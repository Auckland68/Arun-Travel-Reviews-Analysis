We are already planning our next trip back. The grounds are so beautiful and there is an indoor and outdoor pool, small gym and games outside. The bar area is really nice and comfortable and a great area to sit outside too. It's a little paradise escape there!

105,Navigator,Accommodation,Bognor,B&B/Inn,350,Good value for money,"I was given room #5. Small room but well equipped, with everything necessary. Only surprising detail is the shower in a corner of the room, Probably necessary due to insufficient space in the toilet/washbasin. Noise from fan just outside window stops around 10pm. As the room is at the back of the building, the only barely perceivable noise came from someone snoring in the adjacent room. Excellent be and very clean linen. Overall given the price, the plentiful English breakfast and the better than average coffee, well worth spending the night, probably not more.",1.0,3.0,0,0

396,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,23,yuck! avoid new pool it‚Äôs disgusting,"we decided to return again for the bank holiday weekend after hearing that the old and grotty pool was being replaced with a new state of the art leisure pool! what a huge disappointment!!! there is only one word for the place ! disgusting..
it‚Äôs not been open long and it‚Äôs a mess. parts of it are falling off and the place is so dirty it made me feel like i needed a tetanus shot! the changing area was so disgusting and dirty with hair and rubbish everywhere. not once did i see anyone cleaning. as many have said it‚Äôs most definitely not centreparcs!
then to add to it you can‚Äôt even accompany your children down the main slides as they are restricted to under 18?? only! i‚Äôm not sure why??? so there was very little for me to do but walk around looking at the state of the place which is supposed to be state of the art but is in fact filthy and breaking already!
then we move onto the fairground rides. half of these were broken down so basically we moved between three!
i‚Äôm sorry butlins you have really lost your edge! in tough times you will not get the customers if you don‚Äôt buck up your ideas. the state of the pool says it all. if you can‚Äôt get that right what hope do you have!
can‚Äôt see us returning, i‚Äôm paying the extra and going back to centre parcs
very very very disappointed

317,Bailiffs Court,Accommodation,Littlehampton,Hotel,1,Very disappointing spa trip,"Booked an afternoon spa trip to celebrate my birthday. Staff appeared disinterested and got our booking wrong. The spa was over booked meaning that getting a lounger was difficult and we had to share for a proportion of time. The sauna and steam room were very small, so we had to wait for others to finish. We then booked an afternoon tea. The staff were rude and the scones were over baked and were more like a biscuit. Left feeling very disappointed and will not be going back. I have been to several spas and have always felt well looked after apart from here.

156,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,191,My first time in Bognor Regis. Enjoyed every moment and got to meet Stephen Mulhern,"I‚Äôve been going to Butlins in a regular basis for 10 years but I normally use the Minehead one as that one is closer to home. This year I‚Äôd tried Skegness for the first time and enjoyed that back in May so I thought I‚Äôd try this one in Bognor Regis. I got to say the camp is really good and like Skegness it is quite small. I had one issue with checking in though as they didn‚Äôt have the welcome package ready for me so I thought I‚Äôd give them a benefit of a doubt on that one. Eventually had my welcome package so went to my room. It‚Äôs a silver accommodation and unlike the Minehead and the Skegness ones, these ones were just apartments rather than chalets. It was a nice room but the only issue with it was the door not shutting properly and having to force it to shut. I suspect it needs planing down with too much paint or something but other than that it was in a really good spot. The entertainment was top class as always, the food facilities were great and this one includes a Papa Johns pizza which isn‚Äôt present in the other two Butlins camps. I also enjoyed the ocean spa and paid ¬£22 for the 2 hour session and it was worth it, felt really relaxed. The highlight of my holiday was of course meeting Stephen Mulhern at the end of his show. This was the second time I met him after previously meeting him in London back in 2012 after a Catchphrase recording. He was lovely to me and the other people too. Even reminded him that I‚Äôd previously saw him and it made him smile. Shook my hand, gave me a high five and complimented my T Shirt. A truly unforgettable experience coming here. The camp itself was easy to find my way around, music being played everywhere reminds me of being in Alton Towers or Euro Disney. Will definitely be back here again at some point next year. Already got Butlins booked for New Years Eve but will be in the usual Minehead one for that. 8/10 overall for this break üëçüèª.

195,Royal Norfolk,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,65,Needs an update,"Stayed for 2 nights, on the plus side the check in was easy and the receptionist was informative and polite, unfortunately this is pretty much were the plus(s) end..

The room was large enough and was clean, the carpet could do with being renewed and had an iron mark by the end of the bed. There was only 2 tiny bars of soap, no shampoo / conditioner etc. There was instant coffee and tea but no bottled water.

The breakfast was an experience, we arrived to an almost empty dining area and the waitress wanted to seat us by a window in direct sunlight and almost on top of a couple of gentlemen on the table next to us, the tables were so close. The waitress said she would have to ask her manager to change our table . . . The dining area was empty???

The manager appeared and said they had a coach party and they had allocated tables. OK, but we are paying guest too! She reluctantly moved us to another table and we ordered breakfast. Breakfast arrived, the toast was cold and brittle (been made a while) and I had a long hair in my baked beans, I did not eat the breakfast and asked the waitress to take it away, I was offered a replacement, but declined.

We left for a day out and on our return our key card did not work, but it was ok because our room was OPEN!!! This was the last straw, out all day with our belongings unsecured, all my work files, personal documentation! I went to reception and informed the receptionist who said she would speak with the housekeeping manager in the morning.

The hotel is located in a great location, right on the beach and very close to town, it has a wonderful potential and just needs a few changes and some TLC and it would be a great place to stay.",4.0,3.0,0,1
347,Swan Hotel,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,50,"Not worth the money for an ""indulgence room""","Didn't feel ""indugent"" at all! The walls and paint were scuffed. The double bed was two single divans pulled together so you slipped down the middle of the two of them. No bath, only a bare windowless shower room with lino on the floor. It is stated that not all rooms have a bath but the bathroom itself was tatty, with a cracked sink and toilet lid. Decor was more plain than stripped back. The furniture was stained with other people drinks. No minibar or fridge.

Positives - The room was clean. The bed was comfy if you didn't go close to the middle! A complimentary bottle of Proseco as it was our anniversary. The pub is excellent and the staff and breakfast both faultless. The fault does not lie with the staff or their hospitality. Fresh milk for tea in the room.

It was a large and okay b&b type room but lacked a level of polish that I would expect at this price. I felt mis-sold by Fullers, the room I got is only featured in one of their photographs (and only on the separate booking companies website) whilst the rest of their rooms look far more ""indulgent!""

64,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,111,We need a Butlins abroad!,"We need a Butlins abroad! Fantastic hotels, fantastic service fantastic entertainment and activities.

We stayed in the Wave Hotel on 6th floor again it is a well-designed hotel with a separate bedroom area for the kids with TV DVD players for both bunk beds and in the main bedroom, it has a fridge and tea and coffee making area and a safe so all you need in a family hotel room; I wish other hotels had this layout on offer.

It was very clean and the cleaner was very conscientious and dealt with the small issue we had very quickly, what she did with making the towel animals and my child‚Äôs teddy bear was very nice also.

The food was good we had a dine around option but mainly ate in The Deck restaurant but had breakfast in The Ocean and Shoreline hotels which was more less the same but with less people, the staff cleaned the tables thoroughly with sanitiser which is needed with the children serving themselves and putting their hands everywhere!

The things they need to improve on is the queues for The Centre Stage and Reds, queues collect prizes from the arcade machines and queues in general, I have never seen such an orderly queue in a bar before, I found it very funny and British but it worked and was nice to see people not trying to push in and just being nice.

They could also improve on having a ticket, to get a ticket to give a ticket to use an activity it seems to be waste of paper and time and queuing! They should do online bookings for these things and you just bring the booking details to the activity cutting out needing to queue at the Leisure Hub.

I have a 13 year old and a 11 year old I would have like to see more group activities for teenagers at the start of the stay so she could make friends. The karting activity at 9am in the morning is not ideal for teenagers later in the day would be better. Also, I have girls and would like to see at least one sporting activity like football for girls only to encourage them to join in as these things seem to be always dominated by the boys which could be off putting for some girls.

All in all, we found the activities good and well organised and all of the staff at Butlins friendly and approachable.

We will be back!

Luckily for us they just had one left, but only for one night. We took it and also made a reservation for dinner in the restaurant.
The room was wonderful; clean and spacious with high end toiletries in the en-suite. The bed was extremely comfortable.
The dinner was amazing. My husband had steak and lobster, he said it was the best he‚Äôs ever had. I had cod on a bed of chorizo mashed potato with mushrooms and saut√©ed Swiss chard. It was delicious. Oh and I couldn‚Äôt resist dessert, a raspberry and lemon curd roulade with ice cream. Worth every calorie.

291,Church Farm,Accommodation,Littlehampton,AccomOther,6,Disappointed - massive change in a year,"Just come back from a week at a privately rented caravan. The caravan, the grounds and the majority of the staff are great and have kept a similar standard every year we have been there. However the clubhouse, restaurant have really gone down hill. The games room had no air con all week, the machines kept braking. The guys working in games area were really helpful but having used some of the machines for the last few years the difference was really quite noticeable. The restaurant, what‚Äôs happened. Price has gone up and the quality gone down. Food looks like it just thrown on the plate. Kids food supposed to come with veg, the only one that did came with raw, dried up carrot swirls that were all dried out!! Having eaten in the restaurant most nights for the last 3 years, we only went twice and said we wouldn‚Äôt go again. Salmon salad was like old bits of lettuce that should have been thrown out. Stir fry was over cooked, sloppy and tasted horrid. Chicken burger came with a small handful of thrown on chips, rest of the plate was empty. I understand it isn‚Äôt a 5* restaurant but having had some nice food and service from that restaurant before it was more noticeable. Every drink we ordered came in dirty glasses, we were told it was just water marks but they were grim with lipstick marks, old bits of dried lemon!! Tried to get a slush on three occasions, each time the machine wasn‚Äôt working. It‚Äôs a shame as the clubhouse as always been good value for money but this time it was awful.

48,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,3,Wouldn't go back in a hurry,"Just got back from here, Monday- Friday, 2 adults & 2 toddlers (twin girls 2 1/2 years old) We booked a ""Gold"" apartment.... nothing ""gold"" about it... firstly when we got up to the apartment the front door was open.. walked in it smelt damp and stunk of weed so we walked straight back out down to reception to complain... they were nice enough about it but the excuse was they'd just had an adults only weekend. Anyway they ""upgraded"" us to the Wave Hotel.
The hotel was surprisingly quite nice, friendly staff, we were on the 4th floor with a balcony, we had to bring the chairs in off the balcony because of the kids. mini fridge didn't work so we complained and they replaced it the next day.
They activities for toddlers are a bit limited, firstly the large soft play thing in the main tent kids have to be 0.9m they've section off part of it for toddlers but its really crap its just 3 floors to climb up and 1 slide to get down from the middle to ground floor that's it.. no ball pit nothing.
The fair ground rides they have be 0.9m or 1m even with a parent and the toddler fairground inside the tent was only a couple of rides which our girls didn't want to go on without us which we couldn't go on. we ended up spending a fortune on the little arcade rides ¬£1 a go. The kids loved the arcade putting 2p's in the penny pusher machines.

78,Norfolk Arms,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,3,Rude staff!,"This is is a hotel which can‚Äôt train their staff and when a problem occurs because of it, they blame it on the customers with aggressive rudeness and make them feel really, really awful. Totally ruined our weekend in Arundel.
This is what they did to us...
- I booked this hotel as it came up top of the search with Pets Allowed filter in TripAdvisor. The website for booking was a different agent which was still ‚ÄòPets Allowed‚Äù (to make my point).
- On arrival, we were greeted by a friendly receptionist and 2 other staff. They saw us with our dog and they even petted him etc. The receptionist even told us ‚ÄòYour room is one of the 3 dog-friendly rooms which is outside.‚Äù She even showed us a room where we can have our breakfast with our dog. So they knew we had a dog right from the beginning and gave us the room.
- Next day, at the check-out, a different woman was at the reception. She attacked us by rudely saying ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell us you had a dog? Your room isn‚Äôt a dog-friendly room and it‚Äôll cost us a lot of money for cleaning. You should have told us in advance about your dog like most people!‚Äù. We were absolutely stunned by the rudeness and the lack of customer service! She really REALLY made us furious.
- Why was it OUR fault when we were given that room? We had a dog with us right from the beginning, it‚Äôs not as if we smuggled the dog into the room! She wouldn‚Äôt back off! They charged extra ¬£10 for the dog anyway (which we never complained about), so what was she trying to achieve by upsetting us like that? Unbelievable.
What kind of hotel is that? This woman has zero customer service, and because of that, we would never stay there again.

158,Wave Hotel,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,227,Excellent first stay! ,"Just returned from 4 nights in the Wave Hotel during a Just for Tots break with my boyfriend and our 2.5 year old.

Check in was a breeze and our room was ready before we expected so very pleased with that.

Room was clean and modern, and much larger than I expected. Leo was in his own room with bunk beds, tv at the end of each bunk and plenty of shelf space. Our room has a nice sized double bed leading to a balcony (we were on the third floor) and overlooking the car park.

Bathroom was again clean and a good size worn shower over bath.

There was a kettle and a good sized fridge, as well as dressing area, wardrobe space and a hairdryer. I was very impressed.

Only think that was lacking for my son was a bedguard on the bottom bunk as the top bunk was too high for him, but nothing to stop him falling out so pillow fort it was! And yes, it did work!

Housekeeping was good each day, and all staff very friendly and helpful.

Cleanliness:
Firstly, the hotel was very clean. This is the first thing I pick up on wherever I stay. It was honestly immaculate.

Comfort:
The room was very spacious and the bed and pillows were comfy. Plenty of storage/wardrobe space and ample additional seating in the room.

Value:
Exceptional value for what it is. We had looked to stay at The Goodwood hotel, however this was very expensive. Once we had paid for The Comfort Inn and our taxi there and back, we still had ¬£120 change from what it would have cost us to stay at Goodwood Hotel.

Food:
We stayed for breakfast and it was really nice. We were able to help ourself to breakfast and there was plenty on offer. The food was hot and the service was great.

Hospitality:

We arrived and despite ringing the bell waited ages for someone to check us in. Our room was filthy - all surfaces were sticky and the bathroom floor was sticky and black - it should have been blue but you could hardly see that. The taps were filthy the sink wasn‚Äôt clean and the soap dispensers were empty.
We were there 2 days and saw no one on the reception at all until we checked out so were unable to complain - we were here for a busy social weekend so did not have much time. The only time we saw a member of staff during our stay, he was sitting on the steps outside chatting to someone who was sitting smoking and he had no interest in customers.
Very helpful lady on the Sunday as we checked out and she offered us a refund straight away but said she could not process it and someone would ring me at 3pm that day. Of course no one did. The next day a lady rang and she agreed how dirty the room was - she said he had personally bleached the floor ‚Äòseveral times‚Äô after our stay as it was so dirty.
She offered us a full refund for the 2 days but said another customer wanted to check in so she would call me back. She called back and said that her head office had refused the refund as we had paid such a high rate for the room - 250 pounds for 2 nights. That was not our fault that is what they charged us - and surely an agreement that someone should not pay should not be dependent on what they paid.
W contacted the head office who advised us that the manager (a man - even though we spoke to a lady who said she was the manager) had already agreed with us that they would only give us a 50% refund, and that it had already been processed on their system as us having agreed. This is totally untrue - we never spoke to a man and the lady offered us a full refund and blamed head office. Just a big bunch of lies to fob us off. No wonder the staff are so slack and couldn‚Äôt care less when the head office are setting the same example.
One good point was the lady at reception when we checked out, charming and helpful - she should leave there she doesn‚Äôt fit in with the other hapless staff

Defiantly be booking to come again ! . my only criticism is with young children a bottle warmer or microwave in room would be great .

We are staying in the ocean hotel staff are very nice . Couldn‚Äôt do more for you . Especially the dinning staff . Very friendly made us feel so welcome even when my son was having a slight melt down . Once again tried to make him laugh which worked .

Over all great place for young family‚Äôs ! Noticed they are really good for the disabled as-well . Which goes a long way . Family‚Äôs feel at ease . Which is what you want on holiday .

45,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,45,Fun Easter break and lovely hotel Wave,"We spent a Monday to Friday here in the first week of April. The weather was brutal but we really enjoyed the place. The resort itself was quiet, no queuing for anything really and we were totally impressed by the hotel which was much better than expected. The rooms were very well planned with attention to detail - they thought of everything really.

All the staff were nice, cheerful and helpful apart from the miserable unfriendly man running the virtual reality rides.

We were unfortunate to be there for some very cold weather and this is one of the only niggles really - the resort did not respond to the change in temperature and a lot of places were cold. In particular the lovely lounge bar in the Wave hotel where we would have spent a lot of time (and money) was absolutely freezing. We actually left the resort a few times because it was uncomfortable and otherwise would have stayed there to eat or drink.

We had the old pool for its final outing and it was fine. The kids loved it and while it might look a bit tired, everyone enjoyed it.

The food was as expected. The buffet dining was poor although we only had breakfast there. It was quite expensive but the selection was immense. However, everything was poor quality and cheap ingredients. I would recommend the omelettes which are cooked to order and the fresh fruit and pancakes. Nothing else.

The fish and chip restaurant was fantastic, only a bit more expensive that you might expect but if you do the takeaway and eat on the tables outside, it is cheaper (but not in the sleet and hail!). Papa Johns was Papa Johns - totally fine as you would expect. The very cosy and nice looking coffee shop is extremely uncomfortable with hard seating - not somewhere to spend an hour with a coffee and a book while the kids go off so I used the hotel lounge bar which I really liked. Apart from the cold.

The activities were good value we thought with a ¬£12.00 multi-activity ticket; we bought a few of these and the kids did everything almost. There was really so much to do, no one was bored and any down time was a welcome break and not a 'run out of things to do'. We did visit the beach just to say we had, but it was so cold that it was a fleeting visit. In nicer weather I would have explored the town and coastal area further but honestly there is enough in-resort to keep everyone occupied.

Rooms were comfortable, warm, nice bedding and comfortable beds. The kids loved their little cabin room and the balcony was nice to have. That is definitely worth paying extra for BUT, you really do have to complain about people smoking out there. Even though it clearly says it is not allowed, people still do it so if you have your doors open assuming the sleet stopped for a bit (we did have one nice day!) then you can enjoy your smoke filled room.

All in all this was outstanding value for money for a 5 day break for 4 people.

What we didn't like:
I think you might get the idea that we found the hotel lounge cold! enough said.
the gorgeous looking breakfast hot berry crumble is awful, don't be tempted
Pitchers of cocktails.....seem like great value for money but they are VERY weak
wine selection is dire, bring your own.
BIG DISLIKE: The pool closes at 5pm. This I found to be a real thumbs down. The pool (and resort?) is open to the public on a day basis for a fee so the pool can be very busy. For residents the pool is included in the price and so should be open later for us - this is really unfair to paying guests as we are all then forced into activities which are charged as extra when the children could really enjoy the pool with fewer people, later into the evening. Same with the fair, closes at 5pm and does not open until 11am. Adults also are customers! we might like a bit of a quiet swim earlier in the morning or later in the evening. This would be so much nicer if we could use it in a more flexible time frame. I know you need time to clean it but other resorts manage it with no problems (Centre parcs open 10am to 9pm). This looks like profiteering to me as these are two 'free' activities

Finally a good to know: If you book a twin room be aware that the beds are not standard 3ft singles but 2.6ft - for a fully grown adult they are very narrow. I went with my adult daughter and two younger kids.

Overall, loved our stay and will go back.

146,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,51,Spa day,"Booked as found a voucher, staff were very put out that vouchers were advertised and we should pay the full price. Would not have gone without voucher, would have returned if worth the money, however would not pay the full price. The pool is small, the facilities non existent, the relax room not really relaxing, just a sitting room with 4 loungers, only herbal tea - not ‚Äúallowed‚Äù coffee or milk. As both spa members informed us and questioned guests as to what member actually bought the milk in when it not allowed - really should guest be hearing this?
No dressing gowns or slippers available, not for discount guests anyway.
Had a lovely massage and facial but the time 25 min each was slightly shorter, about 45 mins for both. Must be because we were discount again. Definitely made to feel they were doing us a favour.
However the staff in the bar and restaurant were lovely, very good service. Lovely 2 course meal, have to buy drinks as this is not included, but that was expected.
Won‚Äôt go again, not even with discount voucher would rather save up and pay more (real price) but to a different spa, there‚Äôs a lot of competition near.
The voucher might get people in but I doubt there‚Äôs much repeat business, which is a shame. But really need to invest a bit into the place, and train some staff to make guest feel special if in the hospitality business.

397,Wave Hotel,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,345,Very clean and good value,"Our first time at the Wave Hotel, and we stayed in a Dolphin room on the 6th floor. It was some years since we were last at Butlin‚Äôs but we used to enjoy staying in the Ocean Hotel (which wasn‚Äôt open on this break). We arrived at 1pm (the earliest arrival time for this weekend). Our paperwork said we could check in at 3pm, but we were actually told our room was ready and could go straight up, so that was a good start! The front car park by the security gate was already full at 1pm because they‚Äôd had a private conference and some of the delegates were still to leave, but there were plenty of spaces (at that time of day) in the car park between the other side of the hotel and the chalets.

The room was very clean and everything was in good decorative order. One small observation, which may be a little inconvenient for some, is that there's few surfaces to put your stuff on. With no dressing table or chest of drawers, there are just two small shelves (near the mirror and under the TV) to put bits and pieces on, but we managed OK. The fridge and tea making facilities were tucked away inside one of the cupboards.

I particularly liked the submarine themed kids den. It‚Äôs a very small and narrow room but cleverly designed with lots of small shelves to put things on and both bunks have TVs with DVD players. We were on an adult weekend and previous experience has taught us that sometimes it‚Äôs possible to be woken in the night on these breaks by one or two revellers, but the beauty of this hotel was that I could shut myself away in the kids room (bottom bunk) and not hear a thing from the corridor, as the bunk room had its own door which I discovered eliminates corridor noise. It was strangely comforting being tucked away in there, so for me a definite plus and a guarantee of an undisturbed night, though corridor noise disturbed someone in the main bedroom! Claustrophobics might not agree but I loved it. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs great for families as the parents can peep through the porthole to see if the kids are asleep without disturbing them.

We opted for room only (not being fans of food court dining and preferring to eat wherever we choose), so were looking forward to eating out at the other restaurants on site or in town. We had an enjoyable meal at Papa John‚Äôs, some fast food from BK, and a light lunch in the on-site pub (Beachcomber Inn) which was nice inside but the nachos were rather basic. Not all the restaurants were open on this break, so it was a shame we didn‚Äôt get to try the new Pub & Kitchen restaurant, which was closed for the entire break.

The brand new pool building and complex was due to open at Easter, so I‚Äôm sure will add to the appeal for families, and will tidy up an area which had previously been an eyesore.

Butlin‚Äôs really know how to do hotels in my opinion, with good room facilities (such as fridges, DVD players and kids dens) which you don't often get in hotels elsewhere. They are modern, colourful and have surprising funky twists. The lifts with their underwater decor and music always made me smile on the way up to the room! For the price paid, a very reasonable break and I left feeling that I‚Äôd like to return at some point in the future.",1.0,2.0,0,0

1111,Famous City,Food,Littlehampton,Restaurant,3,cold food and late,"I was looking forward to a Chinese for me and my girlfriend one Saturday night, so I decided to get a delivery from Famous City. This was a BIG mistake and I can assure you there‚Äôs nothing famous about Famous City.
The food eventually came after waiting 2 hours. This is an extremely long time considering we live within one mile of the takeaway. When it came I had wished it didn‚Äôt ‚Äì it was completely cold and soggy. The crispy Chinese food we enjoy was cold and mushy. The food comes in tinfoil lined bags so it had sweated and gone cold. We microwaved the noodles but as the rest of the food looked a mess so we had to throw it in the bin.
I called the takeaway the following day, not really to complain but to let them know of the poor service I received. The guy told me he will tell the manager and he would get back to me whilst I would likely get 15% off my next order. I never heard back or got an apology from them, hence me writing this review. I wouldn‚Äôt go back even with 15% off. I paid ¬£20 for a load of rubbish and the customer service was that of business that simply doesn‚Äôt care.

I last visited in mid February for a Sunday Roast beef dinner and it was excellent, so much meat and the vegetables were cooked to perfection. At under ¬£10 the value was exceptional.

I have often had fish & chips here and they I to die for. The fish is so big and I always ask for a big bowl of tartar sauce.

When I do forget my waist line and go for the pudding, there is a wide choice. I had jelly & ice cream the other day, recently had spotted dick, V. Good.

58,Black Rabbit,Food,Arundel,Pub/Bar,342,Mostly indifferent (or poor) food...no comprehension of customer service!!!,"
We, a group of five friends, meet every four/six weeks for a meal, sometimes trying somewhere different for a change. I‚Äôm not sure who suggested the Black Rabbit.......

None of the food was particularly good and some was dreadful. The whitebait was flabby, steak pie was good (although with a mass produced look), a burger was tough and looked/felt like it had been made ages before and reheated. A steak was tough. None of us risked a pudding.

Whatever we thought of the food we all agreed the service was terrible. Our main course was served about thirty five/ forty minutes after finishing the starters, an hour and ten minutes after we all sat down.

My wife specifically asked if she could have a ‚Äúsmall 125 measure of Sauvignon wine‚Äù. She was told she could have the smaller measure, although a 175ml measure was supplied and when queried the waiter said ‚Äúnot to worry as only 125ml would be charged for‚Äù. Needless to say 175ml appeared on the bill! (My wife left a considerable amount of wine in the glass - the issue was not the money, it was she just doesn‚Äôt want that much wine, and for some drivers the larger measure could put them above the ‚Äòdrink/drive‚Äô limit). Despite the law saying 125ml has to be supplied if requested it is often difficult to obtain. (On this occasion given the lengths gone to specify 125ml I spoke to the local Licensing Authority. They confirmed the smaller measure was legally required to be displayed and supplied if requested. They will add The Black Rabbit to their inspection list. I can only hope they take enforcement action sometime).

As for getting the bill and then trying to pay it......when we eventually got it, we asked for the bill to be split between two couples and one single and to include circa 10% service (why we included service I don‚Äôt know!). Oh no!, ‚Äúthe system‚Äù couldn‚Äôt cope with this meaning the manager had to be found (more delay!). After being told how difficult it was to alter the bill I said I intended to leave my name and address and the bill could be posted on, it was agreed a new bill would be prepared!!!

My advice to anyone thinking of visiting - go elsewhere, there are far better run pubs not far away.

Painting the picture for you. We entered through the rear of the building, with no signage to suggest any sort of entrance, we chanced it and found the entrance via the back as stated. Upon entering, we were greeted by a waitress asking if we booked a table. We did not, so they went off to see if they had a table available for the 4 of us. Whilst waiting several minutes, within that timeframe we were asked if we‚Äôd like to get some drinks. It was just myself and my partners dad that ordered a drink, and the (what we believe to be) landlady named Tracey had given my partner and her brother a funny look for not wanting a drink. Once me and her dad had received our drinks, a group of customers came in. They were warmly greeted and received drinks and seated before us. Fair enough if they reserved a table. Once we were seated, my partner had seen that there was only 1 vegetarian option available on the Mains section, which she did not want, and preferred to not eat anything. This was because, I asked a passing waitress if there were any vegetarian options, and that was the only one available. I understand that it was Father‚Äôs Day and it was most likely a temporary set menu. However, when it states on trip advisor itself that it‚Äôs vegetarian friendly, we didn‚Äôt expect that. More to the point, we asked if we‚Äôd like to order by the waitress, and we asked for a few more minutes. The landlady Tracey came over to take our order. Myself, my partners brother and dad wanted to order and not my partner as mentioned. However, Tracey said something along the lines of ‚Äú i can‚Äôt have a table for four people, only ordering three meals and two drinks‚Äù. This came across very rudely, and we were speechless. Our response was, that there were limited vegetarian options and my partner didn‚Äôt want what was offered on that menu. Tracey suggested something off of the starter menu, minus the cheese because my partner cannot have cheese, insisting she orders something, again coming across very aggressive this time. Anyhow, the offer was refused, and Tracey said she‚Äôll just put the order through and snatched the menus from the table. After discussing what just happened, we decided to leave and take our custom elsewhere. As we were we leaving, we told the waitress why. (Because of the poor service) and left with Tracey, hearing and asking if we were going to pay for the drinks, that we already bought at the bar, in which she served us. Also, over ¬£9.00 for 2 pints, definitely over charged? Given my partners family is from Eastern Europe, I‚Äôd assume she is a xenophobe. Because, why was everyone else served in such a warm and great manner?",2.0,2.0,British,1

Place was very empty,with only two families and two staff serving

They were very pleasant and we were given a table and we ordered drinks. These took twenty minutes to arrive

Ordered food which again took ages,was frustrating as the staff were stood around chatting to two friends who had popped in

I ordered the venison burger. Which to be fair was OK. But had salad on the side which tasted really odd

Friend I was with ordered mixed kebab. There was no lamb so was just chicken and pork. This was inedible. The meat was so dry it could not be eaten

The waitress took on the feedback and looked embareesed and went to talk to the chef. Came back and agreed to take the kebab of the bill and offered a free pudding

We waited ages for food. Had a bad meal so did not want to wait ages for a pudding to arrive

The Italian menu is long on pizza and pasta with not many variations without one or the other. This keeps the cost down at the expense of overall variety. Nevertheless, I had a superb starter of king prawns wrapped in parma ham followed by a delicious lasagne, then a tasty baby fig dessert - all surprisingly good.

Haddock was dry, chips were warm. Not the best start. 3 of us had desserts, one being crumble and ice cream which consisted of half a small melted scoop.
When it came to paying the bill, a senior member of staff deleted my regular cod off the bill as a gesture. He said the cod is sold by weight. I personally feel that people who cannot eat a large piece of fish, as some places it is huge, will be disappointed when they see the small piece of fish in the middle of a large plate surrounded by chips.

325,The Diner,Food,Bognor,Restaurant,2,Very bad service,"Arrived at just after 5 to be told it was a 45 minute wait for food as everyone had just sat down. So we made a reservation and returned 45 minutes later and was sat straight down and was told waitress would be over shortly. 10 minutes later we had to ask the manager if we could order drinks as no one had been over! We waited nearly another 10 minutes for the bar maid to come over and say they didn't have the wine I ordered. Our food order was taken and we asked for starters first. Went with the music wheel for my partner, 2 year old and I to share. It was really disappointing for such a long wait. Half an hour went by with staff sweeping the floor and cleaning empty tables around us when our plates hadn't been cleared. We heard the people around us complaining about the wait. It wasn't busy at this point so there was no excuse. It was getting closer to 7 o'clock and the table behind us obviously wanted to get the the show and had to ask for their dessert to go. My partner had to go up to the bar to ask our waitress for another drink. She never passed the order to the bar maid so he had to go up again. Our waitress walked past and we had to ask her to clear the table. It was like we had asked her to lick the table not just move the empty plates that had been there half an hour. Our 2 year old after being strapped in to a high chair for an hour was getting really tetchy so we had to ask for our food to be taken away.
It really ruined our night because we actually looked forward to trying the diner and actually spent the most money here out of all the other places. The food was also really poor considering we were only waiting for hot dog and chips. My partner had the chilli dog which had basically no chilli on it. The bread rolls were dry and split. We ordered extra coleslaw at about ¬£2.50. The waitress failed to mention both our meals came with coleslaw so we didn't actually need it. When the bill came they tried to charge me for the more expensive wine I ordered thay they didn't have! We complained to the manager on the way out about the poor service and we may as well not have bothered. Her response was 'I don't know what's happened there.'

159,Robin Hood,Food,Bognor,Pub/Bar,4,Terrible Service,"We stayed at the attached Premier Inn, having been in the area attending a 21st birthday lunch, so the Robin Hood was the obvious choice for a light bite that evening.

We opted to have just sharer starters and dessert, but were there for two hours because the service was so slow - you would guess because it was a Saturday evening and therefore busy, but it was not and there were lots of empty tables (which surprised us because we'd booked a table online several days before and could only get 1815 or 2000, so had assumed everything else in between was already reserved).

However, the worst part for us was when we ordered a 0% Kopparberg cider for our 17 year old daughter mid-way through our visit. This was brought over by someone other than the waitress we'd placed the order with, and he immediately asked our daughter for ID. We questioned him and stated that it was a NO-Alcohol drink, assuming he hadn't realised that it wasn't a 'normal cider'; but he insisted on knowing their age stating that it still came under the same alcohol regulations - to which we advised him she was 17. He then said 'that's fine because even it was alcoholic there is no problem, as they could still be bought an alcoholic drink by an adult when eating in a restaurant' - by which time we really couldn't see the point in the whole conversation.....!!

Unfortunately, the episode had upset both our children, and our daughter left the restaurant after the starter not wanting to stay any longer and have a dessert. Our 12 year old son was absolutely stunned by the questioning, and kept repeating 'I don't understand, it was NO-Alcohol'.

We had no issue with the food served, but the service was appallingly slow - and the unnecessary questioning over what was essentially a mixed fruit squash left us all dumbfounded.

(For clarification, we looked into the ID issue after we left, and law only states that under 18's cannot buy or be served alcohol that has a content of 0.5% or more - this 'cider' was 0%, zero, nothing, null, nil - with the exception of a licenced premises serving food when a 16 or 17 year can then be bought an alcoholic beverage by an adult).

The only saving grace really was that we had a Tesco Clubcard voucher to cover the cost of the food, otherwise we would probably have left long before any of it was even served. Our bill left to pay came to a little over ¬£11.00, but we were paying cash so ended up leaving the waitress with a ¬£20 note and telling her to keep the change - as we dared not waste any more of our time waiting for her to come back with it!!

Was informed that they didn't have any calamari and would I be happy with scampi instead. Not a problem. I asked for me steak to be cooked medium rare. When it arrived it was still mooing! Completely rare. I sent it back and had to wait for a replacement meal. In the meantime my son ate his meal on his own. When I got my meal the steak was cooked ok. I peeled my prawns and took a bite. As I did so I looked down and realised that they were completely raw in the middle!!! I spat out what I had. By then I'd had enough. Appetite killed. When we received the bill we were told that they hadn't charged for my meal. I thought well seeing as I hadn't eaten anything damn right.

On arrival we waited at the bar for ages waiting to get served or shown to our table. I ordered a double gin and tonic my husband a soft drink and we went in the garden . My drink tasted very odd. When we went back inside to get something else I remarked on the odd taste and was told they had forgotten the gin!! It was slightly amusing and they were honest enough to explain . We went to our table and there was a 20 min delay before our orders. The food came about 25 minutes later . However it was delicious. We did not order desert because we wanted to avoid another long wait which we had anyway waiting for the bill.

194,The Diner,Food,Bognor,Restaurant,100,Never again ,"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had such a bad meal for ages.

We came pretty early (just after 5pm) and it wasn‚Äôt busy at all, only a handful of other tables busy.

The waiter wasn‚Äôt friendly at all, we didn‚Äôt even get a smile.

The waitress struggled to remember which drink was which, there was only 5 drinks, 2 diet cokes, 1 normal. The normal had a lemon, the diet had lime but she somehow couldn‚Äôt figure out which 2 were the same?! ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The starters came relatively quick but the tato tots were really salty which wasn‚Äôt nice at all.

After 1h 10 since arriving at the restaurant, we then complained our meals hadn‚Äôt arrived. 4 out of 5 of them then arrived a minute later. The chips were cold on mine, my friend‚Äôs chicken was so over cooked she couldn‚Äôt even cut it and another‚Äôs bacon was also over cooked.

We complained and asked where the last meal was. Didn‚Äôt get much of a sorry, it felt like they were annoyed we complained.

The missing meal arrived 10 mins later, it was only nachos so you‚Äôd think you couldn‚Äôt go wrong, but there was virtually no cheese on it.

They then brought some more chips for me and another chicken meal, but at this point I‚Äôd finished my burger and didn‚Äôt really want the chips.

We would have had desserts but at this point had been in there so long and were so unimpressed we didn‚Äôt see the point in waiting to see how they could mess up that!

We got the bill (reduced thankfully, although should really have been free after all that), paid some in cash and asked to pay the remaining ¬£18 on card, split half each. This ended up being ¬£8 on the first card and ¬£10 on the second. How is it hard to half ¬£18?!

Total utter disappointment, a bit of a joke really. Out of the 5 of us, only 1 had no issues with their meal!

The beautiful location almost guarantees plenty of customers for now but they need to be treated with respect if they are to return.

We went for lunch on a busy summer's afternoon. We expected some wait but not so very long - I think they forgot us as once we reminded them we were still waiting, our starter did eventually appear.

The prawn and avocado cocktail was the poorest we've ever tasted. Obviously quickly thrown together- a chunk of avocado, one prawn, chopped vegetables in a vinegary sauce served with stale bread.

They then mixed up our steaks and as we had ordered them cooked differently with different sauces it was not practical to swap. The so called triple cooked chips were flat. The meal was so poor we couldn't face ordering a pudding. We just wanted to leave.

Our table was near the bar and all the time we were sitting there - and it was a long time - we couldn't hear ourselves speak as there was so much noise from the staff constantly loading the glasses into the dishwasher trays and throwing empty bottles into a container.

The girls behind the bar were not great - could do with being taught how to smile and be pleasant to customers as we noticed they were quite curt with some people who had a few queries re the menu.

We were kept waiting to order our meals, and had to go looking for someone to take our order. Prices are quite high ( we were charged ¬£1.20 for soda water and lime - usually about 40p everywhere else). The food, when it arrived, looked ok, but not great. The roast beef was tough, in fact so much was over cooked - the veg was often soggy, whereas the Yorkshire pud was rock hard. The veggie meal included a meat sausage wrapped in bacon. The menu said that extra gravy, potatoes and Yorkshire‚Äôs were free with Sunday roast, but we were charged extra for gravy, and the waitress wouldn‚Äôt take it off the bill until we pointed to it printed on the menu. Whilst the waitress tried hard, it was clear that the restaurant was running on minimum staff, who seemed young and inexperienced.

Outside the restaurant, the back garden area was really scruffy and strewn with litter. The tables weren‚Äôt cleared throughout our entire stay.

All in all, this wasn‚Äôt a great experience.prices were above average, but just about everything else was below average. We won‚Äôt be going back.",2.0,2.0,British,1

Very warm welcome with quite a few people dining in mid-week. Feeling lazy so went for a well balanced set meal and everything was delicious and in a variety of flavours and chilli-ness!

First time back in a long time and was not disappointed. Back then, Steak and Kidney pie was reknowned as best fror 30 miles around AND STILL IS. Thank you.

1320,La Cucina,Food,Littlehampton,Restaurant,23,Great food. Great service.,"My wife and I ate here this evening - second or third time we've been. The food was absolutely superb. Service was great, attentive but not intrusive. Prices are good especially considering the high quality of the food. I suppose our only slight gripe is that it's a little noisy. We really like the way it mimics a busy restaurant in the heart of Italy, with the general buzz of families enjoying their food but maybe a little sound deadening on the walls might help make it just a little more intimate?
Don't be put off though, the food is really superb and you won't be disappointed!

669,Inglenook,Food,Bognor,Pub/Bar,62,Weekend Break,"We stayed at the Inglenook for an overnight stay. The check in process was easy and staff very friendly. The room was well furnished and immaculately clean. The room we were in had a huge four poster bed which was probably the most comfortable nights sleep I‚Äôve had in years.
We had a meal in the restaurant, which was delicious I can highly recommend the pork belly. The following morning we had breakfast which was equally as delicious as the previous evenings meal. A truly relaxing break, very highly recommended.",2.0,2.0,British,0
15,Bailiffscourt Spa,Attractions,Littlehampton,Spas/Leisure Centres,16,"Overpriced, average food, lackadaisical service","Set menu not worth the price. Wine list expensive. Staff largely absent when you need them. Chef has an undeserved amount of self regard. Better gastropubs serve up similar experience at half the price and bother. Hotel largely empty and ordering drinks required patience and good humour. They need to stop staff disappearing all the time especially at those prices. So frustrating because the hotel itself is attractive.

42,Inspire Leisure,Attractions,Littlehampton,Spas/Leisure Centres,14,The New Littlehampton Wave,The New Littlehampton Wave is an impression looking building and the facilities look amazing. It is such a shame that the management does not seem to care about the customers. I have been three times. On each accasion I waited 10-15 minutes to get booked in. I tried telephoning 16 times and no one answers the phones. They just ring. The staff on the desks are stressed and are doing their best. The management have to realise that more staff are needed.
