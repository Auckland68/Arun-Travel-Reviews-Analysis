0,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,2,Disappointing,"Took my little girl to see the ‘Amazing Animals’ 3D show, with a title like that I expected maybe safari animals or animals in the jungle or Antarctica or something. Turns out it’s actually about the worlds most venomous creatures where they had 3D wasps buzzing about, a snake biting at the audience, a shark attacking the audience, jellyfish which come down from the ceiling where the audience are warned ‘they will sting you’ amongst other things. It ends with a gorilla coming out and then chasing the hosts through a door where they could be heard screaming as they are being attacked. Before each venomous creature comes on there’s a rather loud scary alarm that goes off which freaked my daughter out each time it came on. Obviously it’s not real but my daughter was absolutely terrified and was screaming and crying, she was traumatised. There were a lot of kids there who were also screaming and sobbing and trying to hide from it all.
I went to complain to the staff after who were not at all bothered by the sight of my sobbing and traumatised daughter. I got told lots of kids love it and it does state not suitable for under 5’s. But if I had any idea it was about dangerous and venomous creatures I’d never have taken my daughter in. It’s not suitable for kids at all, it’s frightening and unnecessary. They could have made it into a lovely film about animals and been educational too. But the aim is to absolutely terrify children. You have been warned. My little girl had awful nightmares last night since we saw it.
Most of the staff are rude and unfriendly. A lot of places there either close early or don’t open at all for half the week.

Then after queuing was singled out for security check. Says random, but was already written in bold letters on my paperwork) needed photo id, which i wasnt told when booking over phone. Then they wanted the bank card id used to pay to verify i hadn't used stolen card. This is after 18 previous visits over the years! When got into accommodation tv didnt work. Called the number left to report problems- message said service not available! Entertainment very limited throughout day. No 'party dances' of an evening. Shows have an hour between them, leaving you the option of using arcades and losing your seat, or sit twiddling thumbs.....so mich more to complain about i could fill a book. Do not come here. Get on a plane and go somewhere exciting ( and much much cheaper)

10,The Lion,Food,Bognor, Pub/Bar,53,Lovely pub with open fire and friendly staff,"Eight of us met here at 12.30 for a Friday lunch to start a weekend on the south coast. Parking was easy this early and the staff here are very helpful and friendly. The only problem we had was that our table was in the far left hand corner of the pub and it hadn't warmed up yet so we sat for the first half an hour with our winter coats on - less than ideal. The food overall was pretty good... we all enjoyed what we had chosen and nothing was sent back for any reason (my girlfriend had the fish and chips for £9 which was a good sized portion if ever so slightly overcooked while the liver and bacon was very good with plenty of gravy).
When we wanted another beer or bottle of wine our waitress brought them over pretty quickly despite it beginning to get busy in there.
So the main question I always ask myself is would I go again and the answer is yes, we'll meet up there next year to start our annual south coast weekender with our group of friends.",4,1.0,2.0,British,0

13,The Town House,Food,Arundel, Restaurant,81,Upsetting experience.,"When we arrived at the Town House we felt it did not appear as bright and cheerfyul as it does in the photographs. We also found the tables too close together. We were allocated a table at the bar end, in front of a passageway with a view of the unisex toilet door.
My pate-de-foie terrine turned out to be just a small portion of pate which was okay but nothing special. My husband's scallops starter was nicely cooked. My main course of half a lobster was also nicely cooked. Sadly my husband's surf and turf was overcooked and cold. The waiter returned it to the kitchen and the same meal came back re-heated and even more overcooked. The glass of champagne was nice as was the half bottle of Chablis. The waiter was efficient and friendly.
We had made this booking using a voucher from 'Gourmet Vouchers. Our son had given this to us as a present for a special occasion. When we came to pay the bill - which had come to £32 more than the £100 voucher - the problems started. The restaurant had received only £50 from Gourmet Vouchers instead of the £100. This was entirely the fault of Gourmet Vouchers who telephoned my husband the following morning to apologise and to pay the restaurant the balance. We gave the restaurant the receipt for the payment to Gourmet Vouchers expecting them to deal with the problem. The manager told us we would have to deal with it and wanted us to pay another £50 then claim this back from Gournet Vouchers. As they had offered us no proof that they had received only £50, but we had provided them with proof that the voucher was for £100 we refused (leaving our contact details) but paid the rest of the bill in cash. Unfortunately this meant we had no cash to give the waiter the gratuity he deserved. The manager loudly argued that they did not have to take Gourmet Vouchers at all - they do their own vouchers - and behaved as though they had done us a big favour by taking it when they accepted our booking. As we left nobody opened the door for us nor wished us a 'good evening'.
The problems ruined our evening......we could forgive the 'not quite up to scratch' meal but as it was a special occasion for us we would have liked to leave the restaurant with a memory of a happy evening. Instead we left disappointed, embarrassed and rather upset.
We totally accept that the problems were the fault of Gourmet Vouchers but feel the resaturant could have handled the situation far better than they did.",2,3.0,2.0,Other,1

I ordered food for our youngest and myself. At 5.30 just as I had collected our food the soft play closed. The staff then started to clean up the seating area by the soft play where we were sat. They were putting the chairs up on the tables around us, and not quietly either.

I recommend ordering a kids burger instead of an adult one as you get more for your money on a kids meal.

Only 2 lifts working for a 5 floor hotel, so very busy with people getting into there rooms and one time we had to wait half hour for a lift so that was one of the worst parts of this hotel .Hotel very clean and our room- adequate space for 2 adults and 3 children..but was it HOT , so hot in October we had to have our balcony door open every day to cool down, air con did not seem to work either. we had to chase up 3 times for a paid travel cot and then eventually at 5,30pm it arrived just in time for bed time!, so not impressed with that service when it was pre booked months ago .The double bed mattress was absolutely discusting, covered in large stains, thanks goodness a sheet covered it as was horrible to see. and the beds very hard, not the best sleep...The bathroom had plenty of towels, only 2 toilet rolls and NO handwash(remember to bring some) the room was serviced daily except forgotten one day by 5pm and we had to chase up and then ask for more milk , and loo rolls...Hotel restaurant we also booked before and the food choices were very good..breakfast and eve meal. plenty to choose from and cater for children needs too. with bibs and cutlery we always nearly just walked in every time..and staff were happy to help us if we asked for anything. Park so much to do..and entertainment but 3 days was ample to do everything there..the children loved the characters ,puppet shows and main stage shows..and rides in and outside . Not enough for under 1 year old to do, so bit of a struggle as the baby part has been shut down in the sky pavilion which was annoying as would have been ideal.Firework display was great and Halloween eves too. would we go back- yes next year maybe to same time in October, and same hotel, yes as long as lifts sorted out. as a further one broken the day we left! overall we had a nice fun packed time and the kids were all happy to be there and ocean hotel is so much better than apartments in our opinion and was lovely not having to think of meals every day, worth paying the extra for them

23,Cardanom Bay,Food,Bognor, Restaurant,4,Evening meal with friends,"The meal we had recently at Cardamom Bay Bognor was not very good.
We came in at 7pm and had our poppadum’s, then our starter. We were then forgotten about and did not received our main meal until 8.40, this was only following a reminder from ourselves.
Our food had not been prepared and were offered a free drink. When the mains did come out at 8.40 they were rushed and were not to a good standard, two of the sauces were horrible, and the lamb was tough and not edible. We complained at the time and asked for the chief to try them, but we did not get any feedback from this.

I don’t normally leave feedback apart from when the food and restaurant is exceptionally good, but on this occasion due to the low standard and disappointing meal I feel that this needs doing, not sure if this is your normal standard but we were all very disappointed. We did pay the full amount for the meal and the service charge but were not happy with the quality of the food and the service.

Nice little cafe, reasonably priced.
It would be nice to have a couple of simple little rides for toddlers in the same area or a little play area for them. Didn't go to the indoor activities, but the soft play looked good.

The room was a nice size, nice decor and comfy bed. But was dark, very dirty, bathroom taps fell off in my hand, was hot and when opening the window the smell from the kitchens came in!
The service was mixed, every time we sat for a drink/food we had to ask for a menu/to be served and then chase them. Shouldn’t be a surprise we wanted to eat and drink, also bad for their business as they are losing out on revenue by not serving and making people wait.
The eve meal was disappointing, poor produce, small portions and very bland. The chef should not be Proud of that. My breakfast was lame, veggie breakfast with no sausage = one shrivelled tomato, one burn mushroom and a tiny portion of beans, looked pathetic on the plate!
The spa is run down, nice on the surface but tired and so so busy. Couldn’t even get a seat to feed our 8 month baby, loads of towels left and no one overseeing removing them.

The food came out quickly. My wife’s roast beef was dry and tough, my lamb felt like it had come out of the microwave. I think you can tell a lot by the roast potatoes on a roast dinner and once again they where dried up and tough!

At no point during the meal did anyone come and check on us or offer more drinks. We had a desert board plonked on the table after waiting 15 minutes for our plates to be cleared away.

The black rabbit was a lovely place and holds some good memories for my wife and I, but I won’t be recommending it again, and I don’t think I’ll be visiting for a long while.

Fantastic memories they have and it really does go a long way!

Thai mussels as always to start Absolutely stunning flavour, Thai is my favourite to cook and I will never order it anywhere else except here. Stunning!

Added extra as was birthday treat, an addition from the new menu some stunning padron peppers. One of my Absolute favourites. Delicious!!

For main I had the new (improved) trio of fish. The shell on prawns took me back to Greece yum yum. I will have this again and again. This place knows how to cook seafood to a T.

We were so full to order dessert however they kindly brought out some birthday white chocolate eclairs for my birthday on the house. To die for.

We have been back to Arundel several times since and everytime the castle has been closed so this time we made sure it was going to be open! Anyhoo it certainly did not disappoint! The gardens are wonderful and the castle very grand. Me and Mrs M.T enjoyed it all very much. Lots of history and the guides are knowledgeable - did you know, for example, that the current Duke of Norfolk is responsible for state occasions? Not cheap but well worth the money. 5 Maverick T stars for this one.

We’ve been going here for many years but were very disappointed by today’s meal. In general terms service was slow, plates were cold, and food wasn’t that great (potatoes on roast lunch had a pre-cooked feel rather than fresh). However our main issue was for the 2 of us who had liver and bacon, which was threaded with tubes; this made a large amount of it inedible. Our feedback secured us a 10% reduction off the cost of these dishes, which seemed to us a very inappropriate response. Having waited over 15 minutes for the bill whilst they debated our feedback, we couldn’t be bothered to take it any further. So having been a regular customer for many years, we won’t be going back unless we hear of a fairly miraculous turn around!

We weren't told on arrival and none of the party could have paid the final payment amount on their card. We asked the waitress how she could accommodate this and she was very aggressive and said it was up to us to sort it, even interrupting our friend and upsetting her afterwards.

50,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,25,February half term fabulous fun!,"Back again (how we can stay away eh?)!

We stayed in the Ocean Hotel, it looking as clean as it was when it first opened. Freddie at Reception treated us as though we were the only guests he'd met all day - so polite, jolly, taking such great interest in my boys - what a great start!
In fact, every member of staff we spoke to went well out of their way to help us / make us feel at ease, as per our requests. And of course, the legend known as Ritchie....! Thanks Ritchie for the advice you gave my boys, and not just about football either.

With the new dining system we were able to eat in a variety of locations, for both breakfast and dinner (we were too full to eat lunch!) - this gave our stay such variation, no day was in no way the same. And as for the choice of food - I think The Deck came out top favourite, but that along with the Ocean Hotel restaurant and Papa Johns too. Another thing I find that people overlook is the 'background' music playing whilst we ate - it was such an eclectic mix, tunes for everyone, so giving the great age range of our group songs to sing along too whilst we ate, so adding to our fun (I wasn't the worst singer btw!).

My eldest son (genuinely!) beat me for the first time ever on the go-karts - at least I had the ice cream from the 'pink cows shop' (so funny) brought for me this year by the chuffed victor!

We must return to experience the much-anticipated new leisure pool - that's going to enhance our stay so much more.

Thank you Butlins - you've again managed to give my family and I such an amazing experience / stay / holiday / total rest.

Just fab :-)

I called and booked (knowing how busy Sunday's get in a good pub) plus we had a dog - they were more than happy for us to bring him. We had been for a long walk before hand but made sure our boots were clean before entering the pub after seeing signs stating boots should be removed if dirty (completely understandable if ours were!) Unfortunately we walked into what I can only describe as very clicky locals sitting and judging at the bar (I LOVE going to a pub with welcoming locals which I expected but unfortunately this was not the case) and not one greeting from the staff. The first word which was said to us by an older lady was ""please can you leave and take your boots off, you're making my carpets dirty"" no 'hello, how can we help' or anything. I'm completely understanding about the removal of boots when dirty but no dirt was on our boots and quite frankly her attitude stank. I've been the owner of five successful pubs in Sussex and if a bit of mud on a carpet in a COUNTRY pub is an issue then they need a rethink or learn that sometimes mess does happen but a hoover or dust pan and brush can be a quick fix. Unfortunately we walked out and found another humbling and welcoming pub down the road which we had visited prior for a drink. We will not be returning.",1,4.0,0.0,British,1

Had breakfast there on first
And second morning. Chef took order and was super friendly and funny. Food was really good and freshly made.

On last evening decided to treat Friends to farewell dinner at the Inglenook and book the resturant for 4 adults and 2 children.

Meal was super disappointing. People next to us returned their meal (not sure why) and this should have been a warning! I had also seen a previous meal wending it’s way back to the kitchen.

We’re asked a few times if we were ready to order - finally made choices to be told half of them were not available! Now had to start again!

Ordered scallops starter. Small as expected- over cooked and cold! Also I think my husbands had been halved to make a serve and his were almost undetectable on the plate!

Mains arrive. Friends chicken supreme had less chicken per serve than the kids chicken nuggets! Also didn’t look that nice. The trio of pork was ok but not cracklings on the crackled one! Fish was incredibly small and probably should have been thrown back!

Very disappointed.

We were charged for an extra fish which we had actually cancelled when we saw the size on another table and changed for the supreme - which was equally small.

Final mornings breakfast - different staff member. Bit rude. Took order. Came
Out with plates held in a towel. Ot oh - well bacon had probably been kept warm for quite a while as almost impossible to cut and scrambled egg where previously had been freshly made was mushy and sat in a pool of water-microwaved? A pet hate of mine. Saving 3 minutes of time and the worst thing ever! Fork literally fell through it! YUK! Did not eat and left it all. Service staff did not question why I had ordered a plate of food and left it all!

Would not recommend the food or resturant sadly.

The Sunday roast I did not have but just say it all looked lovely. This was with the first chef I in countered who was very friendly. Polite and funny.

As you enter the lobby you are greeted by broken tiles on the floor and a lovely lady who tries to up-sell you a room with sea views. Stupidly I took this option and unless I was sitting on top of the kettle in the corner of the room I could see no sea at all Infact all I could see was a derelict building and an empty car park. Apparently (after asking for the WiFi code) I was informed that the internet is only available on the room directly above the router, not weird at all really !! The bed served its purpose however I have thrown my wrist out trying to turn the radiator on. Moving on swiftly the breakfast is served at 8am downstairs, make sure you don’t enter this room at 7.58 am otherwise you are likely to be arrested and locked up for the rest of your life. As for the service itself it’s all plastic cups and forks that resemble garden pitchforks. We sat down in an empty room and was rudely greeted by the table police who aggressively told us that this table was not ours and we must sit at another one so in fear we agreed. The previous table remained unseated for the remainder of the breakfast serving. I’m not going to comment on the food itself, I simply haven’t got the the energy however I did ask for another piece of toast and the manager came to the table and declined my request stating it’s against the policy and flatly denied me. Her English wasn’t great but rather than making a fuss I just left it at that. After showering and getting ready to leave we were interrupted by a knock on the door, it was thr manger again saying they their state of the art technology states we are smoking in the room.

Beware,"On arrival we - 2 adults with our 2-year-old baby were stopped in front of their entrance stating a child is not allowed. Although booking was done via Hotels.com, Lady came up with a paper stating our booking through Expedia is for 2 adults only. Hotels.com had no answer as to why owner had Expedia reference and said they can’t help as child wasn’t mentioned while booking.
Room information on hotels.com stated room accommodates 2 adults and child if child shares bed with parents. B&B’s website states children are welcome. Despite of this they said children are not allowed and closed the door.
Our fault that we did not confirm baby while booking. The thought of this being a problem never came into our mind as baby co-sleeps with us occasionally and we booked a king size bed for that night. We told hotels.com about the treatment that we got there and we had no intention to stay with such uncourteous Owners. Finally, after a struggle of an hour, we arranged alternative accommodation via google. Before moving we just knocked on their door to show their own website policy, to which one of the owners said, ok then a child and mum can stay in the room and also tried to make fun in a sarcastic way. We understood they are after making money without letting us in, hence we left to the next hotel by cursing their rude behaviour.

We didn't book but should have as there were a couple of large groups and as a result we were just in front of the bar. Couldn't really complain as we dropped in on the off chance.

Food was brilliant, bags of flavour and reasonable. The Wine list was above average with most bottles on the higher end of what you'd expect to pay, but you do pay for what you get.

Specials were nice but not for me on this occasion as I'd already decided ahead of time on the choices.

Tips; book early and in advance, clearly a popular choice for locals and mid week. Look at the specials and try the Rioja.

92,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,6,BEST time at Butlins 80s weekend!,"Butlins 80s weekend was one of the best weekends I have ever had! From the moment we pulled up to the resort, a party atmosphere had been created by the enthusiastic and helpful staff. The lady that checked us in was also brilliant! So chatty and cheerful and provided us with lots of great advice on how we should approach and enjoy the weekend ahead.
We were lucky because we had booked silver apartments but were told we had been given ones that had just been renovated and they did not disappoint! We were surprised by the amount of space we had and the cleanliness was of a good standard. The only criticism I would give is that the showers are very small and not very powerful.
There were 14 of us altogether and we were in 3 separate apartments meeting up regularly in the apartment that sleeps 7 people with plenty of room for us all. We headed out on the Friday to the sky pavilion first before hitting the centre stage night club. Great music, great people and a fantastic atmosphere resulting in us not getting to bed until 3am and feeling a little fragile in the morning.
I was lucky enough to escape the hangover so a small group of us headed to the pool party at the splash waterworld on the Saturday morning. This was one of the highlights of my weekend. Again, such a good atmosphere with every one having fun and enjoying the great 80s tunes.
If you’re a fan of activities then Butlins had a lot to offer during the day such as go karts and arcades. We chose to go bowling which was great and at £7, good value for money.
I will say there was not a lot of variety when it came to food but I did enjoy the fish and chips and it wasn’t too expensive. They delivered to our apartment for free and it was a very quick service.
Saturday night was also brilliant where we saw Go West and Pat Sharp before ending up in the silent disco.
Overall we had a fantastic weekend and have already booked to come back in May!Just a little tip....it’s quite a walk from the car park to oyster bay apartments so I suggest just bringing one big suitcase to avoid getting a bad back with lugging heavy bags!!!

The member of staff who greeted us was off hand and dismissive - no eye contact at any point. We should have left then! The place was cold. The Mushroom Wellington was mediocre - served on a plate of 'sauce' and accompanied with chips which lacked any flavour. The one leaved lettuce salad that accompanied the Red Snapper contained random pieces of lemon rind and lots of un- pitted olives. Not what I expected for £14.95.

We booked for dinner and when we sat down later that evening were told basically there was nothing on The menu. Because we hadn’t booked anywhere else or told they didn’t have anything we were stuck with picking a few thing off the snack menu. Food came out at different times and we had finished by the time our daughter got her food as they prepared it wrong. I have always believed in the Hilton chain but this site is terrible and we got far from the usual Hilton experience. What a shame :(

Inside the castle is different as you are paying for the history and tour but they need to reduce the price for just to look at the garden.

I also asked if it would be possible to have either a glass of fizz or a cuppa together whilst we were having the pedicure and was to,d this would be fine.
The duration was confirmed at one hour.
On arrival we were given literally a few seconds to choose a colour of varnish and told not to bother with the swatch book as all the colours were not available.
Then to my surprise my daughter and I were taken off to separate rooms. I obviously questioned this and to my surprise was told that they did not have the facility to do two people together.
The pedicure was done lying down so would be difficult to drink wine or a cuppa.
,there was no option of gel polish and I was told we needed an extra 45 minutes at the end of the treatment for the nail polish to dry.
After painting the first foot, the beautician commented that the polish was nearly finished and was too thick. She said that she had no more and then poured something in to dilute it.
After the pedicure I was directed to a room to wait for the polish to dry. It was dark and cold with no heating on.
I can honestly say that this was not the pampering luxury visit I’d hoped for, and paid for.
I did phone to discuss my concerns and was told the spa manager would call me back. After several days I then phoned again and someone finally came back to me.

The room was ok but you could tell that it needed some work with it- bath had a hole in that looked like it was filled in with some putty. The paint was knocked and chipped away. I was rather disappointed and felt I would’ve been better off at a local travel lodge.

The hotel was dead and it felt like I was the only person in it- no offer for upgrade like most hotels would offer. I felt like the hotel cared more about the money than customer service and experience.

The food did smell nice but due to poor experience from start I ended up going to local competition which I was glad of.

I asked for some more gravy and the waitress who looked so miserable said she would get some. I waited for 10 minutes and still no gravy. I asked again and she said ‘yes I’m getting it’ in a very teenage stroppy kind of way. She then comes out with the gravy in a measuring jug!!!!!!

When it came to the cake and Prosecco, I was refused a glass of Prosecco (despite being 27 and being with my whole family) because I didn’t have my ID. I understood, but to then be told by the waitor that if I tried to drink any he would come and physically take it away from me was extremely rude and threatening.

The fair ground rides they have be 0.9m or 1m even with a parent and the toddler fairground inside the tent was only a couple of rides which our girls didn't want to go on without us which we couldn't go on. we ended up spending a fortune on the little arcade rides £1 a go.

The rest of the party stayed in the chalets which were very basic but comfortable. We found the park very good as everything was close together. We ate at the Beachcomber for a delicious breakfast & the Pub& Kitchen for dinner. We also ate at the Diner where the staff were very pleasant & attentive. Overall we had a very happy stay as there was a very good atmosphere as it being adults only & everyone was there to have a good time.

The staff on reception are helpful and polite so absolutely no problem there.
I personally am booked in here through my work I have little choice where I stay when you work for a very large corporate who do all your bookings for you .
This is my second week of staying in this motel and between 9 am and 12pm the place has become a cresh, the cleaners have obviously brought there children with them to work as its school holidays and yes child care costs a fortune but on the same foot staying here also does.
My job involves working into the small hours and therefore being in bed all day ( or trying to be )
All around the corridors are signs saying please keep quiet people may be sleeping and I Personally hang the sign on the door to say I'm sleeping.
Now I've done this for years and I sleep with earplugs in but sadly here I'm plagued by children playing in the corridors outside my room it's a big place and I've looked outside to have a word with the cleaners but they are not even on this level the kids are just running around being kids because they don't know better.
Just be warned if your thinking of staying here .

The owner is a wonderful character with a good sense of humour. Staff are friendly too.

154,Knights Table Steakhouse,Food,Arundel, Steakhouse/Diner,17,FIRST AND LAST VISIT,"Booked via phone 31st Oct at 14.22pm for Sunday lunch on 3rd November, said we wanted the carvery and how much was it. Was told it was £14 and given the time of 2pm. At no time was I informed there was a ""carvery system"" and now wish I had looked on here and read Helen of Brighton's review of the 18th August. First off they said they could not find my reservation in the book then someone had a look and found it! Told them we wanted the carvery but waitress said she would put our name down for it?? meantime get our drinks. 30mins later still no news re carvery yet see people coming back with food from there (remember we did not know about the carvery system then), asked waitress again how long it was going to be and she said she did not know! Err what about going and finding out for the customer! I had not opened my bottle of drink and we decided to leave then without eating as could see this was going nowhere and it was getting late for lunch, went up to pay for partner's bottle of drink which had been opened and half-emptied (both soft drinks, not that that matters), they then tried to charge me for both, said I was not paying for mine as I had not opened it and had wanted it with my dinner which did not seem to be coming - we had pre-ordered carvery on the previous Thursday and no mention made of their carvery system to which man on duty at counter said he only works weekends! No appologies made whatsoever. This establishment might look the part, but needs vast improvement on customer service, safety, eye sight tests/reading classes and their so called carvery system (never ever come across this before) which I was informed was due to being in a small area with too many people going up and live flames of candles there ... HEALTH & SAFETY is this safe with young children around? Lit candles on all tables, as a family eatery would be safer for battery candles hence still look the part. Our table also was sticky - needs to be spray cleaned after every use, simply health and safety requirements. We really had been looking forward to this but still got our Sunday roast.... further down the road at the Swan... no ""carvery system"" there, and meal was delicious and cheaper!

The menu boasts that the restaurant has been open since 1990 and I can report that it appears nothing has changed since 1990. The once red but now overwashed and faded napkins are arranged in a fan in front of you, the one glasses are the smallest ever seen but also made of the cheapest ‘cut glass’, In 1990 it may have been accepted to do this and also offer low quality food but nowadays with the choices we have of high quality mouth watering Indian food available this just shows its self as a massive disappointment. The shrivelled up lamb chops were absolutely tasteless, the only flavour coming out of them was salt everything comes with a ‘salad’ which is a bowl of lettuce with a single lonely piece of cucumber, tomato and olive.

Whoever answered was curt and most unwelcoming.
No change when we arrived at 7pm on a quiet Sunday evening- customers and welcome sparse.
So we ordered- the waiter was the same man who had answered my call earlier and was surly and unhelpful.
The rose wine we ordered was unavailable and a bottle of Barefoot was offered as an alternative- which is available at 2 for £10 at a local convenience store. He agreed to let us have it at the price of our chosen wine - £15.95.
Food ordered- fairly uncomplicated other than my partner not wanting Lamb tikka on his mixed grill.
Poppadoms and dips were fine - predictably he tried to take them away when we were done so we had to ask for them to be left for our main.
Mixed grill arrived and looked good, apart from the pile of unasked for Lamb tikka - this was replaced with chicken when mentioned.

164,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,17,Very disappointing,"We Arrived May half term with my two children aged 11 & 8 to a “New Style Silver Apartment”. This holiday included no meal plans, no additional extras and cost me a few pound shy of £1000. The website explains you can enter the park from 1pm but cannot access your room/apartment until 4pm. We went to our apartment at 4:30 and the cleaners were still in our rooms cleaning. We were self catering so had to ask to put our food we had bought into the fridge, the cleaners allowed us to do this but not without a look of disgust. The apartment was still dirty even after they had left, windows had lipstick on them, glitter all over the chairs dust on the radiators, scum on the backs of the bathroom doors and chunk of plaster missing from one of the door frames. The kitchen was not well equipped; no frying pan, limited kitchen utensils, a tea towel thinner than a muslin, and bowls that were greasy. We had to ask for another towel, the vague looking guest services employee and explained she’d get one to us that afternoon...it never came.

The apartment is ‘rough’ looking, very small, dark and depressing. They’ve crammed bunk beds into one room so that not even the door will open. They’re old apartments attempting to look new but unfortunately failed.

The swimming pool was the BIGGEST let down. It was freezing. It’s newly refurbished and looks fantastic, but the pool temperature is unbearable. The que for some of the slides varied between 30-60minutes. The pool is open to the general public so it gets ridiculously busy and unfortunately for those who have paid for a £1000 holiday have to suffer the consequences. The changing rooms were filthy; the floors covered in mud.

The entertainment in the evening was ok however people using mobility scooters would often block entrances, doorways and fire doors to park them. I don’t believe there are any parking facilities for these. When we asked a member of staff to move the scooters from a fire door he explained “it was not his responsibility”. This was the last straw in an already horrible holiday.

I’d decided on a Butlins break this year instead of a holiday abroad. I thought it would be easier for my family and also saved some pennies. I wish we hadn’t have bothered.

I feel let down, exploited and sad for my family and especially my children. It was a horrible holiday, please don’t waste your money guys, go abroad, Centre parcs, haven...any. Please don’t give your hard earned money to this cruddy establishment.

My guests live in Bognor Regis and they are regular users and they will not be using the restaurant again either. Our preferred restaurant will be The Cardoman Bay in future.

170,Church Farm,Accommodation,Littlehampton,AccomOther,12,Incredible staff and wonderful memories made,"I am a frequent visitor to Haven sites usually visit a few times every year and Church Farm is one of our favourite places to spend time. On our most recent visit (17-19 May 2019) I would like to express just how impressed I was. My 4 yr old twin girls took part in the mini archery, mini fencing and learn to bike sessions with Callum. His approach with them was brilliant, he was patient and kind and really helped them to enjoy all of the activities.

Ranger Oakley was also brilliant with my kids, my son did the fire lighting session and my girls were too young but Ranger Oakley took time to explain to the girls why and even let them observe the session from a safe distance (with me supervising them also). At the end he let them have a marshmallow and this extra effort he made really helped to prevent them feeling sad about not being able to participate.

I booked my son in for the football session and when we turned up he was the only one booked onto the session and I thought we may have to cancel, however, Harry (I think) the man running the session made a big fuss of my son saying they will do 1-1 skills session and adapt to what my son would like to work on. He really made an effort with him and my son thoroughly enjoyed that session. At the end of the session Callum and Ranger Oakley both joined in for a little while and honestly my son was totally made up with this. (He doesn’t have a dad so for me this boy-bonding with such positive male role models was absolutely incredible for him to experience). Id like to say a heart felt thank you to these three guys for going above and beyond to make such happy memories for my children.

The entertainment team in the Show bar were as always brilliant with the children and polite and kind at all times. The bar staff are always happy and I have never had to wait more than a few minutes for service even when the site is incredibly busy.

The site was spotless and well maintained and the caravans are always spotlessly clean and comfortable. The admin team are always helpful when I call (often ask to link bookings as we come with a group of friends, or at times when my dad has been a visitor they accommodate his limited mobility by situating us close to the amenities).

The security always do a great job and I feel very safe on this site at all times. Special thank you to Ray for his positivity and for always having a smile and a high five for my kids even after the 14,000th time of passing by.

Honestly, I can’t recommend Haven Church Farm enough. The staff’s dedication to their jobs are a real credit to the company. Thank you for helping me in making wonderful memories visit after visit with my children.

This was after placing the order as the waiter didn’t know where the dish was on his tablet then came back. She was advised that if she wanted the shrimp as well it had to be the starter??? Made no sense...

Drinks took ages (had to ask), food took ages (had to ask) then I sent my chicken and waffles back as it was over cooked, dry and burnt (see the photos). The bacon tasted of charcoal, the chicken breast was dry and chewy... even the waffle was crispy and overdone. How it cleared the pass I have no idea, but a replacement came out quite quickly so I assume I was given someone else’s dish. Sorry to whoever that was!!

We asked Guest Services what we might expect from daily housekeeping which we had paid for and were told only beds were made & bins emptied unless we requested otherwise. This is hardly daily housekeeping and we never saw the housekeeper to ask for more cleaning. Reception staff were apathetic to our complaints and so we bought some cleaning materials ourselves to get the job done. We could only access the cutlery drawer by opening the fridge door first (bizarre) and the fridge had door struts missing so the milk fell out every time it was opened!

However everything else was appalling. Firstly the service. They take orders before the speaker giving the kitchen a good hour to prepare. But instead of bringing the meals for one table at a time, the staff wander around asking who ordered what. Two ladies on my table received their meal at least 10mins before the rest. The vegetables which came first, were cold by the time all meals arrived. So the service is chaos.
I ordered chicken Caesar salad. After one mouthful I didn't eat it. No crisp lettuce, no croutons and no parmesan cheese. Chunks of chicken in a dreadful sauce. The other meals were no better. Burnt salmon and a burger bun still partly frozen.

The first thing you will notice with this hotel is how friendly all the staff were. From the reception desk, to the bar staff, to the cleaners. Always polite and helpful.
The hotel is clearly old, and weaving through its corridors and stairways gives a real sense of its history. The room itself was tastefully decorated and very clean. The bathroom in our room did not have a shower, but the bath added to the overall relaxing experience.
For £5 a night we were able to leave our car in the car park. The location of the hotel meant we could enjoy a full day walking on the South Downs without having to drive.
The breakfast included was continental followed by a full English, vegetarian option or fish breakfast available. All very nice, but if there was one small criticism, the sausages could be improved.
There are plenty of bars and restaurants within a couple of minutes walk. However we enjoyed the beer in both of the hotel bars.
The deal we had on this room was amazing, and it would be hard to stay anywhere for that price.
Overall a wonderful weekend away in a wonderful hotel. Highly recommended!

Wallpaper was stained and peeling off the walls.

Skirting boards were cracked and coming away from the walls.

Ceiling in the room was showing cracks and starting to bow.

Ceiling and walls in the bathroom were covered in damp patches and the paint was flaking off.

Dead flies on window sill and all edges of the window the sealant was cracked and covered in grime.

For the price I paid this is honestly the worst Hotel I have ever stayed in and the Hilton should be ashamed to be charging people to stay in such a shocking environment.

When I approached the front desk staff they said they would offer me a discount of £20 as a good will gesture.

Apart from that query we would recommend it whole heartedly. The staff the entertainment is brilliant but the queue is horrendous for the pantomime we had to queue for an hour to get a seat where our grandson could see.

We had a photo shoot at Splash and after we had walked around the pool areas taking photos were told to return the next day, I explained the next day we would be about 200 miles away, and asked why I wasn't explained that beforehand, girl shrugged and said contact guest services. Went to guest services, closed. Phoned them the next day, then told to phone photo booth, several calls later was told I couldn't have them due to GDPR. Contacted customer service ... not interested in my issue, nor my time being wasted like this, and when I said that they should tell customers that if their photos were taken after 4pm, that they had to be in the resort in person the next day to collect them (ie not to waste our time as customers in a fruitless excercise), customer service respond, and I quote 'your comments regarding this being communicated to guests will be kept in mind for future discussions'. That they will only 'keep' this 'in mind' for 'future discussions' makes me think someone needs firing in their customer service department, and as for my wasted time just an empty word 'sorry', not even ""oh hey look you wasted part of your day and an hour or so trying to get your photos by contacting guest services, etc, as the girl advised you to do, here's a 5 pence voucher to buy a sweetie"". I got nothing for that, just ""Yeah, sorry about that"". If you think that is customer service, honestly you need to have a massive rethink.

241,WWT Wetland,Attractions,Arundel,Nature/Gardens,23,Always a great day out,"Love visiting here as it's really accessible for me in my manual wheelchair. There's plenty to see on the way round and the majority of paths are tarmac or boardwalk with only a few slopes - the route to the butterfly garden is woodchip (I think) so that's more tricky to wheel over and I've only tried that once because it's too difficult. Hides have ramps and wheelchair areas inside, so you can get up close to the wildlife.

Since visiting earlier this year, they've improved accessibility even further by getting rid of the manual double doors and replacing with a wide single door which is operated by a push pad, making it much easier to open.

Staff are always friendly, I once had to get a chap to push me back up the slope from the pond dipping shed because it's very steep, and he was very helpful.

Diving duck feed is fun and informative and the boat trip is always a treat, staff friendly and knowledgeable, and it's a lovely way to relax after wandering round.

254,Church Farm,Accommodation,Littlehampton,AccomOther,53,Nostalgic trip back to Church Farm,"We came here on the Sun Newspaper £9.50 holidays and I chose Church Farm as I had many holidays and happy memories coming here every year as a child before Haven took it over so it was a real nostalgic experience.
We were greeted by Ray who is on the security gate as you enter, very nice chap who made us very welcome. The check in staff were very professional and polite.
When I booked the holiday I upgraded to a comfort plus caravan and we were extremely happy with it as it had multi room heating, as the weather was very cold this was a bonus. We were in Ballast Rise which isn’t too far away from the entertainment and swimming pool etc so it was a nice short walk to get there.
Our only gripe when we entered the van was that the cleaners hadn’t hoovered the floor and dining benches and they were covered in bread crumbs.
We were given a three bedded caravan and this was very welcome as when we hired a high chair for my friends little toddler the very helpful chap that bought it along didn’t hesitate when I asked if he could move the single beds in one of the rooms so we could place the travel cot in there.
You will need to bring your own cleaning products i.e washing up liquid, washing up sponges and tea towels and oven gloves. There’s lots of cutlery, utensils and crockery supplied though. Nice big TV too.
The park is very well maintained, we loved the indoor swimming pool, the amusement arcade and soft play area was such fun for the little one. There is a restaurant called Mash and Barrel which we ate in one afternoon, the food was really good. There is a shop on site too, but further down the road is a local Tesco express and near the seafront is a CoOp.
We also used the local Chinese takeaway along the road just about a one minute drive from the site called Jasmines, very good food.
We will definitely come here again and looking forward to next time.

260,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,11,Awful stay,"I booked a 4 night break to Butlins in Bognor Regis for my son’s 2nd birthday. We arrived on Monday 10th June to find there was no entrance for those on foot (we travelled by train) we then had to stand in the pouring rain until a staff member found our booking and told us where to check in. You cannot enter your apartment until 4pm so that is a waste of 1 day. We got to our standard apartment in Egret Avenue to discover cigarette ends and broken glass outside the door. Entering the property there was a distinct smell of cannabis. It got worst the more I looked around the apartment. The table was broken, there was thick dust everywhere, the kitchen sides hadn’t been cleaned, there was chunks missing out the floor and table, the bathroom had blood marks on the walls and hair/dust everywhere. The toilet was broken and the whole apartment needed renovating. There was no way I was staying in that apartment regardless of price. I complained to the lady in the Oyster Bay Reception and showed her the pictures of the apartment. She rang someone who said I can be moved to a different apartment. Luckily enough we were moved right next door to my sister and her family. We decided to check out what the resort had on offer... except everything was shut except the arcades and a few restaurants. I assumed it was because it was late in the evening. The next morning my fiancé was making us a cup of tea when the kettle blew up and threw boiling water all over the kitchen narrowly missing my son. This had also tripped the electrics meaning we had no electricity. My partner went to guest services and explained what had happened. He was told it was a priority and would be sorted within 2 hours and someone would come and clean up the water. We stayed in the apartment for 3 hours waiting, but no one turned up. We had to go out as my son was throwing an absolute fit at being stuck indoors. I assumed someone may come and sort it whilst we were out. Unfortunately not. We got home to no electricity and a wet floor still. My fiancé decided to sort the electrics himself and we cleaned up the floor. My fiancé is Type 1 diabetic and needs the fridge to keep his insulin cold. Luckily the fridge remained at a cool level. We never heard anything back from guest services or maintenance during our short stay. We then decided to take advantage of the new swimming pool. Unfortunately the main pool and wave pool was much too cold for my son. He ended up with blue lips so we had to leave there. The children's pools were warm, but much too crowded to actually do anything. We then decided to do some rides, only to find it all shut down. We had no idea that pretty much everything on the resort shuts at 5pm. In summer. Including the pool. This is ridiculous. We decided to go and try The Diner for dinner... which was shut. Then we thought we will try Scoop the ice cream parlour, this was also shut. By this point I had already had enough. What the hell did I pay £400+ for? They charge you for EVERYTHING regardless if you have a pass. Want to ride a go cart? That’s £6 per go! Want to ride a dune buggy? That’s £2 for 1 go. Want to ride the new VR machines? That’s £5 per person. Want to play mini golf? Thats more money. Want to rent a family bike? Thats £9 for 30 minutes. We couldn’t use the outside parks because they were under maintenance. We couldn’t use the soft play throughout our stay as 1 it was just too busy and 2 the toddler section was overrun by bigger kids bullying little ones. So our days consisted of walking around or spending more money on the arcades. I was extremely disappointed. On Wednesday evening after another nightmare of a day (being turned away from the pool because it was for hotel users only in the morning, to finding restaurants shut again and eating the same thing for the third time) we decided enough was enough and we left Thursday a day earlier than planned. There was no one in guest services or reception to check out or to complain to, so we dropped our keys in a box and left. I have never EVER been so appalled by a resort for families in my life. I will never go back. I’ve complained via email and asked for a full refund.

My husband had the lemon chicken, I had shepherds pie and our son had sausage and mash. 3 clear plates here!

Vegetables were fresh and cooked to perfection and we had a nice selection of vegetables too, we’d recommend the home made bubble and squeak croquettes starter too.

266,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,0,90s Reloaded Weekend ,"Stayed here 7-10 June for a 90s reloaded weekend as a group of 7 girls for a hen party. I cannot possibly recommend this event highly enough, we’ve already booked for next year!

The acts were brilliant (except S Club, they were desperately awful!), the venue was clean, well looked after and felt really safe. We didn’t see one argument, fight or single bit of unpleasantness all weekend and everyone was very friendly. Kudos to the staff for serving at the bar so quickly and keeping everything going.

We had two silver apartments next to each other and they were great, very clean and comfortable. Only negatives were that there was only one plug socket in the twin room and very few anywhere else. Also the shower had very poor pressure so took ages for hair washing.

If you struggle carrying things upstairs make sure you ask for a ground floor apartment, there aren’t any lifts. (Obviously there are in the hotels). Fortunately there was a helpful stag group who were happy to lug our bags.

We didn’t bother with the dining package and we’re pleased we didn’t. The supermarket on site is very reasonable and there’s also Burger King, hotdogs, Papa Johns etc that’s cheap and easy.

Toilets everywhere were well kept and always stocked with loo roll - cleanest toilets I’ve ever seen at a three day music event!

Highlights of the weekend were the Vengaboys, Peter Andre and the comedy club. They all put so much effort in and really put on a great performance.

Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone and can’t wait for next time!

Allowing pets into a restaurant is a strange idea and having 2 yappy dogs behind you when your trying to have a nice family meal for a birthday celebration is not my idea of fun.

Pudding well.....

We asked for 2 x 3 scoops of ice cream. 2 toffee and one chocolate and one vanilla and 2 chocolate.
The waitress didn’t write it down and when the order came it was wrong. We told the young very done up with makeup who then returned to correct the order.

289,The Norfolk Tap,Food,Arundel, Pub/Bar,6,Aggressive reception from the guy that ran it,"So last week my partner and I walked into the pub, it seemed to have a nice vibe and we were going to sit outside with a nice cold alcohol free beer.

The young guy behind the bar was very sweet - he's the reason I am giving The Norfolk Tap 2 stars rather than 1. The young guy asked how we were and what we would like. I asked what alcohol free beers they have - they didn't have any, but he said he could pop across and get a couple of Becks Blue for us from the hotel - we were more than happy and grateful that he would do that.

Then someone said very loudly in an aggressive tone ""why would you do that"", I didn't realise he was talking to us at first, then he said it again but louder. I assumed it was just a local at the pub, drunk having a joke. But I looked at him and he said very seriously ""Why would you come in here and order an alcoholic free beer, WHY?!"" I explained because that's what we wanted.

He then proceeded to go on about how he ran the place and didn't understand why people came in and ordered alcohol free beers. He was hostile and aggressive. Not a very nice way to greet new customers at all. He could see I was quite shocked and taken aback by what he was saying so started to backtrack. He kept saying we should try the 3.6% beer as it is low alcohol, I tried to explain to him that we aren't drinking. He couldn't seem to comprehend it at all. He said there are no good alcohol free beers so he wouldn't stock them. Which my partner and I both said there were lots of lovely alcoholic free beers out there. He said ""Well no local breweries that sell them"", I corrected him and told him there were. It's something my partner and I have looked into a lot. One brewery I gave him was the Laine brewery in Brighton - King Limbo is a lovely beer, it's extremely popular in Brighton and Hove, we've actually been told by a few bars and pubs in Brighton they can't believe how much they're selling of it. He clearly didn't know what he was talking about, which is fine, we don't expect people to know everything about non alcoholic beers, as it's a fairly new trend that seems to be picking up. What wasn't ok, was the way he spoke to us and treated us.

We promptly got our Becks Blues (which were smaller bottles than the normal and more expensive than normal as well), sat outside and drank them quickly and left. We were shocked and upset by how the guys spoke to us and certainly won't be going back there. Of course people can have their opinions but if you're running an establishment then you shouldn't criticise customers and keep your opinion to yourself.",2,2.0,2.0,British,1

Some of the pork sausages had some hard bits and the pork meat was a little bit tough, but I couldn’t really complained as the portions were massive, served on gigantic skewers and in the flavour arena it hit the spot.

295,Bailiffs Court,Accommodation,Littlehampton,Hotel,0,Lovely 2 night stay,"My partner and I stayed here as a rest-bite from running our business. We got a deal for staying 2 nights with dinner and had a thoroughly lovely time. The hotel is quirky, and upon reading the history of the hotel it makes sense. Lovely grounds, and very very friendly and attentive staff.
The food was delicious. I'm lactose intolerant and the staff were understanding and attentive to this. Additionally, the chef amended some of the dishes for me - proving that the food is fresh and made from scratch.
My highlight though, was the spa. My partner and I spent most of our time between the pool and the sun loungers. We tried all the facilities and had a massage (which was amazing!). I fell in love with the products they use, was given some lovely samples and am now a customer of TempleSpa products! I was impressed with the temperature of the shower pre/post sauna (cold but not too cold!), the abundance of available towels, helpful staff, testers and products every where to aid the experience etc etc. So many little details to make if feel luxurious.
Whilst there, I happen to overhear another customer complain to the Spa Manger that they didn't like the redecoration (it hadn't been completed) and general grumbling. I felt the complaints were totally unjust; but I was impressed with the polite, emphatic. and dignified way the Manager handled this customer stating that it was all work in progress and that they had all been working hard on the revamp. I can only imagine the long hours that go into a revamp of a spa.
Well done guys, looking forward to coming back soon.

Some way into the meal my wife discovered a burned area inside the pasta dish too.
Very unpleasant.

My meal was a Pizza Carbonara, which had large lump of black carbon on the plate with it, and the egg in the centre was hard. All around the edges, the base was so hard baked that I could shatter it in many places with a tap of my knife. I requested a replacement soft egg which was provided without fuss.
Neither of us was able or willing to finish the meal.

We were looking for somewhere to have lunch and had previously been in the Diner for milkshakes earlier in our holiday and thought it looked like a good place to have lunch. However after picking our food from the lunch menu and looking forward to our food we were told we should not have been given the lunch menu as the previous day there had been such a delay getting the orders out from the lunch menu so they were not offering it yesterday!!!.. my husband and I were very annoyed as by this point we had all drank our drinks and made our choices and instead of having a reasonably priced lunch now only had the option to pick something from the main menu which was much more expensive and our disappointment and frustration meant we did not fancy anything from the main menu but felt it too late to leave even though I very much wanted to just pay for our drinks and leave and find somewhere else. So we made another choice and ordered the children their meals and were all disappointed with our food. My son ended up his tears he disliked his meal so much as the pulled beef in his taco's (which were supposed to be make your own but came already made up) was so spicy he spent most of the time soaking his tongue in his water and my daughter left most of hers as she said her chips were awful and the burger not much better. I ended up giving most of my dinner to the children so they had something to eat and got the bill leaving with a bitter taste in my mouth of the whole experience and paying £46 for some lunch!..

I booked a room at Arundel Fontwell for one night for myself, my husband and my 7 year old. On arrival we were greeted in a friendly manner, given our keys and directed where to go. Luckily this wasn’t too far as being pregnant I was already exhausted! On opening the door to our room it smelt of cleaning products which is always a good sign! And it felt clean. The bathroom itself was clean and there were fresh towels. There were spares on the shelves just outside of the bathroom which is handy! In the room there was a king size bed along with a pull out single for my son to sleep in. Both in clean condition, clean sheets and both beds comfortable. Extra pillows on the selves as well as a fan if needed. A TV was available with freeview which was ideal as we spent the evening relaxing. There was a kettle with cups/sugar/teabags/coffee/milk for tea and coffee which we didn’t use in the end but was nice to know this was available to us. There is no restaurant on site but there is a Burger King/KFC a 5 minute walk around the corner. There is also a little Pub a few minutes drive away that we passed but did not go in. Chichester itself is only a 10 minute drive away from big supermarkets (Sainsbury’s/Lidl etc) which is ideal if you are staying away for a little time. Overall the room we stayed in did the job for us, there was barely any noise even though the Travelodge is situated by a busy road which some people have previously mentioned in other reviews. It may have been the room we were in but given that we only spent the night it did the job nicely. Thank you very much to the two members of staff who welcomed us. Will be back.

The so called entertainment was boring and chiefly aimed at children. The later evening shows were just a repeat of the same boring 'pretend' singers that have been there for goodness how long. I only saw 1 redcoat during my holiday and she didn't bother to speak or smile at any of the guests. I have been holidaying in Butlins for many years, but this could be the last time. The new pool has no viewing area and there is no real place to actually swim. It is also very expensive in the shops, you can buy the same goods in Bognor town centre at more than half the price of Butlins. The food in the restaurants is fairly good, but is cold by the time you get to your table! It is very expensive for not a lot now.

I’ve never had chicken so succulent & tasty, I had chicken tikka, others in the group had a madras, korma, garlic chicken & a prawn balti. Every one of the dishes were divine.

338,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,1,Disappointed family holiday - rubbish customer service,"Before I start, I’ve been going to Butlins skegness for the past 6 years with no issues having great holidays with my young family. Bognor Regis is totally different!

Accommodation
We stayed in a silver room. It was clean and tidy on arrival. However, the floor was quite uneven and the front door didn’t open all the way as it caught in the opposite wall in the tiny hallway. The bathroom was very basic (as you would expect) but the shower was very hard to climb in and out as it was higher than your average step. The toilet was letting water through every 30/40 seconds. I reported this but it didn’t get fixed until I found a maintenance guy who was very helpful and fixed it for us.

Resort
Was clean grounds well looked after but some areas are looking tired.

Dining
We had paid the extra for premier dining. We have used this dining several times at skegness and loved it. Totally disappointed at Bognor - no live stations as described, all self service. People that where meant to be chefs had no idea what they were doing.
I complained onsite at guest services. Belle - a member of the team said that’s just the way it is at Bognor and the two sites are totally different. She stated that I would have to stand corrected when I mentioned never being allocated a dining room at skegness! She stated I could ask for something off the grill at anytime. I asked several times and was told that this wasn’t allowed. They did get me things when I persisted but I shouldn’t have to as it was part of the package I had paid for! One particular night I asked about the grill menu and was told it was cheese burgers, but they where also on the self service so I could “make one myself”!! Not quite the same experience!!

Funfair
Very good. My children loved the swings and the sizzler ride. Felt very safe again.

Pool
Brand new pool opened this year. The children loved it. All the rides where open and well staffed. It did feel busy at times. The changing area floor is very slippy so just watch little ones in there. They don’t have changing room attendants like st skegness.

The outside area was not cleared up when we arrived with plates, food and empty glasses on a few tables - this is just not acceptable. Cigarette butts were all over the floor which clearly weren't from Monday alone and the chairs and tables looked grubby. The decor inside just doesn't work - the pub doesn't know what it is. Querky might describe it, but, what would work here is a traditional country pub with some atmosphere and ambience, tastefully decorated and in keeping with the village. The seating arrangement inside just doesn't work either and I couldn't have imagined eating here as a family - cant comment on the food, but it looked like it might be from a fryer. The male toilets smelt nasty and again were very tatty....such a shame. We have been here before and it just looks worse....such a shame as it could be so much more.

This was almost twice the price of the local Premier Inn but at least with a Premier Inn, you know what you’re going to get.

356,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,3,Centerparcs this is NOT,"With a young family we have stayed at Centerparcs many times and thought we'd give Butlins a try.

We booked a Nelson stateroom in the Shoreline Hotel, arriving on the hottest weekend this year.
 The air conditioning was broken. It took the team 4 hours after much pestering to inform us it was not repairable(no surprise)
After a visit to assess the heat level they agreed it was not acceptable and we would be relocated.
This was to the Wave hotel, the other side of the complex. It was gone 8pm. We were unable to move the car as the Wave car park was full. We trapsed with kids in pyjamas ladden with bags across the complex,with not one teeny weeny offer of help of anysort.

So just be aware, that is the level of customer service they offer if things go wrong.

You can pay very good money but don't expect the level of courtesy to families that Centerparcs on the other hand offer.

On a positive note the show was great,rides well staffed, pool lovely(though not quite as good as Centerparcs) But be prepared for spending a long time queuing for ...everything!
Hope this may just help if you are considering a first visit with little ones.
We lost a precious day of a very short weekend break with overtired kids, thanks to Butlins.

368,Knights Table Steakhouse,Food,Arundel, Steakhouse/Diner,32,Very Poor Carvery,"We went to the Knights Table for a family birthday lunch on Sunday. After reading the many excellent reviews we were really looking forward to a lovely meal in a relatively new restaurant in Arundel.

Unfortunately our experience didn’t match the reviews.

After ordering the carvery for all of us we were told by the waitress that there would be a little wait, about ten minutes, while the carvery was ‘freshened up’.

However when we reached the carvery we were greeted with beef that had literally been seared on the outside and was raw and very bloody, 2 chicken pieces that were so pale they also didn’t look cooked and gammon that was over cooked and incredibly fatty. With the benefit of hindsight we should have refused the carvery and ordered something else but stupidly not wishing to make a fuss we carried on with it. In reality the food should never have been offered to us. There were little veg, the carrots had almost run out, the Yorkshire puddings were cold and tasted like cardboard and the roast potatoes inedible.

Interestingly, soon after we had been served, the carvery food was cleared and replaced. Perhaps we chose the wrong time to eat but again we should never have been served such poor food.

When the waitress cleared our plates, saw how we had left most of our food and asked how our food was she said ‘thank you for being honest and we welcome feedback positive or negative’ but with respect these are clearly just words.

Oh and for the record my husband would only have given a one star, not two as I have.

Whilst the decor is quite quirky, the hard wooden bench seats we were given were quite uncomfortable.

Unfortunately, we will not be returning to the Knights Table which is a shame as we do like to support local businesses.

The prices since I book days ago have dramatically drop nearly £200 for the same time in July. I saw online that thr lowest price is guaranteed. So I decided to call and see if there was anything butlins could do since it hasn’t been a week since booking. Well the first lady I spoke to was absolutely useless. The second lady tried to help but I have been told as I book the last apartment available the could not do anything! This is absolutely ridiculous I cannot even cancel and rebook as I would no be receive all of my money back and if I upgraded it would have to be done on the price which I would have received on the day of booking, even tho the price of a upgrade to the difference would be less than £10. I am absolutely disgusted and this will be the first and last time i will be visiting Butlins!!! I wouldn’t be to bothered if I didn’t book less than a week ago and the deal was meant to be up to 30% off and an extra £40 off and now the deal is and extra 30% off and an extra £30 so im a bit confused as to why its cheaper now. I definitely will not be advising anyone to book with them as you’ll never know when to book to get the best deal. Pictures below of the price difference in just a few days!!!!

The service whislt pleasant was slow although it was a very busy Saturday night. Still that in itself was easy to predict and staffing levels should have reflected this . Everything else was average or worse and the bill was an unpleasant reminder of how poor an overall experience it was . Beautifully situated it could be so much better .

400,Bailiffs Court,Accommodation,Littlehampton,Hotel,29,Quirky property and that’s where the fun ends ....,"During our 24 hour stay, I’m not sure we met a single person who knew what they were doing. And that’s not for the lack of staff. After what felt like a reluctant ‘end of shift’ welcome at the front desk, we were shown to our room at the other side of the site. The guy showing us around didn’t know the facilities and referred us to a new guide in the room and said everything we needed to know would be in there. We we’re left thinking why bother and just provide the key? However when we found our way around the room we just felt it lacked facilities and was old and antiquated - in need of an upgrade!
We had paid for one of the more expensive rooms with a four poster bed. This was probably the best part about it. The rooms are poorly equipped; an old sofa facing and dirty tv in a sitting room area, no mini bar despite being far from the main part of the hotel, large bathroom but the shower stopped working half way through washing and left one of us roaming the room for 15 mins covered in soap. We tried to call reception to report and get some help, but we’re told ‘turn all the taps on and that should reset it’. This didn’t work so we called back at which point they sent someone from house keeping, who on arrival said ‘I can’t help you’. We gave up, sat for a further 15 mins and had another go. Fortunately some cold water had returned enabling a rinse before dinner. We reported this when back at the house and received a £100 discount on the bill and an offer to move rooms. Having already wasted time and feeling frustrated, we stayed where we were to avoid the hassle of packing and unpacking again. We thought we’d just get up and leave in the morning.
The main house and restaurant are essentially a network of little rooms with a mish mash of chairs - plus the main restaurant. We were early for dinner and thought we’d grab a drink. We struggled to find anywhere to sit and when we did couldn’t to find anyone to serve us as they were all stood around chatting. They forgot to call us for dinner and after 15 mins we had to go and find someone. Sat at the table we were presented with a mostly empty bread basket and no choice, so declined, only to see full baskets with more choice being offered later. It took an hour and a quarter to receive our main course despite pre-ordering 90 mins earlier and we had to pour our own wine. The food was actually very good when it arrived.
Breakfast in the morning wasn’t much better as we sat forgotten waiting for coffee for 20 mins. We complained and were then asked what we had ordered again as it had been put in the bin. The hap hazard service continued as I received two poached eggs that were hard and looked like they’d been on the floor.
On top of this we paid a premium price for two spar treatments on day one. The treatments were actually very good but the-facilities, much like most of the buildings needed a good clean. Staff just stand around despite there being dirty cups and plates in the relaxation room, along with crumbs on the furniture. Towels just littered the place in the changing rooms and by the pool. Garden umbrellas lean against the wall inside, which just says we don’t care about presentation. The food and drinks are really expensive in the Spa and not great quality either. Two sandwiches and one glass of wine for £35.
All in all we felt it was a really poor experience. When we explained our disappointment at check out we were still only offered a miserly £100 off the final bill of nearly £1000. They advertise a luxury, unique experience but the reality couldn’t be further from the truth. Unique in its incompetence maybe.
We had paid the majority upfront when reserving our rooms but we left without paying the final amount in disgust given they weren’t prepared to take our comments and thoughts seriously. The arrogance in dismissing our experience as purely ‘our opinion’ is a further amateur hour outrage. We await a call...

AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!

On arrival at the shop we were told it still wasn’t ready so we waited patiently. After another 10 minutes I insisted on collecting the food. Again told that it wasn’t ready and would we like free drinks while waiting. Absolutely not. At this point I said don’t bother and I wanted a refund. Nobody knew what to do including the manager who made an appearance with our food. Again I declined the food and insisted on a refund. To rub salt in to the wound he said I had to ring a number to get a refund as he didn’t know how to do it!

Starter - Wings in buffalo sauce - dry breaded wings with a 'drizzle' of buffalo sauce, garnished with chive, hmm, not sure about this, if you like American wings like b-dubs this didn't even come close. The cocktails were expensive, poor tasting and very weak. i asked for a cocktail not a fruit juice...

i was certainly holding out for the burger. i ordered 2 - the flamin chicken burger (My wife also ordered this), which was flamin wrong - a whole block of stilton appeared to be smothered on top of the dry crispy chicken; the smell of which made me feel sick - buyers beware...A little tip to the restaurateur's - perhaps put the stilton on the side so you don't ruin the burger for everyone? The second burger, a fairly reasonable gourmet beef burger with bacon and cheddar, caramelised onion, lettuce, pickles in a brioche bun which i would give a 3 out of 5. For desert i ordered a sticky toffee pudding, hoping that my sweet tooth would provide solace. i was given a Cold sticky toffee pudding that stuck to the roof of my mouth forever churning like a cement mixer..come on guys, Chef Mic (rowave) cant even help you here...

Moreover, Already complaining about the copious amounts of Stilton on the burger, a cheque comes to the table, and i see the flamin chicken burger x 2 were still on the bill. One of which had bacon added (£1.50) in addition, did this little piggy run away as i never received the bacon. We again complained and management kindly decided to give us 50% OFF ONE burger after ordering 3 burgers, 3 cocktails, beers and a desert i thought our server was joking. My wife nor I even ate the flamin chicken burger it was so bad, of course as i have decorum i thought lets just pay, get out of here and take to the review sites and wherever else i can to deter people from visiting this establishment.

The pool and facilities are available to hotel and members to use. Although the pools were pretty empty, there were not enough beds to go round and we had to share a bed as did others.
 From arrival to Lunch was 5 hours, which we knew when we booked. On arrival there was a machine upstairs to make your own tea or coffee. We were told snacks were available during the morning but were not. In the end we had to ask and were told only biscuits were available which we gladly accepted. All food and drink is taken in the lounge which is upstairs, so we were up and down several times.
Cream tea was included in our package but was inedible, with the scones being bitter to taste and of a sand like texture. We reported this to reception and were told they would be taken back to the kitchen , we were offered a soft drink as recompense but declined. We aware also told the hotel would be in contact regarding this but they never did.

We couldn’t think of a better way to finish off a lovely seaside visit that proper chippy chips! Well what a disappointment!!
Firstly we were greeted by a very rude man who seemed to see us as an inconvenience (I understand that there is a cafe attached but I feel that you shouldn’t offer take away if you can’t handle it) the poor cashier was lovely but seemed very uncomfortable and aware of the weird atmosphere, we then asked if we could have some smaller/ portions of chips which he seemed confused about and then simply said “no, we can’t halve portions”, weird , its chips, it’s not like we were asking for half of a of fried egg.
Then the chips...... wowee...why on earth would you waste a location like that by chucking some oven chips in oil and hoping for the best. They were rubbery bits of food formerly known as potato, no authenticity at all.

(...and way better than any in the ‘Pig’ chain!),"We stayed at Bailiffscourt to celebrate both my fiancée’s birthday and as an early wedding present. We have two hounds, who travel with us to most places and it was important they joined us for the stay. The hotel could not have been more accommodating, right down to the dog bowls, biscuits and doggie towels that greeted us on arrival at our room in the Gate House.
The Room was wonderfully comfortable with a large four-poster and small Knole style sofa-bed. It also featured a large bathroom with walk-in shower and roll-top bath...it was furnished to a very high standard.
My fiancée had a couple of spa treatments and said the staff were fantastic, and the treatments, excellent. I also used the gym, and as a regular gym user was impressed how well-equipped it was for a hotel facility.
We had dinner in one of the small lounges, understandably, dogs aren’t allowed in the restaurant. However it was incredibly comfortable and we both remarked, that it was like having our own mini private dining room! The staff were outstanding and looked after us superbly. Supper was also wonderful and to a Michelin standard.
Breakfast in the courtyard was also wonderful, the staff again, excellent and they even brought out sausages for the hounds... with whom, it was naturally a huge ‘thumbs-up’!

The grounds and setting of Bailiffscourt is absolutely beautiful and it’s proximity to the beach, a lovely bonus...we had a long walk with our ‘boys’ the next morning...to blow away the cobwebs, before setting off home reflecting on what a truly wonderful experience we had and that we will definitely return!

As a side note, I mention the Pig in the title of this review. They don’t allow dogs which is their choice and may appeal to some people, but I have to say, were quite condescending in pointing that out. I’ve also eaten at several in the Pig chain (the Beach, Forest etc) and Bailiffscourt is in another league from both a culinary and service perspective!

Pros and cons so far- halfway through my break

Pros

Swimming pool - it’s out of this world, rapids, slides, wave machine, rubber ring ride, areas for babies, you name it it’s got it. They allow smallish inflatables, good cafe attached with Costa coffee
Entertainment - loud but of a good quality, take ear plugs for the skyline gang!
Food court dining package - loads of choice and delicious, staff clear tables quickly. Get there as early as possible to avoid queues
Staff - make the kids feel welcome and lots around to ask questions etc

Cons

Arcade - expensive, games are either £1-£3 each not much fun if you have a large family
Outside areas - a little untidy noticeable litter in the day but has gone by the morning, and cleaning crews are visible
Cash machine - charges you for withdrawals, captive audience situation so not fair

Bar staff attentive and friendly

As usual Mine host and partner were typically aloof, unresponsive , unfriendly and showed no interested in their customers
They will not even think to say hello to village locals who have been in their pub many times
Things got worse than the cold atmosphere as the Food served was really awful, yukkkk nasty

Drink selection ok

Even if you consider this as only a local pub it still falls very short of acceptable,

In fact it seems to get worse each time we visit it, the only redeeming point is the garden on a sunny day

It is very obvious that the landlord and partner have no interest in the hospitality industry, they seem to have no interaction with their customers at any point, very strange!!!

SO mr and mrs Landlord “ if you hate this hospitality life then we suggest sell up and move on !!!

The Food really terrible, obviously it was precooked, frozen and then microwaved to within an inch of its life
It was really bland , hot as hell and disgusting , we ordered fish and chips, calves liver and mousaka,
all diners left their dishes ,

It totally ruined our holiday from the first night, with noises into the early morning, all 5 of us were kept up and I personally did get a wink of sleep, I’m so disappointed with butlins ocean hotel, the design of the rooms, corridors, the actual doors and the sound proofing.

We have visited butlins every year for 4 years, the wave hotel is so much better for noise and layout. But this year also saw a huge influx of lower end clientele, unfortunately I would call them chavs, I understand that this isn’t butlins fault, but it’s a fact. These guests are load and anti social, we will be taking our money elsewhere from now on.

The plus side is every single member of staff on that resort is a credit to the organisation, so friendly, so up beat and just fantastic, shame about the room and guests.

The pastries were sparse and didn’t get replenished, the fruit salad consisted of melon and melon, am assuming there was originally other fruits that had been picked out and again not replenished! There were no muffins or bagels and just 2 crumpets which looked stale. The Greek yogurt was in a tiny bowl and ran out before we reached it, by which time we’d lost interest and couldn’t be bothered to ask for more. We’ve had numerous Premier Inn breakfasts over the years and they’ve always been delicious. Not here. What’s happened???",1,3.0,2.0,British,1
482,Magna Tandoori,Food,Bognor, Restaurant,141,Fawlty Towers revisited,"I have found Bognor Regis’s answer to Fawlty Towers, The Magna Tandoori. We have just spent part of our evening watching a gradually unfurling tale of woe.
We’d booked and arrived on time, were shown to our table in a very busy Restaurant and sat watching for quite some time before we had to ask for someone to take our order.
This gave us the opportunity to watch a procession of waiters walking up and down the restaurant, without appearing to notice what was going on.
We were being served by a waiter who seemed to have a wish that he was a million miles away from the restaurant, to say he was surly, rude and couldn’t really care less what was happening to us would be an understatement, he then proceeded to ask the order taker to accept our food order.
A starter devoured, a Prawn Puri, as food goes it scored around 3 out of 10, boring and heat with no spice zing to it. Having used some cutlery a new fork came bouncing across the table with all the grace of a Barnes Wallis bouncing bomb, thrown instead of placed. New plates were treated similarly with no grace at all.
The food, served reasonable quickly considering they were so busy, was quite good, not spectacular, but regular ‘Indian Food’, in good sized portions and reasonably priced.
Behind us continued the melee of people, it was bit like eating in a train station. Trying to pay, after finishing what we wanted to eat, was again moments of delights and leaving our utensils at the finishing positions on our plates, we were passed by at least 6 waiters who looked at our plates and just walked on by, sometimes walking to the other end of the Restaurant and walking back again.
You would have thought the fun would stop there, but they had one last treat for us, the bill was brought, with hot Towels and 2 After Eight mints between 3 people.
So, thank you Magma for such a fun ‘Fawlty Towers’ evening.
Will we be back?
Maybe when Customer satisfaction comes higher on your list, than cramming them in and some of, not all, your waiters realise we are customers. If I want to be treated this way I will go back to Won Kei in London, where the Waiters are expert in the art of giving customer satisfaction by being rude all the time but have perfected this art so well that we enjoy it.",2,2.0,1.0,Indian,1

We were kept waiting to order our meals, and had to go looking for someone to take our order. Prices are quite high ( we were charged £1.20 for soda water and lime - usually about 40p everywhere else). The food, when it arrived, looked ok, but not great. The roast beef was tough, in fact so much was over cooked - the veg was often soggy, whereas the Yorkshire pud was rock hard. The veggie meal included a meat sausage wrapped in bacon. The menu said that extra gravy, potatoes and Yorkshire’s were free with Sunday roast, but we were charged extra for gravy, and the waitress wouldn’t take it off the bill until we pointed to it printed on the menu. Whilst the waitress tried hard, it was clear that the restaurant was running on minimum staff, who seemed young and inexperienced.

Outside the restaurant, the back garden area was really scruffy and strewn with litter. The tables weren’t cleared throughout our entire stay.

Reluctantly a staff member asked if we required a backup heater as only a few were available, this was accepted by me but proved to be inadequate. This condition continued for the whole weekend duration. The heating was also lacking in the attached Premier restaurant so we were unable to enjoy a comfortable evening. Further the bar staff seemed to be pre-occupied causing a delay in service and were very lax although there were few people patronising the bar. Our order of coffee during the evening was undrinkable so with some embarrassment I returned them to the bar staff. I was THEN informed the coffee machines were not working correctly so our money was refunded so we returned to our cold uncomfortable rooms. On leaving I wished to register my complaints however although we waited 10 minutes no member of staff attended the reception desk.

We've been here a couple of times in the past and decided to ""treat"" ourselves. Unfortunately, it wasn't much of a treat. We waited a very long time for our meals - the restaurant was not full but there was one table of 10 being served and I guess that's why we were waiting so long . It must have been 45 minutes before our food arrived (certainly the man at the next table had 2 pints of beer while we we waiting) and I wish we had decided to give up before it did. My cod and chips was fine but mum's grilled plaice was not very well cooked and cold, accompanied by boiling hot rice - maybe in the hope it would warm up the fish. She wasn't able to eat much of it as it didn't taste right and was ""slimy"" in texture. I suppose we should have complained at the time but we didn't get an awful lot of attention from the waiting staff who were obviously busy elsewhere. There seemed to be some regular customers getting much better service than us. It's unlikely we'll visit again but I don't expect they would care! One other problem we had was with toilet accessibility - mum couldn't actually get into one of the cubicles - she is blind and uses a stick and couldn't find a way to wriggle round the door - maybe we missed a disabled access loo as I notice another of your customers brings her mother in a wheelchair.",2,3.0,2.0,Seafood,1

I booked a birthday table online specifically stating it was a birthday (they have a separate page for special occasions), and then called up the restaurant to ensure they understand it’s for a birthday and arrange decorations as promised on the site.

We turned up on Friday, 21st June, and told them we were there for the birthday table. The lady helping us found the booking, asked us who the birthday table was for, and then we handed over the cake to her.

We noticed there were no decorations or anything on the table - just a plain table with your usual menus. We were a bit surprised as we always got decorations and our server at least wishing my son a good birthday at Papa John’s. At least we have a cake, we thought.

Dinner goes fine and service was okay. We waited for about 30 mins for the cake, and finally, fed up, we asked for our cheque. The lady brings the cheque, we pay and she thanks us for visiting.

Confused, we ask her about the cake. She apologises, goes back into the kitchen and comes back with the cake - still in the box and in the plastic bag and leaves it on our table and walks away (with an apology though). It was a surprise, but she just puts the box in front of my son.

Thanks, Pizza Hut, for ruining my son’s birthday. Taught us to stick with Papa John’s - which we ended up doing - we re-did the birthday there the next night. Shame on you Pizza Hut - your brand will not be seeing us visiting again.

Closing this place down would only improve the reputation of the brand name - I hope they do!

We were initially split onto two tables and the lady on the entrance arranged for us to be seated together, meanwhile we were asked to go to ""the bar"" (there was enough room for 2 people to stand). A make shift table was made with us perched on the end. A bottle of wine was eventually offered for this mix up. Unfortunately the evening got no better, the starter was terrible, vegetarian dish consisted of a slither of quiche, the same quiche on the main buffet table, some lettuce leaf with no dressing and 2 slices of a baguette which were marginally larger than a £2 coin and stale. The waiting time after the act and into the main meal was a long time eventually eating at 9 30. There was no organisation to the buffet and quality of food was terrible, it also ran out of a lot of things. Lastly the dessert was served at around 10.20, a slice of cake which none of the 12 people on our table could tell what it was, chocolate apparently.

512,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,5,Terrible behaviour drunken,"I booked the 80’s weekend for myself and two grown up daughters. I understood it would be an adult weekend and that there would be drinking loud music dressing up etc which I thought could be a fun and upbeat weekend centred around live music.
Unfortunately the experience was not positive. We arrived on site at 5:30 ish bearing in mind you cannot access your accommodation till 4pm. There were already people so drunk they were unable to stand and vomiting in the toilets.
The first night the behaviour of people on site made us feel intimidated and unsafe. Large groups of drunk men making lewd comments whenever females passed, which if made in the street could result in arrests under sexual intimidation. Noise levels throughout the night were high, which we expected but At 4am the people in the accommodation above ours were kicking the doors banging slamming and vomiting.
Hours and hours of shouting banging and loud music throughout the day and night, I know I may sound like a boring old whatsit but if it was clear when booking then I wouldn’t have booked it.
The Saturday morning we went out to see if there were any of the other activities on offer eg the pottery painting etc only to be informed that they have to close these on the adult weekends as the “ men get in and smash the place up”
It felt unsafe, a lack of security / Butlins staff except at the bars. Check in offices etc closed so no one to talk to I had to ask in the restaurant how we could check out. They confirmed they had heard there were “some rude, difficult characters “in the area we were staying. i’m Not a prude or of a fragile nature. I feel there is not enough information given when booking as to the expectation you should have. They have a behaviour charter but it seems these do not apply on adult weekends.
It may be the case that our experience is not the norm but it was our experience. Unregulated groups of very drunk people spoiling the experience for others.
Again if you just want an 18-30’s experience and your 30-60 this may be just what you’re looking for ( and why not) but if you just want a fun weekend cantered around the music rather than just how much alcohol can be consumed then maybe not.

We got upgraded to a gold apartment which was great, the beds are un-comfy but other than that an ideal place to stay. If you go self catering be warned fridges are tiny and you wont be able to store loads.

The kids had the best time they loved the shows, the fairground etc and they cant wait to go back. We had the dining menu which was fine and basic meant everyone was fed quickly and at the end of a fun day that's what we needed!

We saw Justin and Paddington show, load of people waited in a queue, we just waited for it to die down and walked in. we were sat at the back but could still see and we didn't waste time waiting around!

The negatives, the red coats...… we did Minehead total tots last year and the red coats were everywhere, getting involved saying hello, before shoes they were there talking to the kids sitting with them etc. The red coats here turned up with 2 mins to spare for the mr men, Teletubbies etc was a real shame that they weren't involved. In all honesty they may well have not been there.

The soft play is great on the first day my 3.5 year old is 99cm you have to be 100cm for the soft play. She was told she couldn't go in, then she went in the little one where there were lots of little kids and obviously peop[le were getting hurt. The next day we went to soft play and she was allowed in. The woman who told us she wasn't allowed in said it was the rules I get that but the little one was so busy with 'little' 1/2 year olds and adults and the main frame was empty, To then be allowed in for the rest of the week some staff need to look at the scenario as opposed to whats in front of them.

If you have young kids go..... they will have a ball we only had access to the old pool but that was great, we will be back to try the new pool but we wont be expecting the 'red coat' experience as they just aren't there at Bognor. If you want the full Butlins experience then Minehead is the way to go.

Shown to table but was able to choose as quiet. Lovely waitress very pleasant and friendly selected seats sat down. Went through the menu and thought we would go for the steak as again not had for a long time in England, this was £20.00 plus. Probably about a 30 minute wait you had to purchase mushrooms and sauce extra. No offer of any vegetables or salad. On plate looked reasonable enough apart from no colour, a few peas would have made all the difference and a grilled tomato. Anyhow we both had ordered steak medium. which to me has always been cooked on outside but still pale pink and juicy in the middle. When we both cut into the meat it was dry and clearly overcooked. it tasted to me ok but to my husband who hates anything chewy he was not pleased. He sat there complaining so I said we need to say something which we did,. Spoke to the really lovely waitress who went back to the kitchen and did offer for 2 more steaks to be cooked but at this stage my husband was rather peeved!! He did think of switching to steak and ale pie and the girl said there no Gravy!! How can you run a restaurant and have no gravy??? Oh and before that when we ordered another drink the girl came up with mine and said they had run out of ICE. Again these are surely the basics how embarrassing for the staff. Needless to say we just paid for our drinks and left quite hungry. Stopped at chippy on the way home. Never looked so smart when eating a chip butty.

The accommodation is atrocious; I don’t expect 5 star accommodation but do expect cleanliness. These silver rooms need demolishing and re-building to a standard which is at least habitable. I walked into a room that had dirty plates in the shower cubical, filthy carpet, the dressing table top had coffee spilt on it, the main table was sticky with some other substance the basin was cracked and looked like it had never been cleaned, mould and dirt with cobwebs everywhere. The towel rails are hanging off the walls, to add to the list we can have wood lice all over the place inside and out, and locks on the doors that anyone can open with a long thin screwdriver, due to a purpose drilled hole next to the lock, see pictures. Let’s hope the new director does the right thing. These rooms are the only thing that let Bognor down, absolute filth.

546,Ocean Hotel & Spa,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,16,Great for a short break,"We came to Butlins Ocean Hotel for a short weekend break with friends. Check in was smooth and Caroline was very thorough going through our welcome pack and letting us know where things were etc. The room was lovely, brightly coloured, clean and fresh with a nice balcony, the towel animals were so sweet. The only minor downside I could find and it really is me being picky is that the kids room had no door on it but that being said, it didn't cause any issues by not being there. The bathroom was clean and functional and the shower was HEAVENLY. We got used to the (I think) water saving feature where the shower goes off intermittently and comes back on again. The main part of the bedroom was nice. Had two chairs and a table and tea/coffee facilities with full sized mugs. Being on the 5th floor we had a great view over the side of the park/Fairground. Breakfast at the Kaleidescope restaurant was again good but very very busy. Staff did a great job of replacing items as they got finished and cleaning and turning round dirty tables for other guests to sit down at. It seemed as though all of the staff in their respective departments were genuinely happy to work at Butlins. The pool was good but very busy. The kids enjoyed the water slides and splash zone.

I have to mention Louis in The Pub & Kitchen which I've reviewed separately, he was brilliant. And also the football coach, I think he had RS on his shirt who coached the kids football was just fantastic. He really engaged with the kids calling them footballers and with the parents as well. The three children in our group who played in the age 5-7 group were absolutely buzzing after they finished playing. Unfortunately due to a long drive back we couldn't get to the Sunday session too.

The only negatives we encountered really were that the fairground closes at 5 which we thought was quite early and that the pool changing rooms were filthy. The staff were doing their absolute best but Butlins should enforce a rule where people need to remove their outdoor shoes before entering the changing rooms as the dirt from the shoes mixed with water was gross. Not to mention the hair and fluff and whatever else was on the floor. Also, the hotel lifts must have a mention, they were soul destroyingly slow. We also got stuck for a few minutes in one on Saturday evening.

All in all a hugely successful, enjoyable and tiring weekend for all involved. Thanks Butlins!",5,3.0,2.0,0,0

550,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,20,Wedding Anniversary ,"On arrival my husband and I noticed the building looked grubby. We had been a few times previously so could see the differences. The reception couldn’t find our booking so was asked to take a seat. There was cobwebs over the lighting, so first impressions were not good. As we waited more than 40 minutes the room the amount of people complaining was astounding. Keys didn’t work, windows stuck, rooms too hot. One member of staff Esme was bossing the trainee around as she was trying to deal with us, instead of going around the reception desk herself. Also leaning over the desk, as she once again couldn’t be bothered to walk around it so I got an eyeful of her underwear as her dress was so short. Then proceeded to to hum to herself while everyone stood around annoyed.

The room was far from deluxe, basic and in need of some attention. The window wouldn’t stay open as the frame was rotten and there was a window pane missing which was covered up with plastic and cellotape. No air con so the room was scorching. They provided a huge extremely noisy fan which just blew warm air around as the window wouldn’t stay open. Just awful.

The lounge area had several lightbulbs out but was nice to sit in. The garden was lovely for eventing drinks.

The restaurant is our favourite part of this hotel. The food was lovely and the restaurant staff were well trained. Although service was a little slow but as it’s so lovely in the we didn’t mind waiting.

So that will be our final visit to this hotel. As there are our superior to this for the same money.

I went for lunch today (Thursday 3rd Jan). Being fully aware and accepting of the ""round table"" policy, I made a polite enquiry regarding it being acceptable to sit there as we were a table of two. I was assured by the waitress that it was fine. After a few minutes perusing menus and having ordered our drinks we were asked (by a different ""waitress"") to move to the ""long shared table"" as a party of three had arrived .I politely suggested that there was evidently room for three at the long shared table (albeit involved requesting someone move along a seat at the ""shared long table"") and that it was not reasonable to ask us to move. The ""waitress"" (whom I now believe to be... is apparently the owners wife) then made a sarcastic confrontational comment about my lack of co-operation, and re-iterated the policy in ear shot of all... (which I had previously confirmed with staff was OK). While this was going on, my guest moved us both to the end of the long table as it had been kindly and pro-actively vacated by another couple... the same ""owner's wife"" lady then proceeded to snatch away our drinks and menus and announced that she was refusing to serve us and wanted us to leave... simultaneously shouting across the crowded restaurant that ""I had been rude to her on several previous occasions""... never having to my knowledge met or spoken with this lady before this was both unbecoming and untrue. I objected to this treatment and questioned her observations and commitment to the hospitality industry, maintaining at all time a civil tongue. She then decided to suggest inviting her husband downstairs to which I agreed. Her husband was not prepared to entertain any explanation from me and asked me to leave which I immediately agreed to do. He stated that ""he knew his wife well enough"".... of that I have no doubt. Maybe she would be better suited to an alternative role away from FOH. Very upset, and truly very concerned for her level of stress/anger/honesty, and now reluctantly unwilling to return if that customer service is considered policy.
Based on other reviews and the untruthful allegations made on the day, I fully expect this to be treated as an inaccurate account, however why would I? I can assure you this is 100% to the best of my recollection. I am very upset. Possibly she mistook me for someone else? - if that is an excuse? I loved eating in your restaurant. Feedback is a gift.

New pool would of been good fun if it wasn’t crammed with people, too busy waiting times on most the slides/flumes was between 20-40 waiting time, you couldn’t move without bumping into someone which with baby’s is dangerous. Also only saw one life guard around the hole pool other than the ones on the slides. They should have a max capacity or something as it was just so busy. The floors in the changing room were filthy with mud , clumps of hair and god knows what else. Around the resort wasn’t enough for toddlers. My child was just shy in heigh of almost every ride etc so was really disappointed in that. Only thing my child could to was play in the park or indoor soft play but as I’ve said before it’s just to busy. Not enough for adults to do either. We took ourselves out of the resort 2 out of 4 days as was too busy and not enough to do. Also much better mini golf and ice cream parlour outside the resort! Restaurants are ok but nothing special.

567,WWT Wetland,Attractions,Arundel,Nature/Gardens,50,Disappointing half term activity,"We visited in the February half term lured in by the ‘puddle jumping championship’ which sounded ideal for my young children who are obsessed with muddly puddles. What we found was a large, unorganised queue of families and a plastic tray with an inch of water in it. After waiting 15 minutes the children were allowed 1 jump in the plastic tray then scored out of 100 and given a sticker. The staff were trying to make it a bit more exciting but this wasn’t really possible given the circumstances. We had high hopes of a puddle assault course where children could play and splash freely rather than regimented queuing for 1 jump. Not worth wrestling them into the puddlesuit for. There was, however, a much larger natural puddle just round the corner which they enjoyed far more. This ‘event’ needs a rethink.

568,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,98,Tots week,"Just got back from our 2nd tots week at Butlins Bognor Regis, my little boy (3 years old) and myself had a great time, we arrived and checked in, went to check out the room and it was just a room with a double bed and a bathroom with the shower door hanging off so went to reception nd the lovely lady I dealt with was so helpful and they moved us to a 2 bed place, it was lovely, could do with a mini fridge in these places as standard as I had to buy milk every night for my little one but apparently you can hire them quite cheap

The entertainment was great, all the shows we saw were brilliant, especially milkshake live and skyline gang farewell show

There was so much for my little one to do, with an awesome newly built swimming pool/splash park, arcades, soft play, archery, balance bikes, football, fairground rides and much, much more

Massive shout out to Harley (Softplay Simon, my little boy calls him) one of the guys who works on the fairground/soft play my little boy really took to him when we came in March and didn't stop talking about him all the way upto this time round, so he was very happy to see him again. (See photo)

The ocean drive food place has a wide variety of food on offer and is always great

The range of classes is poor for the membership price, the only thing I like about the classes is that the instructors are great. In the gym, the hand towel dispensers are constantly empty and so is the hand soap in the toilets. I don’t think that there is a great range of machines in the gym and some of them break repeatedly and obviously need replacing.I think that for the price of the membership I would expect more facilities, more classes, for broken things to be properly fixed or replaced, for more refurbishments to be made and at the very least for everything to be cleaner and hand towels refilled. I often see members of staff cleaning machines in the gym but ignoring that all the dispensers are empty.The thing that really pushed me into writing a negative review is that this week the centre has been constantly been smelling overwhelmingly like people’s private parts!

I admitted doing it and said I would go and say sorry after the quiz had ended and I had finished eating.

583,Arundel Castle,Attractions,Arundel,Historical/Culture,46,Amazing but pricy,"Arundel is a charming intact Castle and worth a visit. It has centuries of history to read and hear about and wonderful castle grounds. We have been before and have been inside - numerous rooms lavishly decorated - but on this occasion we only obtained access to the garden. Whilst the gardens are amazing and well worth visiting the price for entry for three paying people and one child was more than we expected. Worth checking before you go to make sure you get the best deals. There is so much to see that it is worth spending the whole day there. I would suggest buying the tickets that allow you to access both the grounds and the interior as I feel that would make it more worthwhile. The local village is great and there is an Italian restaurant (La Compania) that serves excellent vegan food cooked by vegans! We did not sample the food at the castle so cannot comment on that. There are long walks involved - but if you need them there are electric vehicles that can move you around. But expect to do a considerable amount of walking even then - it is huge! There is a good local car park near the entrance.

593,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,11,Mixed review,"We visited during a “just for tots week” and had a good time, my son is 3 and had a great time. There is good and bad to this review however the good outweighed the bad and by no means ruined our visit. We came a few months back on a day visit and my son loved it so decided to come for the 5 day trip (not really 5 days) can’t check in until 3 and need to check out by 10, but you are able to use the park before and after, we also got a great price on the room. Check in was easy with helpful and friendly staff, we had been given a slight upgrade from a 2 bed to 3 bed, while we didn’t need the extra room it was handy for storage. (Trolleys are also provided to get your luggage from car to room as it’s a bit of a trek)
The apartment was a great size and almost everything you could need was provided, (but here comes the bad)
Before I talk about the apartment I just want to say that I know the cleaners are under a lot of pressure but it’s not what I would expect from a place like Butlins.
The kitchen was filthy with crusty food left on the kitchen tops, the oven hob is also in need of some attention (maintenance wise) it smelt greasy and everything from cupboards to handles had old grease on.
Even after giving the kitchen a clean the grease was still present.
Has a working fridge/freezer and tea coffee provided.
The bathroom was also dirty (not as bad) but we had to clean it.
(I’m not a snob and have stayed in some right dives over the years and if I was on my own I wouldn’t be bothered, but this was a family break and feel things should be of better standard)
It had rained quite heavily at times during our stay and the apartment had a constant damp smell to it and in places you could see walls were wet, this probably being condensation rather than leaks. We would also find our clothes felt damp.
We tried to battle this with open windows and heaters on, however the heaters do work but are in serious need of replacement.
With that being said it is just a room and we spent minimal time in it as I said previous by no means ruined our stay.
Other than that everything else is great, plenty of restaurants form pizza, chippy and pub grub all reasonably priced and the food was pretty good. A few outdoor parks for the kids and of course the amusements. Butlins puts plenty on for the kids, play dough, arts and crafts, tiny tikes cars and so on your always find something to do. You can also do a few paid activities such as football, cross bow and bikes but we didn’t do this.
The shows are good with 3 stages showing different things throughout the day but some things are repeated. (Mr Men, Telletubbies, Skyline crew and more. My only gripe with this is that some of the bigger shows clashed but I guess they need to fit it all in.
Almost forgot to mention the whole point in us coming was a show from Justin Fletcher, it was pretty good, would have liked a few more characters rather than all the signing but still decent.
The Paddington Bear show was great and I think I my son enjoyed that even more and would say it’s a must see.
All in all we had a good time, for the price you can’t complain and my son had a great time you will always have plenty to do with your little ones be it the funfair (VERY strict on child’s heights) trampolines, Helter skelter, bumper cars or go carts (cost £6 per car) inside also has some younger kids rides, a huge soft play again very strict on heights but a smaller area for kids who aren’t quite tall enough. (They also stop the older kids, height dependent going on so your little ones don’t get wiped out) also a small new animal room with snakes, spiders etc that has an occasional talk and you get to hold/pet some of the creatures.
Staff are great friendly and helpful the redcoats go out there way to make sure you enjoy the shows.
Will say the character meet and great on last morning is a little rushed.
A few extra things there that I’m not gonna go into detail.
Burger King, gift shop, bars, coffee/snack bar, face painting, temp tattoos, wax hand models, scoops ice cream(a must) toy shop and supermarket (well overpriced)
I’m not sure if we’d stay again but will definitely return for a day visit.
Sorry for long review, hope people find it helpful.

595,Mamma Mia,Food,Bognor, Restaurant,12,"Poor service, BIG ""let down"" ","It was meant to be a ruby wedding anniversary celebration with friends, but ended up being a bitter disappointment following the worst service we have experienced. I made the booking weeks ago and followed it up with a visit to the restaurant two days before. My friend is partially sited so I wanted to ensure we had the table by the window where it was bright.

When we arrived, the table I requested was occupied. We were asked to sit in the middle of the room where it was dark and noisy to wait for the table to become available (why were they not sat at this table in the first place was beyond me?) The waitress came over to take our drink order, we were never asked at any point later in the evening if we would like another....We then ordered our starters and mains at the same time. Food was okay, not overly special, we have all ate far better Italian dishes elsewhere. My meal in particular was warm, not hot, so I found myself eating it quickly before it turned cold. The table was cleared and the dessert menu offered and that's where it ended. We were totally forgotten about. Part of the reason for choosing Mamma Mia was to try the homemade lemon cheesecake as this came highly recommended. We were going to order 4, at just under £20 so fairly highly priced. We waited... and we waited ... To add further insult a very large party of 20+ descended on the restaurant and the staff rallied round like they were celebrities. This was the final straw. I consider it unacceptable to wait in excess for half hour to take a dessert order, who knows how much longer we would have waited had we not requested the bill and left? Disappointed. Will neither return or recommend.

The room was wonderful; clean and spacious with high end toiletries in the en-suite. The bed was extremely comfortable.
The dinner was amazing. My husband had steak and lobster, he said it was the best he’s ever had. I had cod on a bed of chorizo mashed potato with mushrooms and sautéed Swiss chard. It was delicious.

There was so much to do throughout the day to keep a 8 year old entertained, you had to pay extra for some activities which I don't think is fair, also the B line is extra money which is also not fair, people were going mad when the Stephen mulhern show was on, pushing people, running it was not safe when we were carrying children and old people being pushed, they should allocate seats and not make it a free for all, also the new water park changing rooms are right near the front door so you get freezing wind coming through in to the changing rooms when you get out of the pool, the price of drinks is a bit much nearly 5 quid for a pint of beer, so the bar Rosso was never busy really. We enjoyed our break there even though it was busy you could still walk around and not feel too crowded. Hopefully this feedback could make Butlins improve on a few things.

We had booked a table to 16:00, but arrived 15 minutes early. We were shown to our table at about 15:50 and given the menus to read.

After 35 minutes the kids were getting restless so I grabbed the next waitress to go past and asked what I needed to do to get server.

She said they were very busy and apologised after explaining she was the only person looking after the area. She asked if we had ordered drinks. As we hadn’t we gave her the drinks order which turned up one short after 15 mins.

We asked to see the allergy menu and were told that the manager would have to serve us and she’d as him to come over. 10 minutes later he comes over and asks us what we would like to eat. We asked for the allergy menu and after that was sorted we have him our order to be told that the roast dinners were all sold out. That’s the first we’d heard of that after need at the table for over an hour.

We placed our order and waiting over 40 mins for that to arrive.

My wife’s steak which was supposed to be medium to well done was cremated and dry, my sones steak as part of his grill was supposed to be rare to medium and was well done, his chicken was cremated. His wife’s cheese burger was burnt and dry. My pie was had rock hard pastry and over cooked vegetables. The peas were a funny green and tasteless as if they’d bee cooked for a long time.

All in all a disaster for my wife’s birthday.

I collared the manager and explained about the food, he apologies and said he wouldn’t charge us anything, but the damage was done.

We ate what we could and left as soon as we could.

This is the second really poor mean we’ve had at this beefeaters, so I cannot see us going back.

616,Moathouse Café,Food,Arundel, Café,2,Poor customer service ,"I visited today as part of an overnight stay, my first in Arundel. I ordered 2 breakfasts anad 2 drinks aware that town centre parking was only for 1 hour. Forty minutes later, I approached the counter to say I was just about to move my van as my breakfast had not been served. I was only going to move it, my wife was going to remain in the cafe. I was told that the breakfast was just being put on the plate now. I explained that it still wasn't on the plate, and brought out therefore I needed to move my van as I would not have time to eat it within the hour. With that I was told just pay for your drinks which is not the response you want when asking for a slight delay while you just love a car.
What I wasn't aware of was that while I was at the counter a girl took the roast to my wife and asked what the problem was. When my wife told her, she explained that the wait for food is 30 minutes, something we weren't told, plus it was over that.

617,Mr P's Classic Amusements,Attractions,Bognor,Amusements/Fun,8,A lot of room for improvement,"I write my review based on visiting all of the Mr P arcades. I will not waffle on but here is the basics.

For starters, not all of the machines are on their best payout percentages. Their website claims they have the best percentage payouts, this may be true in comparison to other amusements but losing £1000 through a £70 jackpot machine is definitely not 90%.

Any machine player will generally know if a machine is worth playing. A sign for this is “being full up”. Mr P arcades refill their machines and I have experienced this personally many times in each branch. For example, a party time could be full, the coins are dropping, you win £50 collect it and only pays £19 before going empty, then they refill or flick the hopper top up switch after only refloating £31. The next player then thinks it’s full up but does his balls in.

The arcade opening times are very early to close, however, if you are a promoter of their business via youtube, they will stay open till all hours for you, but not to normal customers.

The owners will lend people money who they get on well with, but others they will not, not very professional.

The staff will empty machines whilst you go for a fag or to the bank.

The arcades never ever have enough pound coins in, staff always have to empty machines half way through playing to get coins.

No loyalty rewards given, where as other arcades you get some kind of rewards. However you do get some free play each visit, on certain machines.

Often machines spend weeks out of use because the owners do not drive. The staff on site do not generally know how to fix the machines when they malfunction.

The air conditioning is pretty much non existent in all 3 arcades. It’s very hot in summer and stuffy most days.

You may get refreshments but that has been abused so seems to be cut back a bit.

All in all, the machines are there for “nostalgia” and certainly as with any arcades you cannot “make money” from, it’s all entertainment. You can get lucky, or you can be very unlucky.

The reason for my low score is that the brand continues to maintain they are this that and the other but in fact they are not. I’ve seen various lies, various untoward behaviour, very unfair ethics. All customers should be treated the same, whoever they are. Opening and closing should be set. Filming of other arcade users without their permission should not be allowed. They will write essays on their social media to portray they are amazing people, which some fall for, but let’s face it - they are only in it for the money in reality, nobody starts a business just for the love, otherwise they would be skint in no time.",2,4.0,0.0,0,1

We were disappointed with our accomodation, with outlook over the bins, cars driving at us as the hotel window was at the end of the slip road to the car park. There was very little reception could do as the hotel was full so we had to put up with it and spend the weekend with the curtains closed and make the most of it. Televisions did not work apparently something to do with atmospherics and was site wide (so we were told) other than that everything was fine. Swimming pool was exceptional slides, Rapids, flumes. Lots for the little ones too. Changing rooms and lockers were plentiful- larger ones incorporated pull down changing tables and a safe place for the little ones while you got dressed. As you where your footwear to the changing rooms could do with more cleaners to keep the floors clean.
Entertainment was exceptional Stephen Mulhern, Panto, Paddington show were great we bought the B line fast passes and was pleased we did otherwise alot of queuing.
Food was good, we went for dine around vouchers as part of the dining plan and could eat at any restaurant two courses and have breakfast in the hotel. Really easy to use and meant all our food was paid for in advance. Would do this again.
 So much to do despite disappointment with our room, still was a lovely break with extra special memories.

Went again recently (April 2019) and booked a particular table. When we arrived restaurant was almost empty except (predictably) the table we had booked. So we took another table. Then had to get up and find menus for my guests and call for a waitress to take an order for drinks. The disinterest was palpable. To be fair a young male waiter later in the meal was excellent. Food when it eventually arrived was amongst the worst I have had for some time. The bill for four of us including two courses each, two glasses of wine and a pint of beer between us

There is a good dining room with lots of tables and chairs and a decent lounge too with lots of comfy chairs and also a TV. We had an en suite room for 4 but we had booked it for two of us. There was lots of storage space for our things and it would have been fine for 4 people too. The shower was good with plenty of hot water. The staff are very friendly and helpful and we had good advice about places to eat from Carol. We put our bikes in the bike shed around the back which was securely locked. The train service along the coast in both directions is very good and I think there were good buses too but we didn't use those. You can certainly get around well by public transport along the coast.

651,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,7,Mixed Feelings on Butlins,"We spent a four night break. First the good points, we are exhausted on our return! The days were busy, booked a few activities, splash pool was great, we went everyday. Funfair good, evening shows, circus good. Would recommend going early to the pool as it gets extremely packed and queues for rides can be 50 mins wait. Also the changing room gets very dirty after 11am!

Bad points, cleanliness of apartment awful. Kitchen cupboards dirty, utensils had food on them probably from last guests, kitchen floor sticky, dustpan and broom filthy with dirt and hair. I had to buy my own at local supermarket. Bathroom radiators so dusty, had to wipe down before putting our towels on them. Kids would not sit on the carpet after seeing dirt underneath sofa, no furniture moved for hoovering. It was a new style silver, but though it looked modern, look closer and things have not been maintained or cleaned so have built up dirt. Bring your own pots, pans,
and cutlery ones provided were old and beaten up. Considering we were a family of five, they only gave us cutlery for four.
The entertainment venues also need a good cleaning, floors were sticky and ventilation was awful, no air, horrible stale smell in Centre Stage and Reds venue. They need to clean in between shows, if you go to a later show you have to sit amongst, rubbish, spilt drinks, sticky floors from previous show. The arcades are a waste of money, kids go crazy trying to get as many tickets as possible, you will trade them in for rubbish. Will not be going back to Butlins, definitely not Bognor. Maybe the cleaning in the hotel rooms might be better, but cleaning should be to a certain standard in all accomodation, no matter what level.

The place has had a massive overhaul, our apartment was sparkling - new carpets, new windows, heating that worked! The only niggle was that lots of food outlets were shut or had very odd opening hours. I've never seen a Burger King closed when people were around who wanted to spend money. Papa John's, whilst having gorgeous, heppy, helpful staff, wasn't great as far as the pizza went. I like pizza base a lot, I'd like it better if the toppings they put on it had been bigger than a sparrow's breakfast; really stingy and no flavour. What do they do to them? I made a mental note to avoid there next time - I made a mental note to avoid it this time too but I forgot. That aside, it was a great weekend and Butlin's staff were a delight. We spent a simlar weekend in Pontin's at Prestatyn a few years ago and that was a bit like a short stay in a badly run refugee camp, so top marks to Butlin's for excellent staff training and for employing human beings and not angry gorillas.

When we were eating they kept coming and taking bowls away and didn’t ask how the food was. I hadn’t finished and they tried to clear the table.
It used to be a lovely experience with a smile going here but I’d avoid because there’s so many better places for service. It was always busy and tonight was dead.
They then asked if we wanted to tip and kept watching us? Who does that",2,3.0,0.0,Indian,1
667,Travelodge Fontwell,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,6,Great place to commute from,"Well it didn't have a brilliant start I can tell you. After choosing where we wanted to go for a few days I chose this hotel for our stay as the rate for the first night (Sunday) was so reasonable and ideally placed, thats when it all went pear-shape. I tried the app on my mobile first, couldn't book.Then the website couldn't book. My husband and I decided to just turn up and 'see what happens'. Well when we arrived a lovely lady (Dulce) greeted us and after explaining the problem put the wheels in motion and within minute we were booked in and in our nice clean room. It appeared that it was a problem with the website itself so I'm glad we just turned up as we had 2 lovely sunny days in Arundel.
This hotel and its sister hotel are within walking distance of a really nice pub The Old Stables and the Fontwell Park Racecourse.

I was touched that the owner had remembered me and gave me a free beer, as he used to do sometimes in the past, however there were two beers on the bill at the end.
We ordered onion bajhi and chotpoti for starters .These were quite ok.
I ordered Chicken Moglhai and my wife ordered butter duck.
When the food arrived, it seemed my wife's butter duck was actually duck korma (not even remotely similar) and my moglhai seemed the almost same sauce. Both dishes were unbearably sweet so we could only manage to eat about 1/2 each before giving up.
Not wishing to make a fuss we just paid the bill & left disappointed. I was more disappointed with the owner's loss of enthusiasm for his restaurant that the food. He used to be such a lovely, friendly guy but now he seems to be walking around like royalty looking down on everyone.

Park in great condition, like the large open green spaces where the kids can play football and chill.

Can’t fault it, staff really friendly as always. Nice big bar and clubhouse, plus an adults only bar. Arcade is an arcade, does the job well.

Swimming pool really good, busy but very clean. Plus the outdoor pool was a great holiday experience for my little one.

Slight moan... the adults hour on the pool can make things difficult when planning a day, pool only open 9-5 and adults until 10. Found this surprising in a park focused on children. Plus the changing rooms could do with some cubicles!

683,Fino,Food,Bognor, Restaurant,2,"Nice location, ambiance and service, acceptable food.","So 4 of use ate at Finos recently. We had the seafood platter to share for starters, and a crab bruschetta starter. For mains we had the crab risotto, a pizza, and the breaded chicken, with egg and chips. Desert just had one chocolate tart with the mascapone. Came to around 100 pounds with drinks.

Restaurant was really nice and clean, nice lighting and general ambiance. Toilets nice and clean and modern. Staff were friendly and nice. Trying to do a fair honest review so its actually meaningful and constructive.

Drinks order was done reasonably quickly. Took a perhaps a while to place our food order, not long enough that it was bad, but just a bit too long. After order was made food came out in good time, with about the right gap between starter and main.

Starter. The seafood platter, tasted reasonably good. Breaded whitebait, and calamari in a bowl with some tartar style source. It was ok. decent. the seafood perhaps lacked the wow factor, but it was not bad. tasted reasonably fresh. just needed perhaps some more flavours or choice of dips. the crab bruschetta. Was a bit disapointing. Again not really bad. But the bread (panninni or something) was just a bit soft and tasteless, the crab layer didnt really have much flavour, it was just a bit bland. Not like really tasty, hard to describe. but not bad. not unpleasent.

The mains. The pizza which was just cheese and tomato. The quality of the pizza base was nice, and sort of seemed like good fresh dough. the cheese and tomato sauce had a good fresh flavor. but it lacked real flavor beyond just tomato and cheese was generally a bit bland (not a major problem for the kids menu). Also the bottem of the pizza had little black bits on it. the base was not burnt, but it had little black bits from where it sat in the oven, and these sort of gave a strong bitter charcoal flavor which was the overwhelming taste.

The crab risotto. This looked good, the texture of the risotto was good. But it had a really strong, overpowering flavor of aniseed? or something like this, maybe fennel. First spoon you notice it and you can not really taste anything else. But it became a bit sickly quickly. Again its was not really bad. but it was not great.

The Bread crumb chicken with a fried egg on top and chips. The chicken tasted fresh, the bread crumbs were fresh, it was hand made. It was not dry. the bread crumbs where a little bit greasy. and theres was no other real flavour going on apart from the chicken. but I thought it was pretty good. Fried egg on top. Fine. chips were good too. It just felt a bit like the sort of thing I make at home, tasty but a bit bland perhaps. I also thought the truffle source was properly vile, so glad it was in a little jar on its own it would have ruined the meal. but everyone else thought it was delicious and stole it :) thats a personal taste thing i think.

Desert. The chochlate tarte with mascapone, with little chocholate sticks in it. the flavour was great. the nice creamy mascapone, with sweet chocolate sticks. However the chocolate tart was bullet hard, I literally could not break it with a ton of force, it was so tough and when it broke it would shatter and fly off the plate. perhaps needed more balance was a lot of mascapone with just a very thin tart. but it tasted really nice.

Thats it. Im trying to be really honest. Would we go back. Yes. I think the restaurant has good intentions and is trying to serve good food and it felt nice in there, and we had a good time. The food was hmm.. It was ""ok"" better than average restaurants in the area. But there were big flaws with the food. Proper ""foodies"" would have been upset by some of these mistakes.

My main course was nothing special but the other main course of sausage & mash consisted of 2 small sausages on top of mash and nothing else not even veg!

685,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,475,Fantastic young family summer holiday - lots to do!,"As a family of 4 we travelled from Scotland to come here (especially for the weather) On arrival we were greeted by the receptionist in Shoreline Hotel. Heres a few points:
Room - amazing for kids! The decor is a fab sailor theme with lots of storage, kids bunk beds with disco lights, an interactive TV, main bedroom had kettle with teas/coffees/small fridge, large comfy bed, fresh towels, spotlessly clean, seating areas with sofa, table and large windows. Bathroom again large with bath and powerful shower, toiletries provided. Housekeeping regularly and made towels into different characters which kids loved. A plan of the weeks activities was in our room making planning easy. Also a kids play area of a ship wheel and activities on the wall. Safe room with secure doors and glass balcony. Iron and iron board and small safe included.
Hotel restaurant - we had the meal deal of breakfast and dinner and we are glad we did. We didnt expect much from a buffet dinner but the staff were brilliant at keeping it clean and organised. Food always hot, so much to choose from and a cook always came out to see me as i have a gluten free diet and they catered amazing for this, personally showing me around what I could eat each day. Kids corner, fresh hot food and ice cream factory always a hit.
Swimming pool - amazing! Kids had the best time here, plnety of changing rooms all catered for families, the pool area always clean and well staffed with lifeguards. The kids loved the wave machine, outdoor rapids and slides the best. Although the slides are for under 18's only.
Beach - the beach next to the resort you have to walk to the other end of the resort to get through the gate, the beach is stoney but kids enjoyed paddling.
Fairground - on site fair rides all free and unlimited is amazing, kids loved this and the fun mirror room. Staff very friendly and helpful.
Activities - alot of them you have to book on arrival and pay a small fee. My daughter did the adventure ropes for £12 and loved it, she went around about 3 times. My son did the free archery in the morning. Also book the character breakfast which is free for young kids as they had a ball dancing, using instruments and joining the parade.
Indoor - lots to do indoor from hundreds of arcades, more free unlimited rides, free softplay, puppet shows and animal handling. My kids loved seeing the snakes and getting to hold a chameleon.
Shows and meet and greets - we found it hard to do them all so we picked our favs. We watched Diversity, padding bear, Ben Hanlin, teletubbies etc which are all fantastic, you cannot fault these. They are some of the highlights from our holiday and things you wouldnt get anywhere else, especially included in your holiday price. My kids met a few characters and had their photo.
Evening entertainment - Again there is entertainment in many of their stages so plenty to choose from to suit you and your family. Some of our best was the wrestling, talent show, summer festival and the animal man.
Grounds - are kept nice and clean, plenty of restaurants, shops and cafes and really good prices. I thought it would be expensive but we got a sandwich from the shops for £1 at lunch. A few play parks and quiet seating spots. There is always someone about like a moving piano with a man singing, a man with wild falcons for kids to see and much more.

It is impossible to be bored here. We had the best time. The staff are brilliant with kids, food great quality, reasonable prices everywhere and beautiful hotel. Some of the best entertainment. Our kids cannot wait to go back!

686,Parsons Table,Food,Arundel, Restaurant,39,"A real gem, superb","My wife and I and four friends met for lunch today. Our first visit to the Parsons Table in Arundel.

The warm welcome, super ambience and attentive, friendly staff were matched by outstanding food both in taste and presentation. All three courses were in our opinion fantastic and for fine dining, good value.

The menu is not huge thankfully but offers a very tempting and varied selection of fish, meat and vegetarian dishes based upon fresh, high quality local ingredients thoughtfully prepared and presented. There are also daily starter and mains specials which some of us tried and which were found to be excellent.

For starters, between us we tried the chestnut mushroom veloute, the warm mackerel and the roasted beetroot specials. For mains we had the South Coast cod with risotto special, the South Coast Hake and the Seafood Medley special. All were outstanding in freshness and quality of the ingredients, presentation and taste.

We finished with the dark chocolate and orange bar, vanilla and mascarpone cheese cake and the warm treacle tart. Fitting finales to a great meal.

The portion sizes are well judged, not overpoweringly large but not the disappointingly small nouvelle cuisine portions that you sometimes get and begrudge.

The wine list was very good and sensibly priced. We tried the Picpoul de Pinet which was a good accompaniment to the fish dishes.

I should also mention the excellent gins and tonic we had as an aperitif. The gin was local (Chilgrove) distilled based upon grape alcohol and served with orange zest.

It was a very good experience indeed and one that we will repeat. Great to find such a gem run by a couple who clearly care about food and customer experience and who have very good staff.

687,World's End,Food,Arundel, Pub/Bar,459,Rubbish roast! Expensive rubbish too.,"If you look at the menu here it seems the manager has ideas above his station, and above the capabilities of the cook as well! Far too many items on the menu, so hardly surprising they're poorly executed. Prawn cocktail with peppers and celery in it to bulk it out, ewww, probably why they think they can charge ridiculous prices, just for being pretentious.

The roast beef lunch wasn't worth £5 (it was nearly £15). The meat was OK but it certainly didn't melt in the mouth, took a fair bit of knife work to cut up unfortunately. The gravy was bland, tasted like dishwater. The roast potatoes were advertised as being in beef dripping, they definitely weren't! I do roast potatoes in beef dripping every time I cook a roast, they crisp up nicely and have great flavour, these potatoes were really bland and tasteless, not even seasoned.

The Yorkshire pudding was OK, but tasted strangely sweet, like it was cooked using honey (would have been great for a dessert with ice cream and maple syrup topping but) not great with a savoury roast. Worst of all were the vegetables! I like mine Al dente, these were practically raw! Seems like they were heated up in boiling water but then served before they were cooked. No horseradish or mustard offered at any point.

As I popped to the ladies loo I couldn't but help notice a lot of plates which had contained roast dinners were left on tables with lots of veg still on them. Shame none of the waiting staff mentioned the undercooked veg to the cook.

We received 2 check backs within a minute of each other, both less than 2 minutes before we finished trying to eat our food, so certainly not worth wasting time pointing out how awful the food was.

The cook obviously doesn't taste what he/she serves to customers, pretty sure if the food was tasted anyone worth their salt wouldn't have the nerve to hand it to customers and actually charge for it. I wouldn't eat here again if it was free! I value my taste buds and stomach.

Looks good from the outside but definitely a place to keep driving past!

I can't understand why this place was so busy, with such a poorly executed roast lunch and expensive dishes on the menu this place had no redeeming features at all. Pretty place but lots of unhygienic dusty hops hanging in the rooms, over dining tables too, yuck.",1,3.0,2.0,British,1

Completely rare. I sent it back and had to wait for a replacement meal. In the meantime my son ate his meal on his own. When I got my meal the steak was cooked ok. I peeled my prawns and took a bite. As I did so I looked down and realised that they were completely raw in the middle!!! I spat out what I had. By then I'd had enough. Appetite killed. When we received the bill we were told that they hadn't charged for my meal. I thought well seeing as I hadn't eaten anything damn right.

695,Domino's Pizza,Food,Littlehampton, Fast Food/Takeaway,168,Poor Customer Service & Liars ,"I pre-ordered via the Domino’s app 1hour15 minutes before delivery time. All was in order, the app displayed the pizza was in the oven and then out for delivery. I tracked the order, the driver was supposed to be outside. I went outside, no delivery driver. I waited ten minutes, checked the app again “your pizza has arrived / enjoy your food”. I called the branch. ‘The driver is in reception waiting for you, he’s tried to call but there’s been no answer’. I explained that my phone hadn’t rung, nor was I staying in a hotel with a reception. I was however in a holiday cottage and the address came up on the app when I put in the postcode. The store said they’d have our order with me shortly. I said that I didn’t want the order that had already been sent as it’d be stone cold. Good enough the store said they would cook fresh and re-send. An hour on from my preferred delivery time I called the branch again and spoke to someone else this time. The guy said the order was on its way. How long I asked as I had already been waiting almost an hour on from the original delivery time. The response was vague. I asked if they would take some money off our order due to the mess around. The guy on the phone put me on hold to check with his manager. After a VERY short wait, I was told no, because the driver tried to call me and there was no answer, they’d be no discount. The so called attempt to contact me was a blatant lie. My phone had a signal and maintained such for the two occasions I spoke to the branch. The order arrived a few minutes after the call. I was keen to send it back without payment, my husband however, decided to accept it and pay for it, with a tip! The driver that brought the redelivery said his colleague messed up, went to the wrong address and he knew our location as he’d delivered there before. The food was barely hot, thankfully I had the oven ticking over for an hour (just in case) so warmed it to an edible temperature.

I would also like to add that the branch was just over two miles away so it wasn’t as if we were in the back of beyond. Appalling customer service. I wouldn’t order from here again if you paid ME.

Thankfully my local branch of Domino’s is super reliable. Littlehampton could learn a thing or two from them and from your competitor; Pizza Hut for that matter, even they have a Speed Guarantee.

When we went back inside to get something else I remarked on the odd taste and was told they had forgotten the gin!! It was slightly amusing and they were honest enough to explain . We went to our table and there was a 20 min delay before our orders. The food came about 25 minutes later . However it was delicious. We did not order desert because we wanted to avoid another long wait which we had anyway waiting for the bill. It should be said that the garden was very busy but the main restaurant was quiet with about 4 tables occupied. It was a Saturday evening. We will go back as everybody has off days but I hope the service improves.

703,"Crossbush, Beefeater",Food,Arundel, Steakhouse/Diner,94,Overpriced Xmas dinner - couldn’t fault the staff! ,"So we booked Xmas dinner here for 4 adults & 1 child, were met by cheery staff whom I’m
Sure would rather have been elsewhere on Xmas day.
The meal was expensive at almost £60 a person and didn’t even include any drink.
I just hope at that price that the company that own the Beefeater pay their staff handsomely for working this day and don’t leave them to rely on tips!

So the meal was a bit of a mix - my starter of a soufflé came out cold in the middle.
On our main courses I paid extra for cauliflower cheese and also one tiny Yorkshire pud and a few small sausages - a bit rich considering they missed off the carrot mash that was advertised on all our meals- I don’t know if this was a genuine error but none of us had this on our plates!
No biggie but when you charge £3 for some cauliflower cheese but don’t even bother putting the advertised menu on the plate then it kind of sticks in your throat!

As with another reviewer we also opted for the chocolate bombs and although we ate earlier around 12.30 we had the same issue.
The bomb didn’t melt because the sauce wasn’t even hot!
If this was a normal day then I’d say the amount we paid £260 (just for the food) was an utter rip off - sadly you’re not paying for the food or even the quality of the food - you’re paying for the day you eat, however with that said it would of been nice if you actually got what you paid for!
The veggie roast I have to say was delicious, actually the saving grace of the meal.
The staff I couldn’t fault, the service was great and they were all very happy and polite.

Ordered food and drinks inside and was told hot drinks would be brought out. This is where everything went wrong! The food arrived before the coffee (40 minutes after ordering). We where then able to sit there looking at our meals getting cold because they hadn’t brought any cutlery out. When they did, they hadn’t brought enough and had to go back to get more (we were a table of six, that’s not a high number to count to). The drinks then arrived and the waiter said “I’ll get you some different cups, these ones are dirty” (the cups he’d just brought out)!

We over heard another table complaining the drinks were taking a while. A suggestion to improve would be - if you’re having people order at the counter, make the drinks for them to take back out. Very common in a lot of places.

712,Royal Norfolk,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,10,Awful breakfast seating and bad service all round.,"The seating arrangements were ridiculous. Your table at breakfast is prearranged, so regardless of where you would like to sit in practically empty restaurant, everyone was sat in two rows with about six inches between the tables. Not ideal when you need to have private conversations or when you want a relaxing breakfast.
Expect a long wait. The waitress was run off her feet and did a splendid job, whilst the manager walked around doing very little. Everyone had to wait and sit around uncomfortably close together.
The full English was more like a child’s meal. The standard of the ingredients was very poor, especially considering it’s a restaurant.
When I told the manager that the organisation of the breakfast service needed reviewing, especially the seating arrangements and staffing, she replied they have to prearrange the seating as it’s easier for them.
Which says it all really, its customer service is clearly not a priority.
With nothing to do but seat people, and this being prearranged, isn’t the restaurant managers job a bit redundant?

725,Wave Hotel,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,345,Wave Apartments – brilliant!,"We’ve been to Butlin’s on adult weekends many times but this was only the second time recently after an absence of several years. Our previous stay was in January 2019 in the Wave Hotel (Dolphin room – reviewed previously). This time we found a reasonable deal for a Reef apartment and wanted to try that since we love having extra space and a seating area.

We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment (double room plus a submarine bunk room) and loved it. The balcony was huge with a panoramic view across Bognor from several angles as it wrapped round part of the apartment, and included a sea view which could even be seen from the lounge sofa. The rooms are so funky and colourful. We were very happy and comfortable. The kitchen/lounge area had floor to ceiling windows including 2 patio doors (one in the kitchen area and one in the lounge). We were on the 6th floor, and whilst it was not the top floor, there was no apartment above us due to the staggered design of the section we were located in (I’m not sure if this would be the case for all apartments though). This was great as we detest having rooms above us as we always get disturbed by guests walking back and forth above. Not only that, but our room was at the end of a corridor and we didn’t hear anything at all from other guests coming and going late at night (on an adult weekend), so it was perfect. An added bonus was that both bedrooms have internal doors, so that’s another safeguard against any possible corridor noise. In this apartment the children’s bunk room was much wider than the narrow one we had in our hotel room previously but the door did not have a porthole in it. The entrance hall to the apartment is spacious. A surprise in the kitchen – which we nearly missed and I don’t recall seeing mention of on the website – was a sweet little dishwasher in what would normally be the bottom section of the oven. It was only because we’d been left a couple of dishwasher tablets that I started searching for it. After almost giving up, I eventually noticed the sticker on what looked like the bottom oven which said it was in fact a dishwasher (you can only wash or cook at one time – not both – but that was fine as we didn’t use the oven anyway). As well as 2 dishwasher tablets, a tea towel, washing up cloth, sponge scourer and a miniature washing up liquid was provided. The bath towels were of a decent size and we were glad to be given 2 key cards.

Everything was clean, the apartment had air con, and as already mentioned, great views (though I’m guessing possibly not all apartments would have such good sea views). We chose to spend a sunny evening with drinks on the balcony instead of going to the entertainment one night because it was so pleasant as the sun was setting … I could almost have been fooled into thinking I was abroad! The TV in the lounge had a built-in DVD player, as did the TVs in the bunk room and master bedroom. (I’ve included a photo of the input ports below the main TV in case anyone is interested in bringing and hooking up their own devices.)

If I was being very picky I’d say the TV in the lounge could have been bigger. It’s on a bracket in the kitchen area so you can pull it out and angle it to watch from the lounge, but it’s quite a distance from the TV to the sofa for the size of the TV. I think I saw the TV signal breaking up in the bunk room as I was loading a DVD, so beware that may not be reliable. The floor in the kitchen/lounge was very creaky. I also happened to notice that there was no mattress protector on the bunk beds, which was surprising. Otherwise everything was very good.

We so enjoyed the apartment that we unexpectedly booked to return. The apartments can be prohibitively expensive at certain times of the year for couples, so look for deals. This visit was the first time we’d seen it at a price we could afford but whilst there we saw an even better deal online which was too good to miss.

729,White Swan Arundel,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,0,Disgraceful,"We went to the White Swan last Sunday as a family, the meal went ok until we ordered the dairy free icecream for my 2 year old son as he has several severe allergies - the menu didn't say this contained nuts nor was this pointed out to us. My 2 year old went into anaphylactic shock and an ambulance had to be called. At this point we were tried to be moved to a private room several times, my cynical side believes perhaps to move us out of the way. Whilst waiting for the ambulance we were also charged for the meal before being blue lighted to hospital and spending 12 hours there. The manager was meant to call us to see how my son was, they didn't. When we called them, they told us they are fully compliant with any laws as they had an allergy matrix, which at no point was given to us. They have promised to change the wording on the menus and that they are legally compliant but we will be making sure with further advice.
When I pointed out to the manager that taking payment was at least distasteful at that time as we were fully distracted they have just posted us details of receipts so we can check them - at which point they pointed out that the ice cream ordered wa dairy free (even tho the issue is with the cashew nuts)! they have also charged us for the icecream that had a bite taken and put my son in hospital. We feel we are fair and have raised points directly before writing any reviews but i just feel the lack of customer service and respect here has been appalling and I fear for what could have happened.

On arrival we found a pleasant if a little tired, village pub. Staff were friendly.

We were shown to our room and found it was extremely basic and had a shared bathroom. We thought we'd booked ensuite (but that could have been our error so would be unfair to apportion blame). We asked about changing rooms and we're told that no one else was booked in to share the bathroom - possibly reluctant to change us because it would mean preparing another room (I don't know). We were too tired to push it so we agreed but this did mean that our route to the loo and shower was across the stairs from the bar and dining room.

The food and drinks were good. Usual pub menu and range but was hot and nicely presented.

On retiring for the night, the pub was closed and dark around 10.30/11 so our moonlight flits to the loo weren't as stressful as anticipated.

The shower sounded like it was powered by a combine harvester and the shower screen door was propped up outside the bathroom having been replaced by a shower curtain. The shower holder was broken so we couldn't change the angle of the water so the floor and bathmat were cold and soggy by the time we'd showered.

I can't comment on the standard of the other rooms but our room most certainly wasn't 4 star and I'd be reluctant to return. I do have to acknowledge the age of the building and that updating it would be tricky, but keeping what they do have, in better order would make a nicer stay

742,The Burger Shop,Food,Arundel, Restaurant,73,DON'T BOTHER!!! ,"Family day in Arundel for the festival. Looking around for restaurants which cater for vegan. Came across this one. Luckily it was past lunchtime so we got a table with ease. The waitress handed us all menu's and left us for few minutes, which was the normal thing to do. She came back and took our drinks order. The drinks took 10 minutes to arrive. Then she left us to decide on our meals. Came back five minutes later. Took our order. And we waited. And we waited. Finished our drinks. The restaurant was half empty at this point. So it wasn't because there was a rush on. After half hour my husband got up and asked where our food was and how much longer. We were first told 20 minutes longer. We said ok we're leaving, we'll pay for the drinks but we'll leave it there. Then they said, no wait, where are you sitting? Oh yeah yours is out next, so five minutes not 20. It actually was 10. When it arrived, my burger that was described as mildly spiced was hot spice, and cold in temperature. So we complained and they offered to make another. My granddaughter took a bite of hers, and again it was cold and pink in the middle. The order of chicken wings which again was described as mildly spiced, were hot spiced. So after all the waiting, cold food, half cooked burger, and spicey food we said enough was enough and we left.

749,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,211,Didn’t meet expectations,"We stayed this weekend to attend an event. We were welcomed and the checking in process smooth.

The hotel is near to Arundel and has extensive grounds.

Our room was well equipped but had an extremely noisy creaky floor!

We had several meals during our stay. There was a good selection of typical hot and cold options for breakfast.

However both our evening meals were unacceptable, and lacking In flavour, with over cooked or under cooked elements and the service was extremely slow.

Friday’s buffet was absolutely awful, watery bland ‘curry’, pasta, ‘stroganoff’ and the most basic of salad options and deserts.

Last night’s dinner service took over 3 hours as there were very long waits in between courses so we finished at 2240!! This meant that we lost an hour of our entertainment leaving guests disappointed!

The hotel doesn’t have any lifts which made it difficult with our luggage as we were on the second floor with a lengthy walk to our room (far from ideal for anyone elderly or with health issues).

Several areas are looking rather shabby with maintenance needed, new carpet, paint etc.

The staff were very polite and helpful throughout our stay but clearly just could not cope - there just weren’t enough on duty.

All in all we did not get the standard of stay you would expect of a 4 star hotel so feel disappointed.

750,The Spur,Food,Arundel, Pub/Bar,18,‘Clicky’,"The Spur is a quirky building in lovely grounds. Clean, spacious and with a decent size car park.

However, those are the only compliments I can mention about this place. We had called and booked and on arrival were shown to a good sized table this is where our evening swiftly went downhill.

The bar-man came over to our table after we had sat waiting for about 20 minutes and begrudgingly said ‘I suppose you would like some drinks’ he took our order, rolled his eyes and went off to make them- clearly a hassle to him!

A further amount of time passed and a lady came over to take our orders. They had mussels on the specials board, which I asked if they could make a starter size portion, if not I would have the Brie. She huffed and puffed and argued it would then be hassle to sell the remaining portion. To which I totally understood and said the Brie would be fine. She continued to make a sarcastic scene of this but agreed to do the starter size.

After about half an hour our starters came out, thus the mussels were cold and very little accompanying mariniere sauce in the bowl.

We ordered a burger and fish and chips for our mains. The burger deemed to be beef, but tasted rather rubbery, was a weird burgundy colour and on the cheap side. Coleslaw, was very watery and chips very oily!

The fish batter was also very oily and peas crunchy!

The food is average pub grub, the staff however are rude and the whole atmosphere was clicky. No one came to check how our food was. No one even said goodbye nor thank you when we left.

It would seem unless you are a local you are deemed as a huge hassle to the staff.

Check in was super quick and easy and our pitch was huge and easy to get our stuff to with the provided whellbarrows. The chap who checked us in was super helpful and a real example as to what hospitality should be. This pitch was on the right as you go down the track and as far back as you can go from the kids rope swing.

We truly loved almost everything about this site, clean showers, nice and quiet neighbours and all the other plus points previously mentioned in others posts.. But! There is considerable road noise.! We arrived on a Sunday and there is a race track not far away that didn't help but I think the bulk of what we were listening to was motor bikes on the A27?

It did quieten down pm but it woke me about 5am the following day. It sounds odd but if you pitch to the left of the path, closer to the road, it is quieter due I think to a hill that deflects the road noise.

Would I go back? Yip absolutely but I'd take an ear plug.

In saying all that my 10 and 18 year olds slept like logs.

758,Hotham Park,Attractions,Bognor,Nature/Gardens,688,"Good to visit, lots to do and mostly Dog Friendly","We went with our two year old granddaughter and as the park isn't too big she was fine with walking around. The gardens are generally well kept and the train running through the park was very busy. It's £3 for adults and £2 for children but you do get to go around twice which isn't too bad. The trains were running every half hour. The boating lake was out of use on our visit and, to be honest, the lake looked a bit green so wasn't too appealing. The toilets by the lake are pretty clean but the others on the other side of the park aren't, so choose wisely. Dogs are free to roam except in the children's play area and the crazy golf. The golf looks like they've spent a lot of time and effort on it and is worth the slightly high cost. The children's play area is pretty good too, but some of the kids were a bit over excited and boisterous on our visit. We stayed for a couple of hours (£1.50 for the car park) but you could happily spend a lot more time, especially if you take a picnic or eat in the cafe.

759,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,5,Terrible experience,"We spent 3 nights at the Wave hotel. On arriving back to our room on the final day we noticed our games console was missing. One of the controls had been thrown on the floor and the console itself was nowhere to be found. From the outset Butlins gave the impression it wasn’t really their problem. They called the resort officer to conduct a door audit to see who had been in and out of the room during that day. It showed only ourselves and housekeeping. They proceeded to check with housekeeping whether any one had found the missing item - and lo and behold - no one had.
We’ve since returned home and had a phone call to say that they haven’t been able to recover the item and their investigation ends there.
All I can say is to warn you - do not be too comfortable in Butlins accommodation. We made the mistake of not putting our valuables in the safe - I would advise everyone to do so to avoid being targeted by the thieves who hide amongst the housekeeping staff. We are lucky enough to have travelled all over the world and never had an item from our belongings stolen from our accommodation.
It was out of the ordinary for us to holiday in the UK and now this has put us off Butlins and the like for good!
My advice, don’t leave any valuables out, don’t trust housekeeping staff and don’t rely on the resort to offer any real help when things go wrong. Not a safe place where you can feel at home.

When we finally got in the toilets , they smelt so disgusting, were very dirty and one had no light so the toilet was pitch black.Considering the number of people who visit the lake the toilets are totally inadequate and need investigating.

764,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,0,butlins bognor regis 4 nights stay for tots break programme 3rd june -6th june 2019,"This my first time coming to a butlins resort, i expected high service and standards , i was checked in a place that was noisy and in the middle of there entertainment area called skyline dome for the children which i never expected, i hardly could hear the representative and felt i had to raise my voice, The room location was good near the main entertainment are skyline dome, however it was inconvenience to get up there with a pram and a toddler and my luggage. the room was up a flight of metal staircase that stated its dangerous as it had slip signs. I was not impressed there was no lifts to reach your room. My luggage had to be left by the stairs and taken up gradually, There no security or safety as anyone can help them selves to luggage especially as we had to take our toddler up the stairs with his pram first and put in the room and have 1 of us to look after toddler, whilst the other loaded the luggage 1 by 1 up the stairs to our room.
As a result my nikon camera and camera bag went missing, it was stolen off our trolley, and we did not get it back, be aware there a lot of thief's ,they can be EITHER \ the guest and staff in the resort. if there was a lift we could park our trolley in front of the room and load instantly without losing our belongings to a thief.

Our dinner plan was ridiculous we could not eat later then 6pm under the basic dinning plan which was not stated at the time of my booking I made online or when I went to the resort, I only found out when i was turned away from the restaurant. They have premium dining but you only get another extra 1. 5 hours.

The toilets in the resort do not flush properly you have hard time getting the tissue down let alone your own number 2's. In Our room I had to call for the plumber 3 times ,twice for toilet and once for the shower as the water wasnt going down in the shower tray.Then the hot water tap all of sudden stopped working and my husband and i needed a shower, they was no one at guest services as they close by 8pm. my husband could not find where to go , he enquired with burger king staff as they open until late, they told him to go to the first aid room for security. The security put an alert out for the plumber to sort our hot water out. this was not done until 11pm. he was quick to come but its not great again we have no phone number to call for assistance.

 the entertainment also has restrictions the rides inside catered for my toddler, however the soft play had 2 areas and he was restricted as he was under the height and they do not allow adults to accompany child in the soft play, bizzare as my son a member at cheeky chimps and he can do all the soft play areas without me being there or if needs assistance ,im not allowed to enter and help. They had a animals area but did not know the times for animal to be let out for child to handle. This was not on there programme itinerary. It was great lots of fun activities for children to do on their itinerary programme from play-dough and art crafts and( pottery painting and go karts and mini golf was all extra charges which i did not think was fair as I paid alot of money for the entertainment passes 90 pound person including this rate for my 2 years old.If your into the teletubbies mr men and milkshake mr potato head and paddington bear you enjoy the shows.

The BRAND NEW splash pool thats there has new water pool and slides area it is fantastic for the adults and kids. however again there was restrictions on 2 of the slides my child too small and they would not allow him in the lazy river or the faster log flume. I agree their health and safety risks however i would not endanger my son safety, i held him at all times when i went on the lazy river and did not let him out of my sight. the fast log flume was not that fast, the racer slide was more faster and that did startle my child. I was refused the lazy river on my last day, other days i went on with my child, their staff neglected there duties here, as they did not check my son height the first 2 days at all and allowed us on the ride together. I been to dubai and turkey and egypt they allow my son on the water slides and rides that had height restrictions as sole person, as long as I accompanied him and for further safety they gave mats and inflatable rings.

I recommend to stay on self catering as you can eat at your own time and pace with out feeling rushed. And have a treat at the restaurants that operate later. the fish and chips and the dinner and pub kitchen i recommend highly. papa johns i did not rate it worsen then pizza hut and i only ever go pizza oven bake places like zizzi or pizza express which better.

You get to have photo shoots with the character that they have for entertainment which is great but they need more time slots. And when i went to collect my photos like everyone else did on the last day we felt rushed. as we needed to eliminate photos so we had the best choose. its expensive it cost 35 quid for 5 photos. even then the assistant cut out the pic incorrectly and was refusing to rectify and kept it professional and said ive paid for a service and it expect it perfect.

My last night at the resort we could not get into our room the door would not open, I had to call emergency phone number that was provided to me after I made a complaint about having to go to the guest services in person as no phone provided in the room to call for assistance on our first night when had to go out to get a plumber service. We had a reception area by our room but it was operational only 3 days out of the 5 days being there and for short period of time only. We was not informed about a 24hr services if they was emergency at all. we just had to wait until the morning to get hold of guest services to complain for services we did not received.
They dont even provide basic to be at hand easily like a plastic rubbish bin lining. We had to pop out to get hold of lining bags.
we waited a bout 15 minutes to get our door reopened so we can enter this disturbed my son sleep as it was 930pm and he needed to go to sleep. in the result he ended up weeing himself as he needed toilet and we could not get inside the room. He also caught a mild cold the next day as it was windy waiting outside. my husband got a cold as well. The door battery was changed by another technician as the first technician just tried using a master key to open the door, so he came ill- prepared. Finally we got in,
The outdoor play areas great you have 3 playgrounds for the kids. then a cars driving school area , archery, football, and mini golf areas. The traditional fairground area looked better in the pictures, when we got there it needs re painting to brigthen up, there restricted times again it opens 10am until 4pm. if only it stayed open until 6pm. Again height restrictions in place for toddler on certain rides, however the most ridiculous was the bumper cars, I went recently to chessington adventure world park, and my son was allowed to go on the bumper cars, I have been to locaL fairgrounds in my area and he been allowed here he was not allowed, even though he be accompanied by an adult who drive the bumper car. As a result not many parents used the bumper cars as they had toddler my son height. I complaint to the guest services and they said the safety regulations are set by the ride company however I been to chessington park which is more of a specialist in rides and they allowed my son? I felt the guest services just made poor excuses and were controlling the situations to there advantage so toddler are kept restricted.

The go karts area allowed children over 97cm on with adult however this was not clear to me I was told as long as my toddler was over 90cm when i waited over 20 mins and it was our turn my son was measured and we told we cant take the go kart course. we went to get refund and told why and it was obvious because of ,my son height. The the helter skleter ride i got to the top and turned away it was a very steep climb and exhausting as i carrying my toddler. refused for not having a long sleeve top on. I wasnt told this before been handed the sacks to sit on by the assistant. I was very annoyed and frustrated. as it was tight squeeze to get pass other parents and children to climb back down the steps.
Yet this was called a tots break events programme.

Overall they good point and bad but the accommodation, checkin area improved alot. and after hours services need to be explained better, the information pack provided did not have any contact number or information to say where to go for after hours emergency. only had an email which isnt gonna be a fast response like a phone call is. Entertainment passes need to be reduced for a toddler rate, Also the fairground rides height restrictions changed on certain rides that are safe for toddler when accompanied by adults. yet this is called a tots friendly break programme

 urgent attention is for wheelchair person could not have the apartments as they do not cater for them and this is the cheaper alternative. there no lifts for them to access either or wide paths to get around and to your apartment room.

Very few options for vegetarians.
Congealed over cooked baked beans.
Peppered chicken for a kids meal? Peppered over cooked chicken which meant that no amount of chewing would break it up to actually be eaten.
My chicken was over cooked to the point it was burnt and that was the over powering taste of the dish.
The chunky chips had a funky taste to them which was not pleasant.
My sisters vegetarian options were revolting and cold in the middle.
The salad bar which is what we like about going to the harvester was a disappointment, brown lettuce, and the rest of the salad bits, coleslaw etc was all wet and soggy/slimy.
The only good thing about it was the ice cream sundaes, it’d take someone pretty simple not to be able to get ice cream right... you’d think.
They seem to be striving for some expensive fine dining restaurant but failing on all levels.

This was promptly fixed by the hosts when we went out for a walk. We didn’t really like the step down into the en-suite, but there wasn’t much that anyone could do about that.

Entrance is very expensive and also very complicated. 4 different price plans for a ‘normal’ adult, then vouchers to use at the over priced gift shop and cafe. You get asked at least 6 times during your visit to the castle to show your ticket.

The biggest disappointment was the lack of history explained. The information given as you walk around is in no sensible chronological order and doesn’t give any stories. You do however know the dimensions of a room, when it was renovated and by whom. I don’t care about that, give me some basic simple history please. Like in every other castle and historic home.

The wife and I were really looking forward to our visit and were left very disappointed. We were planing to bring the children sometime but we won’t waste our time or money now.

799,Black Horse,Food,Arundel, Pub/Bar,4,Staff So Rude!,"Having heard that the management had changed hands we were keen to give this restaurant another go. Having read recent reviews about the food and experience we were optimistic that we'd have a local restaurant to add to our regular places to go for a sunday lunch. Admittedly we hadn't booked, but our general experience with the local pubs is that you dont need to but you may need to wait for food which is totally fine with us.
We arrived at 1.15pm to find there were 2 tables with shade available in the garden. Brilliant! We went into the bar area to ask whether we could have a menu (there's only waitress service inside and not outside, which was fine) The young lady that was behind the bar had stated there would be a 30 minute wait for food which we had said was totally fine. We were happy to wait for food whilst we had drinks. If I'm honest the way she responded made us feel like we had put her nose out of joint that we'd even asked about food. She then repeated that there would be a 30 minute wait... to which I said that was fine. She seemed surprised it was ok. But in all honesty I was happy we had found somewhere that we could get a table at without booking. I asked my partner whether he picked up on the frostyness and he completely agreed. Anyway after shaking it off, we got our toddler settled into the high chair and chose our food. Only to find that when we then went back into the bar to order food and drinks that the young lady said we couldn't order until 30 minutes time! It is the most absurd thing I have ever heard in terms of a service!! I completely understand that you may need to wait after ordering.... but to have to wait to ORDER.... is baffling! She was so abrupt I was so taken back. The most frustrating part of this was that the manager was not interested in even facing us to speak to us. We were not worthy of her attention. In fact I'm not sure if anyone was. I am gutted because it has potential to be great. No matter how good food is, Service is key and there's no point having staff that dont have any customer service skills. I am disgusted at how we were spoken to.

The irony is that we headed up to the Village Inn, they were just as busy as the black horse. We got the last table in the garden, we ordered, the staff so friendly and our food was on the table all within 15 minutes.

I got there early and sat down with a pint, looked very nice and I waited in a seat being watched by an old man with a drink he hadn't touched, he didn't take his eyes off me, thought he was actually dead sitting up.
Had my drink and decided to grab the table we had pre-booked. The staff member I dealt with was actually very nice. Anyway, my partner and our friend arrived and we all sat down with toddler and had a nose at the menu. Food sounded amazing and the price was fair.
So we went in and ordered.
Our starter was nice and I had a feeling we would have a nice time.
Until we wanted our mains. After an hour and a half wait I went back in and asked if our mains were ready, oh yes they'll be out soon. Bear in mind we had a toddler with us who wanted dinner!
Not 5 minutes later the food comes out. My partners dish was lukewarm at best. My friends steak was cooked wrong and her salad was brown and curling. My steak was also cooked totally wrong. Luckily the toddler had a good meal. So I took the steaks back (my partner was so hungry at this point she had to eat something) and complained. A half arsed apology was given and 2 more were cooked, again, totally wrong. I again went in to complain that the order was wrong and again food was sent back out. The steak I received was still cooked wrong but at this point I was starving and had to eat something. My friends steak looked better, but there was almost no meat in the steak, the cut was all grissle and bland. It was also cold. Oh, and the peas that came on the plate had freezer burn and were disgusting. The meal was an absolute disaster. Went back in and got a full refund for the meal. Luckily I spoke to the nice member of staff, who also gave my friends toddler a free ice cream in way of apology.
They should not be allowed to serve food here at all aside from the snacks behind the bar.

Firstly accommodation is somewhat looking very tired and old, definitely need to update the apartments. The whole time we where there, the accommodation reception was open once despite opening times saying it should of been open most days, so on leaving day a lot of people posted room cards through the door. We did have a spacious adapted room for medical needs so can not complain on space. We did find peices of glass on the floor which showed the apartment is not hovered on a regular basis.

Day time entertainment is brilliant; lots to do especially for young children and the new splash pool is brilliant. Evening entertainment was poor, main show was too long for under 5's and we noticed a lot of restless children including our own. The mini disco was not the traditional mini disco more like English nursery rhymes. Entertainment after show was lacking, may of been due to tots week but entertainment finished by 8pm.

Accommodation: Most of us stayed in the Shoreline hotel. The rooms were clean and efficient. There was basic tea and coffee facilities and a towel each. The rooms aren’t cleaned during your stay, but every morning housekeeping knocked to see if you’d like more toilet roll etc!

Staff: We couldn’t fault the staff. Everyone was friendly and really helpful. Any questioned we asked they were more than happy to help with.

Food: There are various eateries (pizza place, fish and chips...) but we opted for the food package with entitied us to breakfast and dinner. There was a well stocked hot fried breakfast counter and a smaller cereal/cold buffet. The area was kept tidy and food replenished well. In the evenings there was always a choice eg roast or Chinese, and a v small salad area.
For a mass buffet it was good!
Our food was in the Ocean hotel which meant a short walk over.

Entertainment: We saw a mixture of bands and music. There are different areas where they play but all in close proximity. Understandably all of the floors in the areas were pretty sticky! The silent disco would have been better if the lighting was lower - it was pull on lights.
Each area has a bar. They aren’t cheap so be prepared to spend!
We also had Bobby Davro doing a show at 1.30pm Sunday!

There is shop on site selling basic stuff but the town is only a 10 minute walk. There are also amusements and some small rides on site (the outside rides weren’t open)

All in all we had a fun weekend. Highlights were definitely the live music and friendly staff.
Low-points...Pat Sharp (too annoying and repetitive. Kept speaking over the music) Having something else to do like bingo in the afternoon could of been fun!

824,Boat House In the Marina,Food,Littlehampton, Café,1,Utterly unimpressed,"I attended a birthday party here and it is a shame to say that such a lovely venue has been let down so heavily by the management.

The owner was not welcoming in the slightest and honestly made myself (and numerous others) feel very uncomfortable. She even went to the extent of putting a negative Facebook post up DURING the party. This is a highly unprofessional way to conduct business, and this has only been reinforced by this page in which you can see the owner ARGUING with customers who have dared to leave negative feedback, instead of reaching out to find ways in which the establishment may improve.

Not to stereotype, but generally it is not in your typical Brit's nature to go to the extent of giving negative feedback (we will normally just put up and leave, never to return), and the fact that there are multiple comments discussing the rudeness of the staff on this page says enough.

I must repeat, the venue itself was lovely, and I personally did not find the other members of staff unpleasant in the slightest, however the management has massively lowered my opinion of the establishment and I am sad to say that my experience here has been my first and will most certainly be my last.",1,2.0,0.0,British,1
825,Spice Paradise,Food,Bognor, Restaurant,6,Slop in a bowl and frozen packet veg.,"Absolute slop, poor quality food, cheap frozen ingredients. We waited so long for our food we actually thought it was going to be freshly cooked. This meal was a huge disappointment and a waste of time and money.

I ordered sag paneer - which is supposed to be cubes of cheese and spinach with cream, coconut and spices. What was actually served was dire. It was made with normal cheese which melted, so was mushy, with no flavour, at all, (no spices were added) a ton of cream and spinach. I only ate a very small amount, because it was so awful. I have never had sag paneer made with normal cheese, I tried it and regretted it - normal cheese in sag paneer is wrong and lazy.

I also ordered a side of vegetable curry. What I actually got was a bowl of frozen veg - peas, green beans, carrots in what I can only describe as slop. It looked like soup made with frozen veg. I sent that back and they offered a replacement. I declined.

My friend ordered a vegetable shashlic and that was slightly better, because it didn't look like soup and had a bit more flavour. Considering the cost to make with fresh vegetables, it was shocking to see most of ingredients were still obviously from a frozen packet.

(No Quorn curry on offer, which most good restaurants now serve for veggie customers).

The nan was great, perfect.

The rice was ok, hard to get that wrong.

My friends had chicken curry and that looked edible, they said it was 'OK', nothing special.

The bill for the 4 of us was £70 which was shocking for the quality of food we were served. Complete waste of money and our time and we were all really disappointed.

The service was really slow, but the serving staff were really nice.

I had mushrooms to start...lukewarm. Hubby had salmon tart.
I ordered well done rump steak which was meant to come with onion rings, chips and salad. The steak was so dry & it was tough. No onion rings. Few beetroot leaves. Lukewarm chips.
Hubby had pie and chips with seasonal veg. Veg was cooked to death.

The extra potatoes and Yorkshire puddings didn't arrive! My daughter's tuna was over cooked and was like a rock.

838,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,3,Very disappointing in all areas,"Took our granddaughter for a term time break at Bognor Butlins as we had done last year but this time it was quite awful and what a rip off! All the activities that 9 year olds enjoy came at an additional cost usually £8 each and that is just one turn on the zip wire which was over within seconds. The archery is over booked so you don’t get your own target but have to share so spend half the time standing around. However worse than that the evening entertainment is up stairs which is serviced by only one lift! Two out of the four nights we were there the lift was out of order meaning the person in our party with mobility difficulties could not attend, that is 50% of the promised entertainment not assessable. The same happened last year and we put it down to bad luck but two years running is just not acceptable.
The food is okay for mass production but the dining room tables are really squashed in making accessibility for wheelchairs very difficult and even doing that there are not enough at peak times and people often had to wait.
The new swimming pool disabled changing rooms were really dirty on all of the four days we used them. We used three different ones and each had terrible drainage problems. My granddaughter and I actually got locked in one of them when the handle stopped working inside. We were eventually let out by another guest after repeatedly banging on the door and shouting. We immediately informed the person on reception, who didn’t offer any apology but said they would deal with it. We watched and waited she didn’t move and we were concerned that no one else should have the experience that my husband found a lifeguard and explained again and he then locked the door. Once in the pool area there were no easy access steps or hoist to get in or out of the main pool from the wheel chair. My granddaughter throughly enjoyed the different pool areas and they were successful.
The fun fair is diminishing too with two adult rides missing from last year only one of which has been replaced but with a children’s ride.
Definitely not the Butlins we’ve known before and loved but a Hugh expensive disappointing experience that we will not be repeating.

840,Church Farm,Accommodation,Littlehampton,AccomOther,0,"Dirty Prestige caravan, our fears realised","We haven't stayed at a Haven site for many years but have happy memories of the fun our own and friends children had at the Combe Haven and Lower Hyde parks (the latter no longer a Haven park)
Unfortunately these visits were often spoilt for the adults of our groups by poor cleaning standards. It’s not right but 'you' come to expect to carry out a certain level of cleaning yourself. I see other reviewers have a similar opinion. A sad situation for customers to endure for the sake of providing an enjoyable family holiday for the younger members.
Our recent visit, the first for many years to a Haven site was to Church Farm Pagham where our worst fears were realised. We booked in July, too late to hire a newer model unlike the friends we planned to meet who had managed to do so.
A newer caravan was something that had become a must for us many years ago just in order to stand a better chance of a nicer, cleaner caravan, so we were optimistic but apprehensive.
Initial impressions of the site were good although we did not stay long enough to see exactly how good the facilities were.
We'd hired a Prestige with decking, and were able to book in early at about 1300 which was a plus.
First impression of the outside of the caravan wasn't great especially as the steps to the decking looked like they had become partly detached, this remained to be seen but in the end events negated the need to confirm this.
As the fridge-freezer is close to the side door it was the first item checked and to our surprise it was very clean, from there on it went steeply downhill.
Dirty or sticky cup marks on coffee table, (not burns that couldn’t have been wiped off). Food remnants on work-tops, cutlery / crockery drainer and washing-up bowl.
Kitchen cabinet door handles sticky and greasy. Edging missing from work-top . Floors not properly swept or vacuumed. Crumbs under stained, drab, dowdy soft furnishings that we certainly didn't relish sitting or laying on. The table and chairs ; you could get better and cleaner from your local charity / second hand shop.
Bottom of net curtains in all rooms appeared stained (brownish) from condensation possibly.
Our fears realised ; and any optimism gone I phoned the site office to ask if there were any chance of an up-grade (at our expense) possibly to a newer model. Unfortunately nothing was available and the only solution that could be offered was a cleaning team to clean again.
In our view it would have taken many hours to bring the caravan up to an acceptable standard so this was not a viable option. (Ideally it also needed an upholsterer and a carpet fitter) . We realised we had no choice but return home…….120 miles , so not a decision made lightly especially as our friends would be expecting us later that day.
The staff were polite and apologetic but this doesn't alter the fact that they were unable to provide a suitable solution especially when there were only two of us.
We were told we would get a full refund but this would take up to seven days.
Not having the greatest confidence in Haven I waited a day to check what progress had been made with the refund. In short nothing had been done. Again staff were polite and apologetic and I’m told this is now in hand: I shall have to see what happens next.
It's obviously more cost effective to loose a customer and give a refund than put the problem right. Putting the problem right may involve paying more for better cleaners, giving them more time, supervising them effectively, replacing old or worn items of furniture curtains cushions etc. etc. so I guess nothing will change.
I have scored 2 of 5 only because the site seemed ok. The caravan itself didn't really justify a 1.

The service

at the dinner this was just about ok, the waitress was busy so we could understand some errors that she made to the orders, our group thought she was being over familiar and overtly friendly

The lunchtime service was better although one waitress obviously thought we were all deaf by the volume of her speaking to the group

The food,

honestly some dishes were good, others dry and tastless,
the special recommended dishes really should be avoided as they are cooked to death, over hot ( microwave possibly??) and dry

Other food was ok, but even that was not up to even 3*** standard, so the bill of between £25~£35 average per person was way over what we should have paid for food of that standard

Received within 10 mins. The lollipops were the 2 popcorn sized bites on a bone in breadcrumbs-well overcooked & 2 bites. For mains we ordered roast beef & lamb. The roast potatoes were rock hard you couldnt even cut with knife, the yorkie burnt & the veg had a funny taste & well over cooked. The beef was so fatty, grisly & you couldnt even cut through it so my cousin couldnt eat it so we told the waitress.

866,La Campagnia,Food,Arundel, Restaurant,7,Great Service. Amazing Food. ,"What a fantastic restaurant.
This is an eatery we have been to before now, and each time I am amazed how wonderful it is. If it were closer to my home I would be a daily customer.
The staff are tremendous and always courteous and as helpful as one could wish for. The food is sublime. The desserts are to die for. I didn’t indulge this time but my wife had the banoffee pie, and as I type I’m hoping there may be a morsel left for me...but I fear my wife may uncharacteristically finish the whole thing.
Thank you to the entire team and I can’t wait to come back and see you again soon.

867,Black Rabbit,Food,Arundel, Pub/Bar,22,Over and above The Black Rabbit ,"Having taken a recommendation from our B&B to visit The Black Rabbit for food we decided to take a nice leisurely stroll to the pub along the river. We looked at the menu and liked the look of the food offered. As it was a lovely evening we decided to walk along the river to the pub rather than the road.
Having taken 50 mins to walk along the river, we arrived at 20.45 A slightly longer walk than we thought it would take us.
We ordered a bottle of wine and asked for the food menu only to be told the kitchen unfortunately had taken its last order at 20.30 something I had missed on the website.

The manager was very apologetic, not really sure why as it was our mistake not his. The reason we had come to Arundel was for a belated birthday celebration for my other half.
He offered the bottle of wine at a significantly reduced cost to us and also gave us some vouchers to use for next time after he found out the reason for our stay.
Well and about anything we expected for a issue that was ours not his. It’s a shame we weren’t able to eat there that night as the food coming out looked and smelled amazing.
He called a taxi so we could get back into town.
Be aware 20.30 seems to be the normal kitchen last orders for pubs in and around the area.

I can honestly say the chicken and dauphinoise potatoes were one of the nicest things I have eaten in a long time at a restaurant and the burger was very nice as well.

We will definitely return especially as in walking distance.

Our Shish and mixed grill was delicious, served with authentic Turkish bread, a lovely garlic sauce and hot chilli - and plenty of it!
Baklava was, like everything here, mouthwatering and authentic.

906,Church Farm,Accommodation,Littlehampton,AccomOther,52,"Great stay at Church Farm - lovely park, friendly staff!","We have just returned from a lovely 2 week stay at Church Farm. This was our fourth visit to a Haven park and we really enjoyed it. Church Farm is not as big as say Hafan y Mor but the park is beautifully kept and has several features that make it worth a visit.
First of all the staff were fantastic and really made our stay enjoyable. Our 3 girls absolutely loved Ranger Oakley so compliments to him! He really put a lot of effort and humour into the Nature Rockz activities and was by far the best ranger at the parks we’ve visited. The girls also loved the lifeguard (Adam?) who joined in the pool activities, they had loads of fun playing with him. Everyone else was good-humoured and helpful, even the security guards were really nice right down to the cheery wave goodbye as we left. It makes a huge difference so please pass on our thanks to all the staff.
There was an issue with our accommodation on the first night and this was really well handled at reception so thanks for that also.
Our accommodation was very clean and well kept, no signs of wear and tear or poor housekeeping anywhere. All the public areas looked great. You can walk to the lagoon from the park which was lovely and peaceful.
The outdoor pool was beautiful and Sussex has lots of sunny weather so we were able to enjoy it. The water was lovely and warm – I hate cold pool water so I was delighted with this! The pool areas were well maintained and there were plenty of attentive lifeguards. The indoor pool was fine too, just in the sunshine it was nicer to be outside.
I love the outdoor terrace area with a view of the outdoor pool and direct access to the playground. You could eat from the Mash and Barrel or The Terrace pizza here or have a drink at the lovely rattan seating areas. Compliments also to the man who runs The Terrace at the weekends, really good fun.
The park also has an outdoor sports/games area, basketball court, tennis court, covered activities range and Water Walkerz / Bungee Trampolines which were perhaps my only quibble with the park. You can’t book the last 2 in advance with your activity passes, and I had to complain after 4 times in a row asking to use the Water Walkerz only to be told come back later – they did in the end send someone over to run them for us. I appreciate they don’t want a staff member sitting beside them day in day out in case someone wants to use them, but I think you should be able to book a time or a ticket in some way rather than having to keep on asking.
We didn’t eat in the Mash and Barrel as it’s always mediocre at any Haven park. We ate at Cooks & Co fish and chips out of necessity and it was just ok but expensive. The Terrace pizza was nice but pricey. There are a few places to eat nearby in Pagham / Nyetimber but they are a bit of a walk away so better to drive if you have small children.
The arcade area was of course popular with the kids as it always is, they love those 2p machines!!!
The regular evening shows weren’t amazing. The entertainment crew were enthusiastic but I think the shows could do with a bit of a revamp. Check out the visiting acts though – in our second week there was a comedian and he was excellent, we all enjoyed his show.
Apart from the friendly staff and the park amenities, it’s a great area for a holiday. The weather is lovely and there is so much to do in the area. Chichester city is only a few minutes away. Portsmouth is half an hour away and there is loads to see and do, we went back for 2 days (if you buy a Historic Dockyard ticket it is good for a year from the date of issue – just be warned, the Mary Rose requires a separate ticket). Brighton is an hour away. We also went further afield to Legoland and Chessington.
For groceries there are lots of shops around: Pagham has a Co-op around the corner from Church Farm and a Tesco express. Chichester has a lot of shops. There are also superstores in the area around Havant including a massive Asda.
We had a lovely time at Haven Church Farm and would definitely recommend it!

We had a couple of sides - onion rings and mac n cheese to share. No complaints with these, Cajun spice on the onion rings was a nice addition.

We heard such good things about this place, we dropped in around 4.45 on a Sunday (maybe the wrong time) I ordered a carvery and hubby ordered a venison burger. All the veg on the carvery was cold and soggy, the roast potatoes were not crispy and soggy, the gravy couldn’t have been hot as it didn’t really warm up my Luke warm dinner. My hubbys burger arrived and the chips were just soggy, the waitress (who was lovely) asked how our meal was and I mentioned mine was cold and hubby didnt even answer she just said she would report it to the kitchen. After we half finished our meal we decided to call it a day not even bothering with the free pudding, the waitress did say, was everything ok and we did complain, the manager came over and apologised and said the chips were cut this morning, can’t help thinking they were cooked this morning too! He did take our drinks off the bill £8, but I feel taking one of the meals off at £15.95 and £13.95 would have been better as we left a lot and we enjoyed there drinks!

Ordered our food which was served almost immediately - alarm bells ring at this point. Had the roast pork which was anaemic - blander it could not have got - more boiled than roasted, and had obviously been sitting in its weak juices quite a while, waiting for me to turn up. But the veg - ahh. The ""chef"" has taken his boiling technique to a whole new level. How shall we do the carrots - let's boil them, same with the greens, same with all the veg. At this point I realised that they do not have a chef, but someone who honed his skills doing school dinners in the 70's.
The gravy on my partners beef was so thin, that they had tried to thicken it with tomato ketchup.
When we came to deserts I thought, well maybe things will improve. Well, they do say that Hope is the last to die, and die it did. The bread and butter pudding was dry as a bone.

918,George & Dragon,Food,Arundel, Pub/Bar,4,"Sadly, they've lost my business. ","I would love to tell you that we had a wonderful time, sitting in the garden admiring the view with sandwiches and a pint, but we didn't even get to order. Arrived at 12pm, most of the tables were empty. I waited a few minutes to be served at the bar, and asked if it would be ok to eat in the garden as I was confused why there was a sign saying that food was only served on the small terrace - why would we want to sit there, crowded with nasty metal tables, when there's a beautiful pub garden to enjoy? The lady behind the bar asked if I had made a reservation, to which I had replied that I hadn't. I was then told, very firmly, that those who had booked got priority. Fine, we only want sandwiches and I understand if the kitchen is busy, I said, thinking a packet of crisps would tide us over. How long is the wait? ""Even sandwiches take time,"" said the woman behind the bar like I was some kind of idiot, ""and there are FIVE tables to give their orders before you!"" What? They haven't even ordered? How is the kitchen busy? I don't think they had even arrived! It was the beginning of service, they weren't busy. I left with my family, without ordering anything. I've never been greeted in such an inhospitable manner when going to a pub, especially by the person who I assume is the landlady. She should have advised, politely and with a smile, that there would be a bit of a wait as they were busy, but asked what I wanted to drink - it's a pub, afterall! But, nope. Years spent waitressing has made me more sympathetic than most, but I was made to feel like my custom wasn't wanted. Thousands of pubs across the land manage lunchtime service, and of course on busy days there will probably be a wait, but there was no excuse for the treatment we received today. The staff were rude, service is a shambles - it was chaos behind the bar already, and all these unnecessary rules to help them cope with serving food goes to show how incompetent they are at running a pub. Such a shame, it is a beautiful location - a pub that I fondly remember from my childhood. We won't be returning.",1,2.0,2.0,British,1

However on previous occasions they went to the cardamom bay and again this time, the higher amount including the 10% is entered by the restaurant into the chip and pin machine. I ask for the machine so I can put the correct amount in (without the 10%) One staff member became rather rude and others started pointing out to my parents that they had been charging this extra amount for a long time and what was the problem? Well the problem is you don’t levy stealth charges!

930,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,11,Just for Tots Break third Visit,"I visited just for Tots break this year for the third year running. My daughter always loves these breaks and being four years old this break should of been perfect for her. But here is a lost of how things have changed this year:

* Hardly anything open and what is open they are shutting before they are supposed to

* Advertised fair ground but they have removed a few rides for Toddlers height so were two rides she could actually go on

* Dont go midweek you wont get to book breakfast with the characters or any extras because people who go there at the beginning of the week have booked it all up and they dont save any spaces for mid week guests

* stayed in shoreline hotel, breakfast was cold evry morning

* New pool is great when you get to go in it, they shut it earlier than advertised and completely closed on one of the days of our stay.

* They now repeat the same shows throughout the week rather than performing different ones so if you stay for a full week be prepared to no each of the few shows available word for word

I spoke to Lyn Barlett from Butlins customer service and her response word for word was the following:

Whilst we endeavour to have all available and open as advertised, Butlins do reserve the right to make changes without prior notice across the resort.
Turning to your comments regarding the bookable activities. Unfortunately, booking these online isn't currently an available option. I appreciate that guests booking these on the day of arrival may have put you at a disadvantage.

Even after my feedback Butlins has determined that I am not entitled to any of my £250.00 back for a two night stay with breakfast. Even though we could not do the activities we wanted, the breakfast was cold and most things were shut or shut early.

My advice would be to stay away and that's coming from a loyal customer who has previously enjoyed their stay. They do not offer the same standard of service of activities anymore.

We were allocated a pleasant table but constantly in my sightline were two ladders on the wall behind my dining companion so all the rungs were strangely affecting my eyesight as I chatted...I don't think it was the wine so I will avoid that particular table in future. The radiators were throwing out a good amount of heat on a cold January evening and the restaurant was reasonably busy so good ambiance. We were in the restaurant part where all orders are taken at the table so no longer do you have to go to the counter to place orders for drinks and food with your table number so a big improvement to previous.

Extensive menu with a number of more exciting dishes in addition to pub classics, good portions, and some interesting ""healthy"" vegetables on several main dishes, not just chips and peas. Reasonable choice of wines by the glass and other drinks, teas and coffees to finish. Good range of both Salcombe dairy ice creams and a choice also of non dairy ices which you don't see so often.

Good service from very well trained young staff, competent and proficient although slightly mechanical. There was a delay in our second round of coffees appearing and this was picked up on by the serving staff who apologised for the wait. Most efficient.

Overall very good value, would not consider it at all pricey in comparison with other establishments in rural West Sussex.

I am somewhat biased in favour of ""individual"" pubs but the Worlds End is workmanlike, pleasant and professional so will return. Easy parking with both a front and rear car park.

I enjoyed the pork belly and then catch of the day and my wife really rated the veggie options. The fixed price menu is in my opinion excellent value for money. The chef is top notch and the ambiance is second to none. I will definitely be eating here again.,5,3.0,2.0,Other,0
956,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,3,Best 31st Wedding Anniversary We’ve Ever Had,"Booking - a doddle! App - ditto. Getting our Hilton Honors ref added to our stay - no probs. Checking in and choosing room the night before - inspired choice by me. Surroundings in and out on arrival - lovely. BBQ instead of 3 course lunch that was booked - best leave that unsaid!! Reception staff - super accommodating. Room - outstanding, previous reviews talk of tiny, paper thin walls and noise outside, “should have done your homework” - ours was spacious, airy and the only noise was the trees and wildlife. Personal touches from Richard Hopton and his team - chocolates, truffles and complimentary drinks, thank you sooo much. ‘Welcome’ system on the tv - very good, clear options and lots of info. Golf course - stunning! Decided on room service and huge tv instead of restaurant - slight issue, ordered from menu on tv only to be informed that that was wrong and paper based one in room should be used. No drop in choice though and quality was excellent. Bed and bedding - sumptuous, bed was so big, hardly saw the wife all night. In the morning - woke up to that bloody noisy nature again. Breakfast - huge choices, everybody well catered for (even the bloke next to us who put salt on his melon?). Overall a very very pleasant stay, we won’t be waiting another 31 years before we come again - thank you all very much.

The waitress who served us was very helpful & pleasant.
I had the sea bass which came with a sauce, with 2 crab arancini balls.
The sea bass was over cooked , not very tasty, the Arancini was cold , there was no evidence of any crab & the sauce had a layer (film) on the top like it had been sitting for a long time under a hot plate. I should have sent it back especially as it was £17.
My Nan had the crab risotto which did not have hardly any crab in it, was spinkled on the top.
The timing was out as 3 of our meals came out together & the vegetarian came out 4-5 mins later.
There were only 2 other tables occupied when we were served lunch, so no excuse for food taking a long time & not being served together.
The kitchen door was open & kept banging which was distracting & off putting.
There was a cold breeze, which when we went to the toilets realised it was coming from there as it was freezing in the ladies. My Son said it was freezing in the gents as well ( my son doesn’t really feel the cold) when I touched the radiator’s none of them were on.
The decor was great , very comfortable seats, it is a good location with plenty of parking, it would be nice to have proper napkins as paper ones are not as nice.

981,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,26,Completely unacceptable standard of room,"We visited the Hilton this week and had booked a suite at a cost of £200.

On arrival the outside looks run down but we’re open minded as to the interior. Staff on arrival were friendly and check in process was smooth and quick.

However on arriving at our room all of this went quickly downhill! I cannot even express our disgust at the standard of the room at a Hilton property. Scuffed and peeling wallpaper and skirting boards, broken tiles in the bathroom, windows that were black in the wood. But worst of all of this was the huge patches of damp and water that was coming through the walls. My child suffers from asthma and there was no way we were staying in that room - it was a health hazard and completely unacceptable for any standards let alone a Hilton suite!

On returning to reception the staff were very good and moved us into another room which was of a better standard. However can’t help wondering why we weren’t put into this room in the beginning rather than the disgusting original room as it was empty?!

Just to note the new room wasn’t perfect either and was lacking a chain that actually flushed in the toilet with ease (you had to push the button with two hands and a lot of strength to get it to work!) but was better.

Cannot comment on other facilities as chose to eat out and spend the least amount of time possible at this place, but I can say the original room we were put in was a total rip off and wouldn’t have stayed there at £50 let alone £200! Again reiterate staff were helpful.

Photos speak for themselves of the room! Not impressed!

This weekend in the New Pool... we looked around and kids were so unimpressed they wanted to leave after 30mins!!!. The next day my oldest didnt bother. Stayed indoors! To think it was the one thing they were looking forward to!!! Butlins.. this pool is for 8yo and below. Nothing for older kids or adults. We loved the OLD POOL with the Big green slide that swooshed you into a deeper pool. The whirling pool with the sit and ride inflatables was awesome in the OLD POOL. In the New Pool we had to queue for 30 mins for a 10sec slide!!! And everywhere you go were toddlers!!!!! Such a shame. For the first time ever our large party is considering an alternative annual Staycation. Haven maybe... or Centre Parcs.

We opted for food court dining and the highchairs were so dirty that we couldn't strap our baby in as he mouths everything and the straps were crusted with old food. The food was also very disappointing , not the standard we had previously seen at Bognor at dinner time. It was far too beige and some limp lettuce and tomato with cucumber was pretty much all of the salad that was available. The breakfast was perfectly lovely though.

Also in the food court , we found it to be much , much busier than the previous Easter. There were poor customers queuing for a table with tired children and people hung around our table wait information for us to finish. We went to a paid restaurant on our last night as we were so sick of the dirty , busy food court.

The only good thing about our dining choice was a young staff member named Kieran. He greeted us all with such cheer that every family walked away from him smiling. I hope Butlins are paying him well!

The apartment wasn't cleaned very well , we found a bottle of beard oil , and some sweet wrappers in our bedroom. Also our bedroom door handle was hanging off.

There were 8 of us and we had a lovely table at the back of the restuarant with a big mirrior and very comfortable seating. We were welcomed heartliy by the owner as we went in and the service throughout was very good, attentive without being obstrusive. There is a lovely menu of the day which is excellent value but we all decided to eat off the A La Carte menu which had some great choices. I started with the Goats Cheese Curd and beetroot not knowing what to expect but it was just delicious and my aunt liked it so much she is going to try and make it at home! Then I had the slow cooked shoulder of lamb which was so tender and lovely to eat. We didnt have desserts due to being already quite full with the other 2 courses and our own time contratints.

It was a lovely welcoming place for our family reunioun with great food and service and a very nice setting. I only wish we lived nearer so we could eat here regaularly!",5,1.0,2.0,British,0

I thought this was very rude I work in a pub myself and know you need to ask everyone in the group. Then half an hour later he came over again and said just so you know I need drinks indoors at 10pm it’s a legal law thing or something. He did not go up to any other table and tell anyone else which annoyed me again. We then went in at 10 and there was still people outside drinking at that time too. He was older than the other waiters and waitresses so might have been a supervisor or manager at the place but I must say I come in a lot for food and usually love the place but now he’s just made me feel not welcome and he was completely stereotypical to us,1,3.0,0.0,British,1

we was eating in the shoreline restaurant
When my daughter was standing waiting to get her food at the help yourself section
when a kitchen staff member came along and slammed a hot plate of food down right near my daughter only for the hot water from the hot plate to splash up on to my daughter and burn her stomach
I have wrote to butlins head office several times about the incident and they have just completely lied about the situation and trying to blame my child when she wasn't at fault at all
 the staff member didnt tell my daughter to move away they just come along and slammed the hot plate down and was obliviousy that they had even burnt my daughter
I never at any point shouted that My daughter got burnt
My daughter wasn't on her own I was there with her the whole time and we was there before the staff member came along that slammed the hot plate down
we had to wait for first aider in restaurant and they told us to take my daughter upstairs for a Luke warm bath which we did
 sounds like they are trying to cover there tracks and put the blame on a small child it's disgusting I'm so angry
I think the replies from a big company like this are disgusting they are supposed to be a child friendly resort and they just don't care they have listened to what the staff have told them and only are believing what they have told them which are all lies
But everything I have told them isn't right too them
This will happen again as they just don't care we came on holiday to make family memorys only for this to happen my daughther didn't deserve this to happen to her so why did it?
How can they say the incident wasn't there fault just by believing the staff's lies

1045,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,0,Disappointing,"I'm writing this review on the day of check out (not that we know where as the reception near us is always closed)
We had a silver room in dolphin boulevard which did not match the pictures. We didn't even get a double bed. Upon our arrival  (after waiting 3 hours for the room to be ""cleaned"") we noticed the beds had been made but that's it. An empty box of alcohol had been left under one of the beds the teaspoon was disgustingly filthy. I had to clean the bedside table and the storage unit for clothes so our stuff wouldn't get dirty and ruined, not what you expect to do on holiday. The bathroom was very small and the toilet seat not stable so we've both fallen off of it. Both of us have bruises from catching ourselves on the sink aswell. TV constantly glitches and loses sound. Walls very thin so could here next door snore. There was a light placed right outside our door so due to glass panels that light lit up the room the whole night... causing a lack of sleep  (again not what you pay to go on holiday for) nobody is policing the smoking rules so our neighbours decided to stand outside our room to smoke. My main complaint with the room is it made us feel ill. If we were in the room we got headaches and felt sick but when we were anywhere else we were fine. Not sure if there's some kind of leak in here. Also the carpet has some kind of bugs in it as I kept being bitten and if you sat on floor I unpack or tie shoes you'd become all itchy instantly. Due to this we had considered leaving early but felt to unwell to do so.

Splash is nice if you've got kids but for two adults it's a bit pointless can't do widths or lengths as always to many people. There's a toddler and parent hour so maybe a adult only hour or a aqua aerobics class would be good. The changing rooms are very slippy and dirty couldn't feel the underfloor heating either.

There was an incident Tuesday night near our apartment. So the next day we all got a knock at the door and handed a letter to explain. Massive waste of paper but nice of them to try make us feel safe.

The rest of the resort was nice lots for kids to do (not for two adults though). Lots of food places but all seem expensive for what you get would be cheaper to eat off resort. Supermarket is handy but again expensive they add money to the essentials. Didn't really interact with too many staff buy those we did seemed friendly.

All said we didn't enjoy it feel we wasted our money and will now have to have doctors checks to try figure out what was wrong with our room.
We wouldn't come again until we have children and would not stay in the silver room again ever.

That said the food was good and catering/bar staff tried hard to impress and the events manager on the Saturday night was awesome, even tricky problems that were not under his control he took on and sorted them.

Room block 5 floor was also filthy and all our pans etc had not been washed. Lots of cigarette buts out side our room which kept getting walked in. Was told they would be cleared up but never was.
A cleaner did come over and clean the rest of stuff that we hadn’t finished cleaning on arrival.

Wanted to hire the bikes out, but apparently they do not hire them adults only week ??
The fair was not open either.

We all paid to have a spa, the changing rooms had two toilets and two showers no changing separate room which is uncomfortable if you don’t wish to get changed in front of anybody, we were all queuing for a shower.
The main changing room was very small and hot, very uncomfortable considering you should be relaxing.
The spa itself seem to have to many people in at once. It was over an hour before any of us could use the hot tub also the ice room was broke.
I did have a facial and that was very good.

The floors in the clubs were awful so sticky, your feet came out your shoes as you danced.
The bands were excellent
So overall not a good experience with Butlin’s but it did not stop us having a good time no thanks to Butlin’s",2,3.0,2.0,0,1
1060,Church Farm,Accommodation,Littlehampton,AccomOther,16,Peaceful Site,"We spent 7 days in a 3 bedroom Delux New Model in September. It was very peaceful but maybe this was because it was after the holidays. It was clean and fairly spacious with an on-suite toilet in the double room. The site is quite a big one and it is a pleasant walk to the seafront. There is a Co-op Supermarket and a fish and chip shop near the beach as well. We strolled around the site and along the nearby Nature Reserve. On site there is a small supermarket and Mash and Barrel but we never tried it. We had a pleasant drive into Eastbourne which took around 30 minutes. We also drove to Chichester which was only a few miles away. Another day we took the train to Portsmouth which was a great day out. Our stay was pleasant and peaceful, not to mention value for money. It is a great place to stay for a break and especially if you want to explore the surrounding areas. Recommended.

Having chosen fish dishes from the Specials board, all I can say is, the Red Mullet filets resembled worn out shoe soles and didn’t taste very nice at all. Such a shame considering the waiter convinced me to try this dish.

Then Amanda had the unbelievable idea of popping to the other nearby restaurants to see if they would deliver a gluten free option to our table (I know it sounds crazy but it's true!!)....To cut a long story short my daughter ended up with a fantastic meal from the restaurant next door with the chef even popping in to see how she wanted it.

The Castle itself inside and out is very impressive, I loved the library and castle has a wonderful feel to it, all the attendants were very helpful and informative.

The restaurant is themed as a castle banquet, my only gripe would be i asked for a Caesar salad however was served mixed leaves with french dressing?!?!, I asked for a Caesar salad and they just added Caesar dressing on top!?!?!. You are paying restaurant prices therefore if they serving Caesar salad, it should be with Cos lettuce etc. I was disappointed with this!

1097,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,13,Don’t waste your money! ,"Came to Butlin’s as a family of 3 for a weekend trip. We stayed in Oyster Bay. We didn’t have high expectations as we had picked the budget accommodation as we felt the hotels were way over priced for a 3 night non peak break. The rooms are very basic, they do have everything you need but it’s all very old. We were in an end room felt like a fish bowl as all windows are over looked. If your not a fan of natural light and enjoy being watched from all angles this is the place for you. The bed was comfy, on arrival it was broken one side. Staff came around to check on all rooms which was great. Our bed was fixed quickly. The whole apartment was cleanish! The noise levels are a lot though! Walls are cardboard thin so even if neighbours are quiet you can hear it all. Best part was the stairs.... it was incredible made the whole apartment turn into a bouncy castle/trampoline/waterbed experience. Whenever anyone walked up the stairs and hit the landing jumping or not you move with them!
They need to put signs up to remind people that at 11pm some younger children still like to sleep!
The whole park is good but not great. Aimed at younger children around 8. Not much for teenagers. The staff are doing their best but you can see considerable cut backs. The fair ground only has a handful of rides so you can spend more then an hour there. The bigger more exciting drawing you in type rides are charged. And on the expensive side. As is golf, bowling, driving school - all paid for attractions.
Mirroring what other reviews have said nothing is open before 10 attraction wises and lots of the restaurants and ice cream place don’t open til 12.
Scoop the ice cream place is worth a visit. One big bonus of the site.
We booked and visited the diner on Saturday evening. This place is a joke. We waited over an hour for our food. Took 20mins after being seated for our drinks ordered to be taken and then another long wait of 15 mins for our food order to be taken. Then had an hour wait. Which would be expected but there was more empty tables then full ones. Another table walked out as it took so long. We complained and our food order was chased but still didn’t speed up the food process. Staff were apologetic but it took them a long while to come over. Not worth it go to burger kind instead!
The pool is the main attraction, it’s very new and is great. The rapids are fun but only if your children can swim. The changing rooms are disgusting! And very unsanitary. Be prepared to queue for everything.
Staff at evening shows are great though.
Very mixed bag even for a cheap weekend away with the kids, it’s not worth it at all. Another once great historical thing going down the drain! Try haven or dare I say pontins instead!

The park is very quiet and we enjoyed our relaxing stay in an Oak 2 bedroom lodge with hot tub. The lodge was clean and spacious and was provided with extras such as handwash in both the bathroom and en-suite, washing up liquid, tea towels and oven gloves (these haven't always been at other holiday parks we've visited). The bathrooms would have benefited from having a cabinet as there wasn't anywhere to store toiletries apart from 1 small basket on the wall in one, also a shelf/basket in the shower would've been handy. There was a washing machine/dryer and I was pleased we had a clothes airer as it's annoying when there's no where to hang your washing or swimwear to dry (other lodge/caravan parks take note). The free WiFi (by WiFi Spark) wasn't reliable or strong enough to do much so we ended up getting extra data bundles for our teenage daughters. We all used the hot tub (our daughters were in it every evening) although it isn't really big enough for more than 2 to 3 people at a time. Don't stay here if you're expecting a lively holiday park, it's a quiet lodge park with no facilities on site, we knew this and it was just what we were looking for.

Far credit to the waiter though, as he spotted this and said he wouldn’t charge for my plate. Still hungry, I ordered a sticky toffee pudding. Don’t make that mistake. It was an insipid, dry sponge with a small amount of frankly disgusting toffee sauce on top. It resembled no STP I had ever seen. Again, one mouthful and I couldn’t eat any more.

The food is amazing, really well presented and top quality, the service is very good without being over attentive, the facilities are clean, its not cheap, at good Arundel prices, but then the food quality and presentation warrants it. From that perspective it would be highly recommended. However, there are a couple of minor consideration. It a bit stark, the lighting is very full on / harsh, so it does not create any ambience, a few dimmers and some table lights would help a lot, and it has a huge echo problem, so its very noisy even with ordinary conversation.

1113,Spotted Cow,Food,Littlehampton, Pub/Bar,2,Worst Sunday lunch ever.,"Well - I have just returned home at the end of a day when my family and I experienced what must be one of the worst lunch experiences ever.

We arrived at 1.20pm for a 1.30pm booking and were shown to our table. Finally someone took our drinks order at around 1.45pm and the drinks arrived at 1.55pm at which time we were informed that due to lack of kitchen staff it would be another half hour before they could take our food order and then maybe about half an hour more before we would be served. We were asked if we wanted to stay (bear in mind we had just got our drinks) and knowing that it was nearly 2pm and there was probably no chance of getting a table elsewhere we decided to bite the bullet and stay - as long as we weren't charged for the drinks. Which they agreed to.

Our food order was actually taken at around 2.15pm and we waited for our food. And waited and waited and waited. And waited. We complained to the management who, I'm afraid to say, were decidedly unconcerned. In fact I would say that the owner was actually rude in his response. ""Oh, It's coming. It's coming"" he said - as if that was enough.

Finally the food arrived at 3.15pm! One and three quarter hours after the time of our booking. Needless to say, by this time, my family were starving, losing the will to live and almost willing to accept anything. The meals were more or less OK except for one beef dinner which was almost cold. We were offered free desserts but to be honest we just wanted to leave as soon as possible.

If only we had been told about their staffing problems when we first arrived instead of after half an hour we would have had a better chance of finding a lunch elsewhere. I'm afraid that if this is the usual attitude of the owners then they are in for a rough ride in the pub business. We will certainly not be returning and I would advise anyone else to think twice before booking.

I have to say that I have given The Spotted Cow one star for one reason only. And that is for the very polite waitress who did her best to look after us and was obviously sympathetic to our appalling Sunday lunch.",1,1.0,2.0,British,1

1128,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,5,no sense of urgency or organisation,"I turned up ready for a wedding with the intentions of enjoying my stay without any hassle.
After the amount i paid for a ""deluxe room"" to make the occasion special, it annoyed me to my core to hear that friends who had paid a percentage of what i had were offered suites and rooms of the highest standards. Friends of mine had also lost their suites due to other peoples upgrades.
We wanted to have a nice family meal before the big day and after ordering 10 meals for the table, we then waited forover an hour in what was an empty restaurant. We were made aware of the extra wait for BBQ food but anything over an hour it would of been appreciated if we were made aware of the status of the food. Eventualy the food did turn up albeit it the wrong orders and therefore leaving me still with a hungry stomach. I was scared that if i ordered more i would be there well into the night. Not ideal prep for a long wedding day. We did have our drinks removed from the bill but even the drinks took over 20 minutes to arrive. it was only a nudge from my friend who was fed up of waiting , who went to the bar himself to get a separate drink as it was a hot day and was parched (34*)
On the day of the wedding i needed to iron a number of shirts which luckily was not a problem as the room had all of the utilities it promised. ALTHOUGH even with the iron only half full it decided to leak all over my shirt leaving a water stain. It was at this point that my opinion on the Hilton Hotel brand had been tarnished. To the point where on the last day of my stay at 11:15 i stood at the downstairs bar in an attempt to get a fruit shoot for one of the kids and was unable to due to NO STAFF manning the bar which i had been directed too. This was not a busy time of the day and i had to walk away and disappoint the child of my failure to provide a sweet beverage in what was one of the hottest days of the year.

From the moment we arrived there were children running around the restaurant (from the large group), we were all a little concerned with all the plates of hot food coming out of the kitchen, and to be honest you don’t expect that in a restaurant when trying to enjoy a meal out. We decided against starters so we were given complimentary nachos to nibble on while we waited for our mains, which was a lovely touch and quite tasty, although the cheese appeared to be like the sort you’d expect to come out of a squeezey bottle. The main course (I chose a burger and fries) was huge, far too much for myself, although I’m sure many would be able to finish it off, so great value for money. Unfortunately the burger itself was nothing particularly special, a few of us found the burger bottoms to be quite soggy and found that we had actually been eating the paper it was served on as that too became very soggy. The cheesy chips appeared to have the same squeezey cheese on.

Having seen some photos of views of the hotel roof I called the hotel directly, prior to staying, to ensure it didn’t have this so was disappointed to find the side view was just that!
The front view, however, was much nicer.
Friendly staff and quick check in.
Rooms were all clean and daily housekeeping was good. Worth noting they don’t put dishwasher on like the do at Center Parcs, not a big deal though, easy to manage! 😀
The room is spacious with good air con/heating and comfortable beds.
On the down side there are no heated towel rails which are useful for drying swimwear.
Neither of the DVD players in the kids bunks worked and reception were not interested when this was reported. Apparently the DVD players are not being replaced, my thoughts are that they shouldn’t advertise them if they are not maintaining them as leads to disappointed children. My little one had spent ages choosing ones she wanted to watch in bed. (For the novelty).
The showers were good but water not really warm enough, if, like me, you like a hot bath or shower rather than just warm.
The cafe in the hotel is really good for lunch in a nice chilled setting. The staff were so accommodating of dietary needs and made be a bespoke meal to be gluten free but include halloumi. (The rest of the site not so accommodating)

The staff were totally miserable and distant, if the person who served us cracked a smile they would need to reapply their makeup.

We were able to check in at 1pm and our room keys are activated at 4 so that meant no long queues at 4 to get your key. Once 4 came we came to apartment on the 2nd floor and whilst we were lugging our luggage up I turned round and one of the housekeepers had also carried some of our stuff up for us which was really kind. Every single member of staff we encountered were lovely and stopped for a chat. The place is kept very clean and tidy. The circus was brilliant!! The skyline gang as ever put in great shows and although people have said that these are the same shows all the time, it's perfect for the kids as they learn the songs and dances so can join in. My son met every possible character and literally just smiled for the whole holiday. That's worth every penny.

On entering the caravan and looking around it was nothing like the pics on website, it looked very tired and the living area was cramped, we had no 40 inch tv or hairdryer that was supposed to be included. I rang reception, they were very helpful and offered us a 2 bed prestige caravan , we decided to to transfer to this one and boy was we glad we did,it was nearer the complex and just looked the pics on internet. It was well equipped in the kitchen, the shower was good and a very comfy bed.

The complex was clean and well maintained, the Mash and Barrel served good food that was tasty, drinks were quite expensive, the show bar downstairs was ok, not very quick to clean tables, can’t comment on entertainment as we only saw bits of it. The terrace bar outside near the pool was clean, they just needed to wipe down tables after clearing, also be careful of the padded chairs as they hold water when it’s been raining. We had a vegetable pizza from the terrace bar and that was tasty.

All in all a enjoyable weekend away, with helpful staff and thank you to the reception staff for changing our caravan.

In fairness, a warm and friendly welcome from the staff and much was made of the fact that they have two French chefs making everything fresh every morning. I couldn’t tell this from my brownie, which rather than having that fresh, chocolately and slightly gooey texture that makes a freshly baked brownie a delight was utterly lacking in flavour and you could have been eating anything. Any taste came from the icing and basically from the sugar within, which only merited a couple of mouthfuls and nothing more. Family experience similar with an eclair and tart. Coffee was ok, but just average.

If a coffee shop I’d give a two for the welcome, but when this is trying to specialise as a patisserie and fails so miserably on that point it has to be a 1.

it’s not been open long and it’s a mess. parts of it are falling off and the place is so dirty it made me feel like i needed a tetanus shot! the changing area was so disgusting and dirty with hair and rubbish everywhere. not once did i see anyone cleaning. as many have said it’s most definitely not centreparcs!
then to add to it you can’t even accompany your children down the main slides as they are restricted to under 18?? only! i’m not sure why??? so there was very little for me to do but walk around looking at the state of the place which is supposed to be state of the art but is in fact filthy and breaking already!
then we move onto the fairground rides. half of these were broken down so basically we moved between three!
i’m sorry butlins you have really lost your edge! in tough times you will not get the customers if you don’t buck up your ideas. the state of the pool says it all. if you can’t get that right what hope do you have!

We had both had a long day and could not be bothered to raise the issue with the staff as in my opinion they should know if they are serving rubbish food!

To finish off they made me an affogato (my favourite) and my husband had the frangipane cherry tart which was truly gorgeous. The meal was full of so many 'oh that is sooo good' moments.

10/10 to them for having a full vegi menu too, rather than just a couple of options.

We were lucky to be able to stay at the Town House too. The room was lovely, both spacious and comfortable and we were able to enjoy a lovely cooked to order breakfast.

We were extremely well looked after everyone, particularly Harry who had us laughing throughout.

Arundel is a gorgeous place and worth visiting and if there I would, without hesitation, recommend a meal (and a stay) at The Town House. And don't forget to look up whist your eating to see the most beautiful ceiling.

1274,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,126,"Looks nice, reasonable value but VERY noisy","We stayed here solely because we were attending a wedding and the room was pretty cheap. There was a long queue at check-in and rather brusque staff.

The room itself was ok (122) apart from the fact that the bathroom door only opened about halfway before being blocked by the sink.

Drinks and food in the hotel were pretty expensive. Service at the bar was VERY slow and on one occasions I had to go and hunt down a member of staff to serve us.

But the WORST thing about the place is what appears to be a complete lack of soundproofing! You could hear people in other rooms in all directions - and the corridor seemed to have been specifically designed to be noisy to walk along with the characteristics of an echo chamber.

So, in summary, pretty cheap - for obvious reasons.

It’s all looking run down, not enough space inside during peak times and when raining. Can’t watch shows comfortably- kids standing on walls trying to see what’s going on.
The new swimming pool just feels like loads of paddling pools for kids but nothing for the adults. Can’t even go down the big slides with the your kids. Extremely busy and floors filthy.
My 4 year old couldn’t go on half the stuff in the fair ground as she wasn’t tall enough, but can go on rollercoasters at our local theme park. Such a let down for my daughter.
Toddler soft play a joke! Toddlers can’t do anything without and adult helping as the levels are too high.
We used to love coming to Butlin’s but it’s just too busy now.
My advise Butlin’s - Stop trying to cram all these people in! And bring the old pool back!

I’m going to stick to caravan parks - much more relaxed.

1280,BailiffsCourt Restaurant,Food,Littlehampton, Restaurant,36,Missed a trick,"Friends booked me and a friend a spa day for my birthday . Been before but not overally impressed and sadly after the day even less impressed, in fact we left early. I must just say though the massage I had was one of the best I’d ever had and was very good - but then it should be for the price.

The disappointing factors :
When we got there we asked to have something to eat .. like a brunch, sadly we were told they had nothing to offer us, we asked whether the hotel could provide us with a meal but sadly that wasn’t possible either ..
So my friend and I actually left the premises to go somewhere else for brunch. When we got back we got changed, changing rooms really pokey and smelling of old ladies rest home . Whilst poolside we were hoping someone would come past and offer us a refreshment or something as it was so hot in the pool area, but no staff members were making themselves available , just seemed to be lots of them congregated about at the reception area folding towels , in fact I didn’t see them do anything really other than fold towels unfold towels and fold towels again. Eventually I wandered into the reception area and asked for some drinks . After our treatments again we were offered no refreshments or drinks just put into a room with no one venturing in or out . A while later a friend came in to join us for afternoon tea , once again we found ourselves sat upstairs waiting for someone to come and take some orders, but again no one about , it seems if u want something u have to make your way down to reception each time.
 We were so disappointed we decided to just all leave and and cut our spa day short, and spend our money elsewhere.
 Personally i think it’s madness that bailiffscourt are so short sighted, anyone knows that food and beverage at such a place is your biggest money maker. Clearly they don’t need the business. Most odd. I won’t recommend a day spa. I’d rather drive an hour out of the way, and have better service. Thank you but it’s not for me.

We stayed in one of the oyster bay apartments which is totally adequate for us, there was 5 of us (2 adults, 2 teenagers and 2 year old) so we had three bedrooms and plenty of space. It's not the Ritz but I didn't pay for that so dont expect it! Was comfortable and clean. The showers are very small but we all managed just fine.

Safety is the parents responsibility but we are not in charge of other folks kids and some kids are just let loose to run riot. At 13 I believe that it’s too old to go to a soft play but that’s the age the Flying Fortress limits. I took mine out after 30 minutes when the little one was charges into and fell on his head (it’s a stone floor with a carpet) The older child (a girl aged 5) was subjected to abuse from a much older boy who pushed his way onto the slides making fun of her for being a baby.

I will not be staying here again. The photos on the website must have been taken years ago. The whole place looks scuffed and tired, and desperately needs a coat of paint. We booked for a family Christmas get together and were expecting to enjoy a festive meal with an overnight stay and breakfast.

Our room was what I would expect to get in a 2 star hotel, it looked small and dingy, the over bath shower was weak with a variable temperature, and paint was peeling on the window frames. It was certainly overpriced for we got.

When we went for dinner we could see that the dining room and the tables were decorated for Christmas, however we were shown to what would normally be a conference room with bright lighting and no atmosphere. There were no decorations and the staff hastily laid up one of the conference tables for us. I couldn’t believe that we were expected to eat there! When we raised this the staff managed to find us 6 Xmas crackers and said that the groups in the dining room had all pre-booked their parties - which was exactly what we had done. We were not offered a festive menu and their regular menu is limited and dull. The food itself was cheap quality and clearly not made from scratch on the premises.

The buffet breakfast was plentiful, but again low quality and the coffee is rubbish.

1311,Black Rabbit,Food,Arundel, Pub/Bar,13,Poor value these days,"Have been going there as a local for the last 20 years. Last night was the first disappointment. Prawn cocktail was minuscule, poor value for money and my wife returned it. She replaced it with soup which was watery and again poor value. I ordered the lamb kofta which was also disappointing and served with salad that could have been carried on one tablespoon. There was also a thimbleful of Yoghurty sauce which was almost tasteless. This is a place the place locals used to go when it is out of season. Now we went there and it was almost empty. This review explains why. We didn't want to order any more food and went elsewhere.

It wasn't but rather than complain on what was suppose to a celibration of 28 years of marriage, we perceivered. The steak was dry and over powered by the truffle oil which totally ruined it. After about 3/4 of the steak I gave up as did my wife. The so called Grosse Fries looked like they'd come from a Macains frozen bag and were anything but Grosse. When the proprieter asked how it was I replied ""do you want the truth2 and she said yes. I was somewhat supprised we she said there wasn't truffle oil on the dish! My taste buds and the other staff said differently. We were given a Lemoncello as a concellation, didn't enjoy that much either.

My main complaint is the price. We paid for the gardens yesterday but today had to buy a full ticket to see the castle - that means it has cost us over £33! In Oxfordshire when you buy a ticket you get it for a year.

1322,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,2,Radiators can’t be turned off on the hottest day of the year?!,"Easter bank holiday weekend - good weather for once and visiting family in Chichester. Stayed here before with no problems, however that was in Winter. Hottest day of the year so far so thought we’d crack the window considering there’s no air con (?! A Hilton and £150 on avg a night, you’d expect a bloody air con and not an industrial fan that sounds like WW3 has started) The window when slid up, slid straight back down again. Great. No problem, we’ll just hitch it up with one of their over priced menus. 👍 Every time we came back to our room it felt warm, suspiciously warm.. turns out the RADIATOR in our room was on so that swiftly went off. After a sticky, restless night we then discovered the radiator was also on in the bathroom and it was STIFLING in there, we couldn’t seem to turn it off so called reception and a man came up told us he couldn’t do it and then he left and we didn’t hear anything so we called back 45 minutes later to be told the radiators stay on we can’t turn them off. Never heard so much rubbish in all my life!! Baking weather and radiators on? Why? What for? We were offered to switch rooms which made no sense as the radiators were on in every room. Hmm. So after this we just said sod it we’ll drive our 2 and 1/2 hour journey home at 9:30pm instead of the morning. Oh but they said we must still pay for our room and breakfast in the morning which is extortionate as it is, even though we weren’t staying! I cannot believe this place is a Hilton, the facilities are SO outdated and uncomfortable the ‘deluxe’ room we paid for promised complimentary wine and chocolates - neither of which were anywhere to be seen. I think a night in the nick would have been more deluxe, at least there’s air conditioning. The only upside to this place is the grounds it is on but we won’t ever come back to stay at this place - save your money and go elsewhere!

My first return visit in about 3 years. On positive side dogs are very welcome & everyone seems more interested in them than serving the customers!

We both ordered the Sunday roast lamb. It was £12.95 & very average. Lamb was luck warm, roast potatoes were terrible again luck warm & not cooked in the middle. The veg was a joke, for two of us we got a few bits of broccoli (5 tiny bits) 10 small carrot slices & some red cabbage. I am sure if one person had ordered a roast they would have got same amount of veg. Yorkshire puddings were as flat as a pancake. Asked for extra mint sauce. It was mainly vinegar & very little mint.

I can honestly say this is one of the worst roast dinners I have had.

The ladies toilets were disgusting and both of them were blocked & on the verge of overflowing. Very dirty & looks like they had not been cleaned for ages.

No wifi.

Only ordered 4 things, two roasts & two glasses of wine. Bill was not itemised but seemed expensive. When I queried it turns out they overcharged us £5 for wine!

1332,Toast,Food,Littlehampton, Café,4,Home Delivery - Extremely Disappointing !,"Since first going to Toast some 5 years ago, I have returned many, many times. I have also recommended to friends and family. This cafe always represented excellent value for money, great service and a warm welcome from staff. In fact I’ve written positive reviews in the past about this establishment, so today’s poor review is out of character for me, but justified.

At 11:37 this morning I placed a telephone order for Steak & Kidney Pudding, peas, mash and gravy. I have never ordered a home delivery before, but as I’m confined to home following major surgery this seemed a good idea. I was told the waiting time would be 45mins. After an hour had passed I called to find out where the order was. The woman said it had literally just left. Well it took the guy over 10 mins to deliver and I live literally one road away. Despite the fact the meal was 25 mins late there was no apology whatsoever.

Upon opening the container the first thing I noticed was a piece of white plastic - which looks like it came from one of those disposable knives. The meal was luke warm and pudding dried out like it had been cooked a while before and then left. It certainly wasn’t fresh or enjoyable.

So in summary, I wouldn’t recommend the delivery service. They simply can’t provide quality in a timely fashion. They’re late and sub-standard. Really a complete waste of money.

I think having read other reviews Toast is a victim of its own success. It was once very good indeed, but clearly standards have dropped and with so much competition around I would suggest they need to get back to where they were or loyal customers like myself will turn their back on Toast!",1,2.0,1.0,British,1

Dessert wise, the fruit crumble was lovely but I 1000% recommend the Eton Mess, it was out of this world!

We stayed last year and had a fabulous room in the main building for less money. When I spoke to the duty manager she was ambivalent about the fact we felt the room was over priced and implied that we should have asked to be in the main building even though we were unaware of the existence of the annexe.
On the following Monday we stayed at The Spread Eagle hotel in Midhurst and we were on a room and dinner deal that was the same price as the Norfolk Arms room only and that was a lovely experience, we will not be returning to the Norfolk.

This is what they did to us...
- I booked this hotel as it came up top of the search with Pets Allowed filter in TripAdvisor. The website for booking was a different agent which was still ‘Pets Allowed” (to make my point).
- On arrival, we were greeted by a friendly receptionist and 2 other staff. They saw us with our dog and they even petted him etc. The receptionist even told us ‘Your room is one of the 3 dog-friendly rooms which is outside.” She even showed us a room where we can have our breakfast with our dog. So they knew we had a dog right from the beginning and gave us the room.
- Next day, at the check-out, a different woman was at the reception. She attacked us by rudely saying “Why didn’t you tell us you had a dog? Your room isn’t a dog-friendly room and it’ll cost us a lot of money for cleaning. You should have told us in advance about your dog like most people!”. We were absolutely stunned by the rudeness and the lack of customer service! She really REALLY made us furious.
- Why was it OUR fault when we were given that room? We had a dog with us right from the beginning, it’s not as if we smuggled the dog into the room! She wouldn’t back off! They charged extra £10 for the dog anyway (which we never complained about), so what was she trying to achieve by upsetting us like that? Unbelievable.

She went to advise a member of staff who just rudely told her they knew. Well if you knew about it why didn’t you do something about it?!

The woman was rude and obnoxious. Service was slow and the ham on the ploughman’s was microscopic. Still missing three loyalty stamps and 4.75 for a shandy is a joke. Shame as this is a nice pub.

1358,"The Windmill, Harvester",Food,Littlehampton, Pub/Bar,27,Take away very disappointing ,"Since we were unable to go out for a meal my sons decided to treat me to a Harvester take away for Father’s Day.

One of them placed the order online via the Harvester website at 7pm for collection at 9pm. One of my sons wanted the “Cowboy” burger but didn’t want bacon on it as he doesn’t eat pork, although you can “customise” your order there is no way to exclude an item, only change the sides. When confirming the order the site suggests phoning the restaurant if you want any changes. The site also advises that the details have been emailed.

After about 15 minutes I phoned the restaurant and said I wanted to modify an online takeaway order. The person who answered said he couldn’t find it on their system and since no email confirmation had been received yet I should call back when that had been received.

I rang back shortly after 8pm as I was concerned that we’d still not had email confirmation and since the phone wasn’t answered I left a voice message asking them to ring me.

Come time the order was due to be collected I was greeted well and the server went to bag up the order which only took a couple of minutes. I took the order home and my wife was dismayed to find that although she had ordered 2 jacket potatoes with her “Simply Chicken” these were not to be found but it appeared she had a portion of chips instead. She had also not received any gravy. Her vegetables were cold, not room temperature, actually cold.

We felt the portions were small considering the prices seemed pretty high.

We had ordered 4 desserts which were not to be found so I returned to the restaurant. The server (no name badge that I could see) was extremely apologetic and went to get the desserts.

The chef brought the desserts out and explained they need to be heated at home since if they were to heat them the plastic containers would melt. This should be made clear on the menu when ordering.

All the staff looked tired after what had probably been a long busy day but were still polite, helpful and friendly. That was the only redeeming feature as we felt the food was poor value and quality as was the accuracy of the order.

Over 4 hours later we still haven’t received a confirmation email or return phone call.

There were four of us this particular evening. I had tomato soup with basil oil, my husband had king prawns (a large portion and very delicious!), my friend had pate and her partner had crab cakes. For main, I had chicken served with cabbage and potato lyonnaise whilst the other three all had lamb which was beautifully tender and well cooked. Two of us had salted caramel tart served with milk ice cream and another had cheese. The tart was delicious!

The starters were excellent followed by cod which was beautiful cooked. The deserts were fantastic. We chose good wines and other drinks. The staff were friendly and accommodating. When my brother ordered a gin and tonic the staff member even remembered that he liked a lot of ice from his visit for the first time a week ago. All courses were faultless.

The pool is small, the facilities non existent, the relax room not really relaxing, just a sitting room with 4 loungers, only herbal tea - not “allowed” coffee or milk. As both spa members informed us and questioned guests as to what member actually bought the milk in when it not allowed - really should guest be hearing this?
No dressing gowns or slippers available, not for discount guests anyway.
Had a lovely massage and facial but the time 25 min each was slightly shorter, about 45 mins for both. Must be because we were discount again. Definitely made to feel they were doing us a favour.
However the staff in the bar and restaurant were lovely, very good service. Lovely 2 course meal, have to buy drinks as this is not included, but that was expected.
Won’t go again, not even with discount voucher would rather save up and pay more (real price) but to a different spa, there’s a lot of competition near.
The voucher might get people in but I doubt there’s much repeat business, which is a shame. But really need to invest a bit into the place, and train some staff to make guest feel special if in the hospitality business.

The hotel looked very impressive as we drove up. Check in was fine - they acknowledged my Hilton Honors membership and gave us some sweets for our son. As soon as we started to go to our room you could see that the carpets were filthy. The stair surrounds were disgusting and looked like they all needed a good scrub with soap and water and the handrails were really sticky. The carpet and upstairs was no better. Stains everywhere and had ripples in it where it had stretched. It literally looked like it hadn’t been vacuumed for a month. The walls were marked and scuffed and the doors looked grubby. The suite was a joke. The carpet was sticky and the room smelt dreadful! A room with a pull out sofa bed that was made up so nowhere to sit, and the facing wall had a massive damp patch and peeling paint. The bedroom was no better, smelt of damp and didn’t look like it had even been hoovered and the bathroom had an old shower over the bath. Hardly the modern facilities shown on the website. We asked for another suite and were told none available until the next evening. The duty manager offered us a family room which was in the same tatty and run down state and was so small you’d be unable to pass someone by the side of the bed. We were then told that there was a new extension - unfortunately full - which presumably is where the photos were taken. We decided we would leave and stated that it was because the place was filthy and the manager said it was because it is in the process of being renovated. Sorry, but that doesn’t give you carte Blanche to offer minging accommodation. Naturally, given the cleaning of the rooms and public areas, we didn’t want to risk the food so cancelled our bookings.

1391,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,3,"""carefully curated to fit in with your tot’s routine"" - yeah right","We took our 18 month year old daughter to Butlins last weekend. It was booked as a JUST FOR TOTS weekend, which was advertised as being 'carefully curated to fit a tot's routine', and that there was no need to worry. It was set up to allow for 'enjoying quality time with your mini-me's'.

On paper, this seemed to be true. Amazing acts such as the Teletubbies during the day and Justin Fletcher in the evening which our little one loves made it seem like a no brainer. We took up a variety of offers and ended up with a 'sort out your own food but everything else is covered' total of around £450.

When we got there, the weather was a bit lousy. No one can do much about that. The staff as we entered the parking were happy and helpful, as were the staff on reception who let us know about the activities on whilst we were there. This was when we were told that even though Justin had a couple of shows on, we HAD to take the 7 o'clock showing - which is normally bed time for our little one so already not QUITE fitting our routine... but it was a holiday so we let that slide.

We then proceeded to our Seaside Apartments which we had paid extra for as they were sold as ""Perfect for families"". What they don't tell you is to enter the apartments (if you don't have a ground floor one), you first have to go up a metal spiralling fire escape to get to your floor. We looked around and saw countless families struggling to the 1st and 2nd floors with kids under arms, prams, suitcases and more. Not what I could ever describe as kid-friendly, and more than that what I WOULD describe as unsafe. Due to the bad weather these metal steps were really slippy and at several times over the holiday we had some near slips - particularly when bringing the heavier luggage/prams in and out of the apartment.

Inside the apartment itself was of OK quality, and the living room was comfy. The twin bedroom which we'd specifically booked for a travel cot however was not big enough for one. We ended up having to completely re-arrange all the furniture in there ourselves including stacking some bedside tables to make JUST enough room for the cot.

We also unfortunately were unable to find a room with a bath and there was only a shower - although we were told toddler baths were available to rent from Butlins when we got there. When we went to enquire about this however we were told these were more for tiny babies and would not fit our 18 mo. Therefore an awkward standing-in-the-shower-clutching-the-little-one was needed.

We had arrived on a Friday and saw there was a showing of the Teletubbies in the pavillion starting in 45 minutes - not many people had turned up to the resort for the weekend yet so we strolled down and it seemed relatively quiet... until we got to the central stage. Parents and their children including prams, bags and all sorts had already crowded the front of the stage and meant that our 18 mo had to stand with us at the back near the cafe. This was 45 minutes until anything else happened on the stage - there was no pre-entertainment to entertain the under 5s. If you have a little one of this age you might well know that keeping their attention for this long is near impossible and often results in a cranky child by the time the fun started.

We hoped this was just a one off, but unfortunately this was just the beginning of a heap of problems for us.

The next morning we were up and out of the room just before 9 and had read there was a Toddlers Relaxing swimming session where in the brochure it stated slides etc would be turned off so it was as relaxing for young children as possible.

However when we arrived we were greeted to a huge queue where someone near the front told us they had been waiting 45 minutes as they were operating a one-in-one-out process to get families in to the pool. There was a viewing window of the pool and it looked like a scene from 28 days later there were hoards of people. Parents were forced to congregate standing at the sides of the pool whilst their kids got to put their feet in, but more than that, all of the slides etc were fully operational meaning 4-5 year olds were running up and down and making it extremely difficult for families with smaller children to enjoy themselves. Because of this we bailed on the idea and left the swimming pool.

There were some elements of the pavilion that did operate well. The small rides behind the main stage such as the mini rollercoaster etc had quick queues and the staff did well to always ensure kids were strapped in properly. We ended up spending a good amount of time on here.

We attempted to get in to the soft play area too. As my daughter is only small we were restricted to the left half of the soft play specifically reserved for small children. However this part of the soft play had no ramps, or even steps. The only way to the upper level was through some holes leading to higher up shelves. This was NOT something that most 2 year olds were able to climb on their own, so parents were all heading up it as well to help. However this meant there was a huge blockage of kids ascending/descending down the one way up or down (apart from a slide) and it genuinely took us 25 minutes just to get up the first part of the soft play. Once up it was one level with a slide but also some steep drops that weren't safe for young kids anyway. We went down the slide and left the soft play too.

I understand some people may read this and think I'm moaning but this was for us, an expensive holiday, which we only took up because it was advertised as being a stress free curated holiday built around toddlers. Our daughter spent a huge amount of this trip agitated at having to wait in queues and not understanding she couldn't just run off as we'd lose our place for certain things.

The worst of this was of course the main event of Justin. As already mentioned we had the 7 o'clock showing allocated to us. On the back of the ticket it noted that doors opened from 6 o'clock. It also stated very clearly there would be no queue jumping (even to the point they wouldn't allow someone else in your family to hold a place for the others). But how bad could the queue be? We were in the pavilion at 4.30... and the queue started. These earlybirds were ready to wait in a queue for 1 and a half hours to secure a seat... and then wait an additional hour sat on a chair with no stage entertainment and keep their kids busy. This might be possible with a 4/5 year old you can pass an iPad to, but not with an 18mo. There was no way we could possibly queue for that sort of time with her, and instead we got to the queue at about 5.55. The queue was built up half way around the pavilion and security staff were having to traffic people the right way. We were surrounded with parents holding squirming kids and often having to chase after them, come back to the queue and explain they weren't queue jumping.

We eventually got in at about 6.20 - 40 minutes before the show was due to start. ALL the front seating area was full. Staff were on hand to direct you to empty seats but naturally these were all at the back, and the ones we were sent to were situated behind a huge pillar. We could just make out the stage and as this was meant to be a fun interactive sing/dance along experience for my daughter I was gutted that we were doing it from practically the back of the room.

A crowd next to us had 'reserved' a long string of seating for their friends by putting bags/coats on them and refused to relinquish any for our daughter to be able to see the stage without constantly switching from either side when Justin went behind the pillar in our way.

The actual show was good - and I don't want any of this to come down to Justin's performance, or even the staff at the event. They were genuinely nice and tried to help.

However the overall organisation and I suppose sheer number of people they had crammed in was out of control. It meant that a good 50% of people in there were not getting the experience they wanted. Which may have been alright for the group of wasted dads sat next to us who weren't even facing the stage, but for us who had come specifically for our daughter, it was tragic.

On Sunday, we made the decision that this had been a disaster. Everyone was tired and cranky, especially my daughter, and we came home over a day earlier than we should have done.

I've never left a holiday early before, and I've definitely never felt relieved to be leaving one. But on this occasion it was the right thing to do. Unless something fundamental was to change in the way these weekends are booked/managed I don't think we will ever be coming back.

We booked a table for 1.30 and were very disappointed when our table was out the back somewhere even though there were tables free in the main restaurant but were were told they were reserved why that was different from booked in advance we couldnt determine.
It was even more disappointing when this appeared to be the area reserved for people with children who unfortunately treated it as a playroom!
We ordered 'roast ' which was a long long time coming and frankly when it arrived it was dry and not up to the standard of many other restaurants in the Arundel area. The portion was also mean two small slices of beef!!

All four of us who had left literally the whole bowl and yet not once were we asked if there was a problem or how our meal was.
The 5th person who had ordered it, got forgotten and he ended up with a carbonara to eat after we had all stopped trying to eat ours. His though,was even worse than ours. It was so far from al dente it was basically uncooked and other than the taste of flour there was no flavouring at all.

The staff was friendly, the room spacious and clean, and the heater made the room very cosy considering that the temperature outside went to -5 that night. The car park is small but we found a space easily.
There is a Burger King and a KFC within the same area, and a nice pub just a few minutes away (close to the other Travelodge).

When we got there a member of staff asked us if we were there for food or just drinks, we said just drinks, she said that's fine, and showed us to a table. We ordered two hot chocolates that came after about 10 minutes.
The band were setting up, all was fine,
Then one of the members of staff came over just as i had my last mouthful of my drink, she bent down next to our table and asked us to move because some customers had come in. I thought that rather odd as we were also customers and it was only a small table so not as if we were using a table that a larger group would want. I tend to avoid confrontation so started to gather my purse, phone, jacket etc, and asked where to move to, I was completely shocked at her reply. She said ' well go '. I couldn't believe it, how embarrassing to be asked to leave, we were customers buying drinks intending to enjoy an afternoon of music.
We were on the way out, I said that i felt they were very rude and we had wanted to stay for the afternoon, she said, well stay then. But at that point on the way out the door, feeling totally humiliated, of course we weren't going to go back in.I pointed out that she had made us feel very uncomfortable and she said no i haven't.

1424,Robin Hood,Food,Bognor, Pub/Bar,4,Terrible Service,"We stayed at the attached Premier Inn, having been in the area attending a 21st birthday lunch, so the Robin Hood was the obvious choice for a light bite that evening.

We opted to have just sharer starters and dessert, but were there for two hours because the service was so slow - you would guess because it was a Saturday evening and therefore busy, but it was not and there were lots of empty tables (which surprised us because we'd booked a table online several days before and could only get 1815 or 2000, so had assumed everything else in between was already reserved).

However, the worst part for us was when we ordered a 0% Kopparberg cider for our 17 year old daughter mid-way through our visit. This was brought over by someone other than the waitress we'd placed the order with, and he immediately asked our daughter for ID. We questioned him and stated that it was a NO-Alcohol drink, assuming he hadn't realised that it wasn't a 'normal cider'; but he insisted on knowing their age stating that it still came under the same alcohol regulations - to which we advised him she was 17. He then said 'that's fine because even it was alcoholic there is no problem, as they could still be bought an alcoholic drink by an adult when eating in a restaurant' - by which time we really couldn't see the point in the whole conversation.....!!

Unfortunately, the episode had upset both our children, and our daughter left the restaurant after the starter not wanting to stay any longer and have a dessert. Our 12 year old son was absolutely stunned by the questioning, and kept repeating 'I don't understand, it was NO-Alcohol'.

We had no issue with the food served, but the service was appallingly slow - and the unnecessary questioning over what was essentially a mixed fruit squash left us all dumbfounded.

(For clarification, we looked into the ID issue after we left, and law only states that under 18's cannot buy or be served alcohol that has a content of 0.5% or more - this 'cider' was 0%, zero, nothing, null, nil - with the exception of a licenced premises serving food when a 16 or 17 year can then be bought an alcoholic beverage by an adult).

The only saving grace really was that we had a Tesco Clubcard voucher to cover the cost of the food, otherwise we would probably have left long before any of it was even served. Our bill left to pay came to a little over £11.00, but we were paying cash so ended up leaving the waitress with a £20 note and telling her to keep the change - as we dared not waste any more of our time waiting for her to come back with it!!

1441,Premier Inn Arundel,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,70,Shocking,"There is probably nothing wrong with the other rooms in this Premier Inn, however I will never forget my night of torture in room 111.
Upon opening the door the physical barrier of heat struck me like a Mike Tyson blow.
The curtains had been pulled, and the window had unfortunately been left open by whoever cleaned the room. This allowed it to become superheated, and the pedestal fan that had been left running at full pelt was vainly struggling to circulate the air. This produced the same effect of the a fan oven turned up to 10.
So I popped out after opening the window to the full 3 inches allowed by the security wires, to try cool the room.
Alas it was a vain hope, as the room took on the semblance of a Tennessee Prison sweatbox, and my night was reduced to a couple of hours of rolling from one puddle to another!

The welcoming booklet explains how the air conditioning system works, in a different hotel, with a different system. The control panel on the wall stated that this system could not cool the room.

All in all, I pity the poor cleaning lady that had to remove my sweat soaked sheets, pillows, and quite possibly mattress. Not an experience I shall want to repeat ever

1. I have poor sight and didn’t see it
2. The staff when serving should verbally warn you there’s a wait
3. When a customer complains in a good establishment they don’t just offer A weak half hearted apology. It would usually be met with a offer of a complementary drink to compensate for the wait while watching everyone else get their food before you ..
The only compensation was that the overpriced pie was very tasty, but it gave me heartburn because I ate it too fast.... because I was bloody starving !!!!!

There is always something to do for the little ones (our is turning 4 soon) and the whole resort is made for families. We stayed in a partial sea view room on the 4th floor, lifts were never busy (despite the hotel being busy!), the rooms were fantastic. Small bunk bed room for children with a night light, tv and pirate black out curtain - it’s the first time our daughter has wanted to stay in her own room on holiday, she usually prefers to stay in with us. Bathroom has a toddler seat on the toilet and a step for the sink, all these small touches go a long way. We opted for hotel dining (breakfast and dinner), the selection is plentiful and we’ve not had to wait for a table once. Restaurant staff make a great fuss of the children and the chefs are so friendly. Writing a letter to billie the bear and receiving a personal reply was a huge high point for our daughter! Ask at reception and they’ll give you the letterhead and envelope to post in the box. We had a problem with a leaky toilet, advised reception at 9am, by the time we popped to our room at 12pm it was fixed with a note to say so! Entertainment - loads of shows on (only saw the same one twice!). Billie and Bonnie the bears come for meet and greets to the hotel which were nice and quiet, no queue. Toddler archery was great fun too, and included. We didn’t make any evening entertainment as our daughter was exhausted by then. Rides - not a huge amount outside for shorter children, but that didn’t matter as there were a few she could go on and a few inside along with a big soft play. Pool - amazing! Only downside is I’m heavily pregnant and they wouldn’t let me poolside in clothes so I was unable to spectate but we’ll be back for a day pass once I’m able to go in as it looked great fun, my husband and daughter went in every day!The staff are fantastic here, they go out their way to make it special for everyone. They even grabbed me a chair to watch the puppet show on,which was great fully received being so heavily pregnant.

Unfortunately another customer then sees an empty free table and sits down and then realised it was dirty and sticky but no staff members to be seen as I suppose they had picked up some glasses so they could relax again and wait for more to appear. I note the management have made a previous comment that they are trying to get staff to wipe up. Please give them and apron with front pockets to carry a spray, cloth and wipes so they have no excuse not to think that if they pick up a glass they can clean at the same time so the next customer gets a seat at a clean table. Unfortunately the female staff member did her same nonchalant non caring practice at three different tables in 45 minutes between 6.30 and 7.15 last Friday. Shouldn’t be that hard to identify her??

We went into the garden to have drink and the garden was very pretty. However only very few of the rattan chairs had cushions on, and the glass table was absolutely filthy. We intended eating in the restaurant but this put us off and we went into the village instead.

The good points: the bedding was good quality, the towels fluffy, and whilst the breakfast was very basic, with limited choice, the eggs were very nicely poached.

This is a low-budget 2 star hotel with a 4 star label and even worse - 4 star prices. We paid £129 for one night for this sub-standard room!!!

This was disappointing as we both really prefer white meat. By the time we had queued for about 15 minutes my wife selected the last of the gammon so the choice was down to one! The service was very slow and at one stage the ""carver "" had to go to the back for more yorkshire puddings and we waited while a tray of around 24 portions were transferred laboriously one by one to the serving area. The beef I had was very pink and a bit fatty and gristly and about half the serving was virtually inedible and hard to chew.I am sorry to say the whole experience was very disappointing and we wished we had not decided to wait in a very slow moving queue for a lack lustre meal. We have been many times before for breakfast, meals and coffees but i think the whole management of the Sunday Carvery needs looking at. To be reduced to a choice of just beef by about 1.40 is very poor.

Also I appreciate it is wrong to judge a place on a single visit so allowances there too.

However the meal was the worst meal I have ever eaten - a platter of seafood - whitebait, scampi, calamari and ‘fish balls’.
Without thinking too deeply about it I ordered it with chips as well.

What arrived was a large plate of the items described and everything battered and fried plus a serving of very tired looking fried chips.
The mass of fried and battered items looked awful, was not that nice to eat and I left most fearing heartburn, indigestion and an upset stomach besides a calorie intake that should raise alarm bells.

Ok I was stupid ordering a completely ridiculous fried selection and badly balanced meal but it begs the question why was it on the menu in the first place?

I noted the remains of other similar ‘platters’ being left by other customers.
So nothing that could not be corrected by having menu selections that provided much more balanced and interesting courses rather than a awful unhealthy mass of fried food.",1,3.0,1.0,Seafood,1

Good stuff , staff as always , food choice and quality in the deck , waves hotel and our room , towel animals were a big plus , fairground soft play area and this time the circus was on

Not so good , deck restaurant was quite warm (even though it wasn’t warm outside)
Show seating , hard work trying to get decent seat.. Stephen mulhern pluging his magic set .. ( rest of show ok)

Poor - splash world , probably should be closed down and given a good clean , the changing rooms were dirty the first time it opened back in April ( were there 4 days after it opened ) and it’s got worse .. lots of peoples hairs all stuck on the floor yuk ! No sign of any cleaning . Also rides were open to anyone now 18 on the rock slide- not sure why

Will we go back ? Maybe if we got a really good deal or as day visitors.. would I go to the pool ? Not unless someone from Butlins assures me they are going to employee a better cleaning policy - this drags down the best of the rest yet is the newest attraction...

When it came to paying the bill, a senior member of staff deleted my regular cod off the bill as a gesture. He said the cod is sold by weight.

I messaged them through booking.com no one replied! I even rang the hotel from my mobile and no one answered.
An hour later after we where wide awake the music eventually got turned down but by then we where up!

I've eaten here several times but after said incident, my family and I will never return.

I ordered fish and chips and was given a receipt to which I placed in my pocket. The gentleman in question later shouted out ''pie, burger and chips'' directed at me, to which I stated was not my order. he then shouted ''what number'' and I said that I didn't understand.

Now, I've eaten there several times and have never been asked for a number. After a little while, I noticed that my receipt actually had a number on it, so I then presented this to him. The said gentlemen made some very sarcastic and rude comments saying ''this is why we give number to ticket, I say number you no stand there, you tell me number yes''. he continued to yell at me and I couldn't actually speak over the volume of his aggressive tone.

I requested that he is not rude to me and that it's wrong to belittle a customer and speak with sarcasm. I also stated that his tone was unprofessional and that he wasn't clear originally, which caused the confusion. Bizarrely, the gentleman started shouting at me regarding his disabled eye and I have no idea why or what he was trying to say.

I have never before been shouted at by a member of staff as a customer, nor spoken to with such rudeness. It's especially unreasonable because I never spoke out of turn or even raised my voice.

They once had an apple pie that had melt in the mouth pastry that was so delicious in so generous a portion that many people shared!
This obviously couldn't carry on it was too good value and totally eclipsed the other deserts so when it was taken off the menu l found two tasty alternatives the apple and pear crumble (more like a dinky little pie tbh)or a tasty little bannofee ensemble.
Today was my birthday and l selected the apple and pear but what a disappointment the crumble was like flakes of tasteless cake crumbs on top of apple that was either pretty raw or had not been defrosted.
When l complained l was told the chef said it has been changed and the apple is fine.

The room (411) dirty with hairs all over bathroom, carpets stained, luckily on complaint this was rectified quite quickly. We had hotel dining plan, avoid get dine around instead. the buffet consisted of a set menu every night only changing the meat option. My wife is a veggie this choice was almost non existent resorting to cheese and biscuits on third night luckily on complaint we were up graded free to the dine around option. Has any one from butlins been to lego land and seen a proper buffet? .
The pub and kitchen what a joke 25 minutes wait for dessert when mentioned to waitress she came out with lame excuse that the printer was,nt working in the kitchen
she should have realised no desserts were coming out and chased this, the dessert chef must have thought it was his lucky night being so quiet ., but worst of all the manager did,nt know what was going on. We had some side orders to pay for she got that bill wrong when rectified she could'nt work out the change £6 from £10 she had to be told by her manager.
Don,t bother queuing for rides just push in the ride operators won,t stop you.Their good at telling little ones they are to small but won,t say anything to queue jumpers (cowards). The same in the pool.
Now for the worst bit the pool is far to small for the size of the complex you are not allowed to ride the slides with your children having to stand around waiting. The cafe is separate so my non swimming wife had to sit on her own while we in the pool (thank god for costa).You cant get a drink in the pool area and chill out. The rapids are dangerous when you get to the bottom the water channels you in to the corner where there is a handrail waiting to catch the unwary. My son
 banged his head another gentleman split his forehead open and a young lad had some teeth knocked out .
There are numerous other niggles i could go into but i wont.
Overall we had a good holiday making the best of a bad week. my son enjoyed himself, the shows were funny, but we wont be going back to any butlins very quickly if ever. next year i,ll chance Disneyland Paris.

The hotel staff are excellent - friendly, professional and helpful and the food is very good ( especially the breakfasts). I have a slight niggle that the menu was the same for each of the 3 nights, but it was so delicious I didn’t mind having the lobster soup twice! So why only 4 stars? It’s about value. It is expensive and I think not quite luxurious enough for its high price tag. Our room ( a Sussex room so not the cheapest) was quite small, with hardly any storage but a lot of furniture making it feel cramped. The towels are quite small and the hairdryer cheap ( you have to keep your finger on the switch to keep it going). The bathroom is lovely but there was no shelf to put my toiletries. Having said all this - we loved our stay and will return.

Was told we're fully booked all night. No worries we'll go somewhere else. Hang on we'll fit you in. Found us a table that seats 7. 35 mins after ordering we're still waiting for our deserts and a round of drinks to arrive, but to be fair that has been the average for all the courses.
The food when it arrives is really nice, well cooked and presented well even if it is over priced.
The teenager that served us was excellent whilst the older lady was sullen and looked like we were an inconvenience to her.
If we were not staying at the premier inn would I think about using here again,

The starter of meatballs in tomato sauce consisted of 3 small meatballs costing nearly £5. The 4 thin slices of aubergine were also nearly £5.

1553,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,14,Property stolen from our room,"Stayed here 8th - 12th July 2019. This is the second year we have visited the resort. The rooms are in desparate need of a refresh but the new pool was great and that is what we have given the 1 star for. The reason for my negative review is the customer service we received after we left. Our 1 year old was sick so we rushed home and left 1 bag of our items in the electric cupboard. So as soon as we realised I attempted to call guest services. This alone took over 48 hours to get through to them. Finally I have spoken to 3 different people and was promised a call back by 12 noon once the cleaners had checked the cupboard for me. 12noon comes no call so I asked the lady when I can expect a call or call back myself. She then told me 4pm but this is when the new guests check in surely the room could be checked at 11am when the previous guests left or whilst they were there give them a curtesy knock to ask to check the electric cupboard? So I call back at 2pm to find out that our stuff has indeed been stolen which amounts to just over £300 plus a bank card. So disappointing as should this have been dealt with promtly and efficiently we could have got our stuff back. Will not reccomend butlins to anyone nor book another holiday with them.

What did I get back within less than a minute but another sandwich with a thin top slice and 2 holes in it. Told the lad it was the same sandwich and he said they had replaced with new bread.
No apology from him.. took it straight back to the ordering point and said I'm not eating that.

Had to explain to her that an apology would have been nice.
Received a refund which I didn't ask for as thought I'd return the compliment with a trip advisor review.

Go into the place and i was the only person there other than an elderly gent, door open on a cold day, tried to shut door which was stuck open. Music playing in the back kitchen where the host (presume Vicky) was at doing nothing in particular. Eventually she came to the front, no hello, no smiley face just a miserable attitude. I ordered a bacon sandwich and a cup of tea. I asked politely for ketchup on the sandwich, then informed “it’s on the table”. I asked for strong tea without sugar, to be told abruptly “sugar on the table and the bag’s left in to sort myself”. It cost £3.50, I only had a £10 note and was rudely asked if I had smaller. I said no and offered a card, then got change and sat at the table. Then the other gent got up and ordered, same attitude and when he asked for crispy bacon was told “obviously that’s going to take longer”.
After a while and relative silence in the restaurant area and muffled music from the back, my sandwich was delivered (nearly thrown on the table). Dry old bread, under cooked bacon and cheap Margarine. Someone else came in during my stay to check if they were open as he’d tried on two previous days to get in and they were shut. He was given such attitude by this lady that I’d be surprised if he came back with his 5 friends, I wouldn’t have and certainly won’t be going back there again.

Bearing in mind we were about to spend over £100 for lunch. We then left and parked in the road free.
We then went back in to get a coffee while waiting for our friends. The barman looked like we had asked for something unusual ( 2 Americanos), he went across the courtyard as that was where the coffee machine was!
Our friends arrived and the waiter was hovering waiting for us to take our place at our table, this was now about 1pm, the restaurant was completely empty! We were surprised as it was Sunday lunch. We were then told that some of the choices on the menu were not available, the roast only included chicken or Pork Belly(not what you would expect on a Sunday no Roast Beef!). However the food was ok really nothing that exceptional.
Where were all the people, very soulless, heated by a fan heater although they did have an open fire! After time a couple came in for lunch and another for a cream tea.

first off some of the staff were amazing and I hope this review dosen't put the place in much of a bad light, but at the same time let me explain why it was not a good holiday for us.
First of all the ""schedule"" compared to CP yes there are activities which are scheduled... BUT dose the pool have to be so ridged in its times during a tots week? CP are open all day every day with food and drink available... with a swimming mad son... and this being his only really love at the place it gave us little to do the rest of time...
You might be think ahh there are shows.. rides, slot machines, activities, stuff to do around the park... well... Not for us..
Son didn't like the rides, didn't like the shows and the slot machines (which I really wasn't happy with... introduce your child to gambling... emmmmmm...) 30 mins at the most of entertainment. The winter break and constant rain meant we were stuck inside the resort and thus we exhausted the craft activity was left craving to go home. The one show we did take him too ended up scaring him...
He could not go on the big soft play because of the height restriction
The bed was dirty on arrival (They changed it right away)
The pool changing area could have offered overshoes.
We ended up coming home early and little one was sick and then my husband and I came down with it 2 days later...
Having been to CP both UK and Belgium they seem to offer less yet we get so much more out of the holiday. Maybe its because we really don't like that type of entertainment. I have left feedback with them... we had a reply, which they didnt address my issue over the gambling aspect of the site. wont be going there again.

However, it really seems to have gone downhill. Stood in a queue of about 9/10 today whilst one person was taking orders. The other person decided to put glasses away and ignored the queue.
Tables outside had not been cleared and cleaned - We used our own water to clean our table.
Waited nearly 30 mins for a Burger and Pie. I had to check how much longer we had to wait and was told it would be out of the kitchen next . And as if by magic it was.
Then the real disappointment the Wagyu burger was done to a crisp - I mean really well done. We asked the waitress to take a look at how well done the burger was. She told us that it was the company policy to server burgers ""well done"" and she walked off without further debate.
The ""company"" should visit The Gribble Inn to see how a burger should be cooked and served.
The pie was good but carrots were sad and cabbage (assumed cabbage) was good to death and had little flavour. A couple of pictures attached.

When we got accommodation in one of the Sofas had a big rip in it. They did change it, but the mess underneath it was revolting, peanuts and general rubbish. Seems to the refurbishment is new carpet.
Swimming pool is a paddling pool, just a small adult area to actually swim in water past your knees.
The whole experience was a waste of money. You can buy pass passes for £15 to get into entertainment, but unless you want to sit in there for 2 hrs before anything starts then don’t bother.
Certainly won’t ever return.

Not really my problem and to be honest it wasn't that busy. Another waitress came in duty at 6.30. One of the chefs was actually serving food to customers. Finally after 40 minutes the waitress came to take our food order and still no drinks!! She finally bought one pint over which turned out to be flat.

THEY REALLY MUST HATE VISITORS THERE. Other areas we found lots of yellow lines.. So in the end we gave up and drove out of it, after all you either want the custom or you don't and with a huge potential of caravan visitor income they have turned their noses up. We were 2 older people not some sort of riff raff and from what we experience Haven site is alot better than another well known firm who can have lots of nasty finds. Often we are seeing that where there is a caravan site for holidays the areas seem to be run down, question which came first. It is odd that when we came this way before we went west of Pagham for days out and they did not want us in those places either. one place it wanted £10 to park it began with W. so we turned the car around and got out fast.

There was no decent curry but a medley of vegetable based dishes that all tasted much the same, i.e. bland with no authentic flavour at all. The rice was cold as were some of the main dishes. We asked about drinks and were told there was only apple juice or tap water. I tried hard to eat my meal but in the end left most of it.

We both fancied a dessert; at first the waitress said that the chef wasn't doing desserts as he wanted to concentrate on the curry (Which was fair enough.) but then came over to our table a little later to say that the chef was now doing desserts. I went for the cheesecake and my wife went for ice cream; both of which went down a treat.

The quiz was good fun and one of the better quiz's we've been too in the area. We'll definitely be back for more Black Horse quiz night's, other commitments permitting.

We stayed in the upgraded rooms with the four poster bed and it was absolutely incredible. So comfortable and just nice touches like homemade cookies for you. The food was outstanding. We had the dinner deal and chose from the better menu at an extra cost. The food was absolutely amazing, the drinks were great. I had the recommended English sparkling and it didn’t disappoint! The spa is very nice and on a weekend after 11:00 it was lovely a quiet. We both had the mediterranean massage which was an hour and a half and just glorious. If we didn’t have a life and no where to go we would have happily stayed in the spa all day. Couldn’t recommend this place just for a nice weekend or night off. However it comes at a hefty price.

Very quickly we were asked to order and then twice after that, each time saying no we weren’t ready. Staff were hovering behind us it was clear they wanted us to order. Had chicken satay and dumplings to start. Chicken was ok but dumplings were the worst we’d ever had, hard and dry.
Starter plates were cleared and I still had food in my mouth eating. Was wondering what the rush was and then I realised, the other waitress was stood behind with our mains. Hated this as had no break in between starters and mains and again it was made apparent there was a rush.
I had ordered what was meant to be a very very mild curry. It still had chillies in and was too hot to eat. Maybe the reason for this was that the waitress wasn’t even making eye contact when taking our order and was in a rush?
One waitress asked why I hadn’t touched the curry and we explained it was too hot to eat more than a mouthful. Rather than helping she walked away?!!!
When our plates were cleared another waitress apologised and told us we wouldn’t be charged for it. Very kind and we did appreciate this. But she said to mention it earlier in the future and they could have changed my meal. (We had mentioned it earlier and this didn’t happen).
Bill came and there was an automatic 10% service charge on there. Something we would have refused to pay had they not taken the curry off in good gest.

Overall we were in and out in 1 hour, nearly £80 down. That is not what we expect when you save to go for a celebratory meal.

The menu is advertised as ""Premier Inn"" and as such you would expect a similar standard - no such luck, We eagerly went down to breakfast to discover a buffet type set up. Cold bacon, over cooked cold sausages, scrambled eggs etc. No bubble and squeak, no poached eggs. All available food was put on to cold plates resulting in a very disappointing breakfast.

That evening we decided to try the evening menu, again the same as our local ""Premier Inn"", why oh why did we bother - we had booked a table for 7.30pm, went down at 7.30 to discover they had given our table away!! We took a table in the bar as offered without making any fuss, were handed menus and told of 2 items unavailable, Hubby made his choice - cod and chips and I made mine - chicken in a basket only to be told ""Oh sorry thats not available"" Made a 2nd choice ""Oh thats not available either"" - and my 3rd choice was unavailable too!! By this time I had lost the will to live and went for gammon roast, 2 very small slices of gammon 3 awful soft roast potatoes and mixed veg arrived with a yorkshire pudding you could have used as a ping pong bat!! NOT GOOD! My husbands fish was not much better, grey looking cod with soggy batter - the triple cooked chips were the only saving grace. I felt very sorry for our waitress as she knew it was not good - she offered us free desserts which we accepted as we were starving. Mine was delicious (chocolate and raspberry torte) my husbands vanilla ice cream was ok too!

Our actual Premier Inn room was lovely, clean tidy and as you would expect, but you really need to sort out the restaurant side of things - we were advised by the grumpy restaurant manager that the restaurant was a different business to the hotel, but in my eyes it is endorsed by Premier Inn and should be a much higher standard.

So we made a reservation and returned 45 minutes later and was sat straight down and was told waitress would be over shortly. 10 minutes later we had to ask the manager if we could order drinks as no one had been over! We waited nearly another 10 minutes for the bar maid to come over and say they didn't have the wine I ordered. Our food order was taken and we asked for starters first. Went with the music wheel for my partner, 2 year old and I to share. It was really disappointing for such a long wait. Half an hour went by with staff sweeping the floor and cleaning empty tables around us when our plates hadn't been cleared. We heard the people around us complaining about the wait. It wasn't busy at this point so there was no excuse. It was getting closer to 7 o'clock and the table behind us obviously wanted to get the the show and had to ask for their dessert to go. My partner had to go up to the bar to ask our waitress for another drink. She never passed the order to the bar maid so he had to go up again. Our waitress walked past and we had to ask her to clear the table. It was like we had asked her to lick the table not just move the empty plates that had been there half an hour. Our 2 year old after being strapped in to a high chair for an hour was getting really tetchy so we had to ask for our food to be taken away.
It really ruined our night because we actually looked forward to trying the diner and actually spent the most money here out of all the other places. The food was also really poor considering we were only waiting for hot dog and chips. My partner had the chilli dog which had basically no chilli on it. The bread rolls were dry and split. We ordered extra coleslaw at about £2.50. The waitress failed to mention both our meals came with coleslaw so we didn't actually need it. When the bill came they tried to charge me for the more expensive wine I ordered thay they didn't have! We complained to the manager on the way out about the poor service and we may as well not have bothered. Her response was 'I don't know what's happened there.'

1676,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,4,Discriminating behaviour towards my little girl by a lady staff member named HAYLEIGH at Butlins Bognor Regis Resort,"On our 2nd night at the resort, we attended a family event at the Reds venue where we had a very nasty experience with a red coat staff member named HAYLEIGH. She singled out my 5 yr old girl and stopped ONLY her from taking a picture with the Mr. Potato head character.
When I saw my little girl close to tears I approached HAYLEIGH and requested politely to grant her just one picture as she was the last child in line. I would have understand if there were more children behind her and all asked to leave but to ask just the last child out??? I was told rudely by her that they had already done the countdown to end the photo shoot and that ‘ I should have used my ears to listen better’ !!!! She also said that instead of dancing with my little son on the dance floor,I should have ‘paid more attention to the queue’.
I was extremely shocked at her condemning manner and reminded her that after the countdown five other white families had stood in the queue in front of my girl and had been granted a picture and why was she, the only one to be left out? Also, what does me dancing with my son have anything to do with my daughter who was waiting her turn patiently in the queue????
What is worse is that my daughter had only joined the queue (after the countdown) once I checked with the male photographer there. He later denied any responsibility saying that he was just there to take pictures! When I reminded HAYLEIGH that such an attitude towards a guest and a child was not acceptable, she very arrogantly pointed to her name tag and asked me to report to whoever I liked, it made no difference to her! She spent about 2-3 mins arguing with me and the Mr Potato head character remained in the background but she couldn’t use a minute of that time to make a little girl happy????

We have been to many other family resorts and have never experienced anything like this. In fact, most other places go out of their way to make the little ones feel special. We were initially very impressed by the Butlins resort, the ocean hotel room, the pool zone and entertainment shows where we did see friendly and attentive staff like the hotel receptionist Kirstie and most staff at the pavilion arcade. I am surprised that someone like this lady Hayleigh works in a resort of this stature as she definitely has a problem with brown/dark skin and clearly does not know how to communicate with guests.
I strongly condemn such obnoxious and discriminating behaviour in a place that claims to be dedicated to families and fun. As parents we did not spend our hard earned money, for our daughter to feel inadequate and reduced to tears just before her birthday! (she didn’t want to attend most character events at the resort after that). We checked out of the resort a day earlier than needed and must say that we have been extremely disappointed by Butlins on this occasion.

I was also told that I would have to wait a further 2 or 3 days before I got my money back, so roughly by Sunday 21st July. Seeing as I've planned a break commencing from Monday 22nd July this leaves hardly any time to book another break using my original holiday fund.
During the phone call I asked if it was ok for a married couple with no children to go on a Butlins break and was told that it was ok for married couples of opposite sex but same sex couples would need to prove they are married. On that basis it would be interesting to know if an unmarried, opposite sex couple, would have any booking problems.
The fact that it's in their terms and conditions doesn't change the fact that it's discrimination and, let's face it, how many single people would read the terms & conditions to find out if they had to be accompanied by a child.
Conclusion: If you are single or gay then Butlins don't think you're safe to be around children.

When we arrived at the apartment we started to unpack the few groceries we had brought with us - I felt quite queasy as the dining table started to move (unstable). everywhere felt sticky and the veneer (if you can call it that) had started to peel off. My grandson's white socks soon became very dirty and slipper bottoms were tacky. We could hardly get into the bathroom (you almost had to get into the shower to get through the door) and we had to call out maintenance twice as the contents of the toilet and sink would not empty and started to fill up. The outside drains had to be rodded. Our front door would not shut properly on a couple of occasions and the windows of the rooms were very poor - condensation and we could not leave the window on the catch to ventilate and the lounge window hinge was buckled. Our friends also had a similar appartment and they left a day early (there were 3 in their group but 6 in ours). We did have a power cut which took out most of the surrounding area and I have to say the staff in the fish restaurant were a delight and kept reasuring us (fortunately we ordered before the power went off so we got our meal). I have already been in touch with a higher authority to complain but I felt I was being patronised and it was if the lady who responded was pacifing me with answers off a script. There was no offer of compensation only that if we were to go again they could offer a discount (we could probably get that by booking on line anyway). It has totally put me off Butlins and sad to say that my 3 year old grandson will probably miss out on family visits like this in the future - there must be other wonderful sites out there.

1704,"The Windmill, Harvester",Food,Littlehampton, Pub/Bar,5,Absolute Shocker wish I’d read the reviews,"Waited 7 mins to be greeted. I don’t time these things but I was looking at the time on my phone when we got in there. Think about that. 7 minutes standing there hoping someone would at least give us a nod, let alone approach us with an 82yr old and 2 small overheating thirsty girls. Totally unacceptable and I should have left then but the girls were hungry and it was my 82yr old mums birthday. What a treat she got, not.

When the server finally came over she sternly asked if we’d booked (as though it was unlikely we’d get a place)? It was 5:45pm, hello.

The restaurant was half empty by the way so id dread to think what it’s like when it’s busy. Unless you have the patience of a saint id avoid this place. I’ve come here on and off for years when invited by others and although the food has improved, it’s more expensive than it used to be but there’s always a problem either with hygiene, sticky tables, rude staff (not today though, they just didn’t get near us), poor supply to the salad bar, etc.

30 mins after being seated we were given no salad bowls but more importantly we were parched but STILL NO drinks on the hottest day of the year, so no rehydrating my 4 and 6 yr old in sweltering heat. 30 minutes after ordering with not even the jug of water that we ordered is unacceptable in that heat. When I finally had enough I wandered up and got my own jug at the bar. Intriguingly it had a big bite mark chunk out the side of the skanky worn out water jug. It should have been in the bin. Oh and they don’t have any ice on the hottest day in summer!!! Basil Faulty runs this place, surely?

No tomatoes or cucumbers in the salad bar just a watery mess where they once lived. Loads of sauces to choose from but it was a lucky dip as none were labelled running the risk of giving your child chilli sauce instead of ketchup or relish.

We ate the cut-down salad off little side plates as nobody gave us bowls so we improvised with what was there. My mum only had salad bar as she’s elderly so her whole meal was on a tiny side plate! Disgraceful.

After being left to fend for ourselves I cleared the finished salad plates myself in the end and put them on the tray I got from the bar when I went to serve myself and my family that jug of water.

As a side note I took my little one to the men’s bathroom. She’s kicked off her sandals under the table in the heat but I hadn’t realised. She then walked into the toilet and walked in urine leaking from the urinals. They had put out of a sign to say wet floor but it was puddles of wee all over the bathroom everywhere so my little princess had walked through lots of pee to get from the cubicle to the sinks, the poor little mite. It should have been mopped up or locked up.

Nobody asked how the food was, we weren’t offered any more drinks (not that they arrive anyway) despite it being sweltering. We didn’t get spoken to by anyone in that whole time since ordering food and due to the continued lack of staff I eventually had to go up and stand at the tills and interrupt a member of staff in order to actually pay the bill and get the hell out of there.

I noticed on the wall above the till it said something like “remember, no more bad reviews like the one from D.L” with a big arrow pointing towards it or something similar so it’s not as if they don’t know they need to buck up their ideas. To be fair the 2 people I encountered at the till were kind and apologetic. I wasn’t one of their tables but you could see they were frustrated and working under pressure in what seemed like a sinking ship so I did have sympathy for them. Very poorly managed though I’m afraid and lots of customers looked disgruntled. More staff and someone in maintenance to sort the bathroom, ice machine, I’ve cream machine is what’s needed.

The simple food took 45 minutes to arrive which is way too long in a half empty restaurant. Other restaurants set your expectations if there’s a long wait over 20 mins.
The food itself was ok when it arrived but I just wanted to get out of there by that point. I’d have to be desperate to go back there

Room only - very basic, a bit cold when we stayed in February, no room service and no area to dry clothes from swimming or rain! It is the UK after all!!

Hotel rooms, we have stayed in all three hotels. We prefer the Wave hotel as we pay for higher level rooms with balconies, albeit you have to pay a lot more these rooms they are bigger and you don't have lots of kids running past the doors. This hotel has a games room on the ground floor to keep the older kids a bit more occupied.

Bognor Butlins has changed since we first went, it has been upgraded a lot and the prices have reflected this. The new swimming pool is good fun but gets crowded.

My kids have started to grow out of the fairground and the activities. If you have younger kids 10yrs and under then they will love it. Older kids will get bored.

My first suggestion would be to inform people as their seated what dishes you don’t have, rather than wait for them to decide to order and then let them know then. As not having crab (my first choice) and then another fish dish (my second choice)..
Other tables spent a while deciding as did we to then be told you didn’t have the dishes.
Also I really have to say that serving scallops on a piece of brioche is bizarre, so so sickly as was the over bearing sweet jam with so much ginger in. Just a really disappointing dish for £11!
The roast dinners could have been alright if the beef wasn’t overcooked and hadn’t been swamped in the ridiculous amount of almost jelly like gravy, also couldn’t make out what the white sauce was on the plate initially I thought horseradish or bread sauce but it literally was just a tasteless white sauce floating in the gravy.

We learnt a lot about Arundel and would definitely recommend this tour to anyone who is planning to visit!

My friend and I decided on a ploughmans each at the Black Rabbit but it was disappointing. The rocket had wilted, spring onion was the outside throwaway shell, celery again outside section, unwashed so too chewy, bread roll not crusty or warm and salad a little sad as though it'd been sitting around. When we told the waitress she never replied and when paying for it we were asked again if we'd enjoyed it, we said no. No reply, no queries, nothing. We only saw student bar staff and no one appeared to be in charge so did anyone care enough to feed back our disappointment?

We did tell the receptionist when we left who firstly said it was just a days dust which that would could have accepted, but this was months of dust, which was totally unacceptable, she apologised and made a note.

Breakfast was delicious and a very generous portion. We also loved the two very friendly dogs. The only reason that I’ve left 4 instead of 5 stars is that the room just needs a little bit of work. The room is advertised as a king bed, but we’re fairly sure it was a double (however we didn’t have to pay extra for this, so not too fussed).

Food is ok, though they do not have anything like it is stated on the menu. The main courses like lamb shank, salmon is spotless, great, but the side dish is not what you order. With none of the orders. They provide a few vegan food, but more then half of it they ran out. (On a Sunday it means the restaurant is not prepared for guests.) It is hard for a vegan person.
Not mentioning the problems with the coffee.
Payment is complicated f you want to share the bill with your friends. Basically a menu is thrown to you and calculate and figure it out on your own what you ordered and need to pay.

The only problem was the service received - the restaurant clearly has a lot of loyal customers that are very kissy kissy with the female manager. This is fine and is typically a sign of a good restaurant - however it isn’t great when you are treated differently to them. For example, on arrival we asked for a cock tail menu and were told no cocktails on a Sunday. I have been before just for drinks on a Sunday and enjoyed an espresso martini and also a pornstar martini so was surprised to hear they weren’t available. I then noticed the table next to us had almost empty pornstar martinis (including the Prosecco glass) and the table that arrived after us (kissed the manager) and were given cocktails...
The staff weren’t very attentive even leaving our empty glasses on our table for the duration of the meal, we were practically stacking them at the end. Our plates took ages to clear also.

They don’t have gluten free bread which is quite unacceptable these days with over 1 in 100 people affected by a gluten intolerance or allergy so I watched my husband enjoy his bread whilst I waited for my starter...

1757,Swan Hotel,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,50,"Not worth the money for an ""indulgence room""","Didn't feel ""indugent"" at all! The walls and paint were scuffed. The double bed was two single divans pulled together so you slipped down the middle of the two of them. No bath, only a bare windowless shower room with lino on the floor. It is stated that not all rooms have a bath but the bathroom itself was tatty, with a cracked sink and toilet lid. Decor was more plain than stripped back. The furniture was stained with other people drinks. No minibar or fridge.

Positives - The room was clean. The bed was comfy if you didn't go close to the middle! A complimentary bottle of Proseco as it was our anniversary. The pub is excellent and the staff and breakfast both faultless. The fault does not lie with the staff or their hospitality. Fresh milk for tea in the room.

It was a large and okay b&b type room but lacked a level of polish that I would expect at this price. I felt mis-sold by Fullers, the room I got is only featured in one of their photographs (and only on the separate booking companies website) whilst the rest of their rooms look far more ""indulgent!""

Staff were all very pleasant and the breakfast was good - but for £179, definitely not the stylish and pretty standard experience I have previously experienced with the Hilton chain. I'll check the reviews more carefully next time. I suggest that you avoid rooms 1-42 which are in the neglected part of the building.

The hotel itself is fine, the staff friendly, the breakfast always brilliant, BUT... and it’s a big BUT! The last several times I’ve stayed here the fire Alarm has gone off at very unsociable times of the night. Sometimes more than once. When I stay away for work it’s because I need to be fresh the next day & saves me commuting for 2 hours from Bournemouth. I don’t know why the Fire Alarms keep going off, but I always get told by reception when I have a moan “that someone smoked in the room or a shower set it off”. Last night was the same & is probably the final straw for me in terms of staying at the Norfolk Arms.

I’ve never had any offer of compensation on the numerous occasions it has happened & the bigger concern for me now, is that I take it for granted that it’s not an actual fire, I don’t even get out of bed for these alarms. so one day a fire may actually occur and any frequent stayers will probably just ignore it.

Great shame because if it wasn’t for this I’d easily give it a 4 out of 5.

1796,Royal Norfolk,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,65,Needs an update,"Stayed for 2 nights, on the plus side the check in was easy and the receptionist was informative and polite, unfortunately this is pretty much were the plus(s) end..

The room was large enough and was clean, the carpet could do with being renewed and had an iron mark by the end of the bed. There was only 2 tiny bars of soap, no shampoo / conditioner etc. There was instant coffee and tea but no bottled water.

The breakfast was an experience, we arrived to an almost empty dining area and the waitress wanted to seat us by a window in direct sunlight and almost on top of a couple of gentlemen on the table next to us, the tables were so close. The waitress said she would have to ask her manager to change our table . . . The dining area was empty???

The manager appeared and said they had a coach party and they had allocated tables. OK, but we are paying guest too! She reluctantly moved us to another table and we ordered breakfast. Breakfast arrived, the toast was cold and brittle (been made a while) and I had a long hair in my baked beans, I did not eat the breakfast and asked the waitress to take it away, I was offered a replacement, but declined.

We left for a day out and on our return our key card did not work, but it was ok because our room was OPEN!!! This was the last straw, out all day with our belongings unsecured, all my work files, personal documentation! I went to reception and informed the receptionist who said she would speak with the housekeeping manager in the morning.

I did mention to the nice young lady on the outside bar that it might be an idea if someone could clear the tables (?) This didn't happen - so we cleared one of the booths ourselves and put it all on an other adjacent table. Still no one came to clear/clean the tables. We ordered some tapas style food for all of us to share but it took an age to arrive and they also brought out the wrong items. Also, there were no plastic wine glasses at the outside bar so I had to drink my lovely Sauvignon Blanc from a plastic beer cup, awful, and no Fruit Shoots for the kids - come on guys, it was the hottest day of the year, loads of familes around, sort it out.

1803,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,60,Lovely Location - Tatty Hotel,"Where to begin – this is definitely not the standard of hotel synonymous with the Hilton Brand, in my opinion it is the worst Hilton I have stayed in to date! The hotel is in desperate need of a major refurb, the creaking floorboards threadbare carpets and scruffy walls in the corridors are very off putting. The building itself is charming and with some serious investment it could be a lovely venue. Our room had recently been painted and although small was generally clean – I did, however make the mistake of looking out of the window to find that the windowsill was filthy and covered in dust & cobwebs – which was a shame as the rest of the room was fine. There are also no lifts available so if you have mobility issues be sure to request a room on the ground floor. There was no air-con in our room, although there was a very noisy metal fan supplied, so it was a toss up as to whether the heat or the noise kept you awake at night. The reception staff on check in were very helpful and efficient – not so good on check-out (different staff) who seemed to be struggling with the busy period. We also found the bar staff to be very helpful and friendly – but the drinks are over priced – £12.50 for a large glass of Sauvignon Blanc! The biggest shambles was definitely breakfast time – we headed down at 08.45 and there was a very long queue, we were eventually seated at a table – only to be moved on by a very angry customer when he returned from fetching his breakfast a few minutes later – so back to the desk to wait for another available table, without so much as an apology from the lady who sat us down in the first place! It was a very hit and miss affair with some tables being offered teas & coffees and others being left to fend for themselves. Admittedly it was a very busy breakfast session, but the wait for certain hot items (eggs/bacon/sausages) was ridiculously long, the remaining items were congealing on your plate before the stocks were replenished, and when I asked a member of staff how much longer the wait would be, I was informed by her that it wasn’t her department so I would just have to wait as one of her colleagues would deal with it! After a wait of over 45 minutes (from initially queuing) we decided that enough was enough, and left without bothering. We would have complained there and then but couldn't find anyone to complain to - and after the attitude of the member of staff we did talk to anout the food issues, we thought we'd be wasting our breath anyway. This Hilton was terrible value for money, and to be honest I have stayed in better budget hotels, definitely one I will avoid in future!

1816,Travelodge Fontwell,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,52,ABSOLUTELY FILTHY,"This was my first and last trip to a Travelodge. We arrived and despite ringing the bell waited ages for someone to check us in. Our room was filthy - all surfaces were sticky and the bathroom floor was sticky and black - it should have been blue but you could hardly see that. The taps were filthy the sink wasn’t clean and the soap dispensers were empty.
We were there 2 days and saw no one on the reception at all until we checked out so were unable to complain - we were here for a busy social weekend so did not have much time. The only time we saw a member of staff during our stay, he was sitting on the steps outside chatting to someone who was sitting smoking and he had no interest in customers.
Very helpful lady on the Sunday as we checked out and she offered us a refund straight away but said she could not process it and someone would ring me at 3pm that day. Of course no one did. The next day a lady rang and she agreed how dirty the room was - she said he had personally bleached the floor ‘several times’ after our stay as it was so dirty.
She offered us a full refund for the 2 days but said another customer wanted to check in so she would call me back. She called back and said that her head office had refused the refund as we had paid such a high rate for the room - 250 pounds for 2 nights. That was not our fault that is what they charged us - and surely an agreement that someone should not pay should not be dependent on what they paid.
W contacted the head office who advised us that the manager (a man - even though we spoke to a lady who said she was the manager) had already agreed with us that they would only give us a 50% refund, and that it had already been processed on their system as us having agreed. This is totally untrue - we never spoke to a man and the lady offered us a full refund and blamed head office. Just a big bunch of lies to fob us off. No wonder the staff are so slack and couldn’t care less when the head office are setting the same example.
One good point was the lady at reception when we checked out, charming and helpful - she should leave there she doesn’t fit in with the other hapless staff

I lightheartedly wished her luck trying to get it back off him, and he carried on similar banter with the waitress as he had been doing with his brother (he is 6!).

1830,Sea View,Accommodation,Littlehampton,Hotel,41,Really very poor,"This is a rather belated review of our visit to the Sea View Pub/Hotel in East Preston on Easter Saturday, a few weeks ago. The review is in respect of the pub not the hotel itself – we live nearby so were just visiting for lunch and drinks.
It was our first visit and I have to say was disappointing in the extreme. We had in fact called in a few months previously after walking into East Preston and the barman had shown us the menu which included a fish platter (I can not remember the exact words or description).
However, when we arrived on Easter Saturday, we were told that with the exception of the plaice, they had no other fish at all (a fish platter was not on the menu but that is fair enough I guess as menus do change). We sat down with a drink and perused the menu and further disappointment arrived when we went to order.
As well as no “ordinary” fish they did not even have fish fingers for a sandwich and when I ordered ham was told “It’s still being cooked”.
We therefore settled on two x plaice and two x warm chicken and bacon salad.
It must be said that my wife and her brother who had the plaice described it as delicious (and that is the only thing that saved this from being a one star review). However the chicken and bacon salad were woefully lacking in either chicken or bacon!! Really poor.
With the exception of the barman (I think called Jamie) the rest of the people serving or hovering round the bar, who I think were the owners were all rather aloof and certainly not particularly welcoming.
To summarise, the two plaice meals were excellent, the service was not great and to have so many dishes unavailable at lunchtime on Easter Saturday is unforgivable (the pub was quiet at that stage so it was not because they had served lots before we arrived).
I can not comment on the hotel/bedrooms as we did not see them – I would add, however, that the stairway to the top of the building can be seen when accessing the toilets and the walls have peeling wallpaper and look distinctly unappealing.

1837,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,110,Goodbye Bognor,"This is my third consecutive holiday with Butlins, for the last 2 years we’ve stayed at Skegness and we’ve not been disappointed by our stays there.

This year we decided to stay at Bognor Regis instead, we fancied a change of scenery and having previously been to Minehead many years ago it was about time we tried out Bognor so we could compare all three resorts.

Well let me tell you from our personal experience Bognor isn’t the place to be. So where do I begin...

Well checkin was very chaotic. Given rough directions where to drive round to in order to check in and got a bit confused by this. No one around to direct you. When we got to the checkin area it’s a small round room where everyone does the British thing of queuing around the room and out the door. While the process was fairly smooth it was chaotic you couldn’t hear yourself think with so much going on.

3pm it was time to go to our room, on arrival it seemed to be okay but then we realised it wasn’t up to scratch. Hairs in the bathroom sink, shower was dirty, wrappers left behind bedside cabinets, dirt on the floor in the bedrooms. Not impressed. Back to the checkin desk where the lovely lady there I think called Tracie who was great arranged for housekeeping to come back. Literally 15 minutes later a lovely cleaner arrived and was shocked at the state of the rooms. She did an amazing job and the accommodation was spotless. However as we used the accommodation we noticed more problems. Bulbs out in various rooms, bathroom extractor fan not working etc. Back to checkin and Tracie again got it dealt with.

The next day we took a trip to Splash world. Lots of singing and dancing about how it’s all brand new etc. Bit disappointing from an adults point of view. Lots of rides for kids but only 2 for adults excluding the 1 family ride and no where really to have a proper swim. The wave pool had to be shut twice due to metal bars coming loose and floating into the pool. Considering this is brand new it’s rather shocking. Half the changing rooms where blocked off too and while this is great there is a machine to dry your swim wear only 1 was working so queues for that. Yes I get it’s a family place etc but it’s all catered really for young children and teens. Surly a decent thing would of been to refurbish the old pool and have both?

That same evening there was a major power cut in Bognor and while this isn’t something Butlins can do much about, staff where running around like headless chickens not knowing what to do. You’d think a resort this size would have backup generators to even just supply main lighting to main buildings and accommodation but clearly not. I get it’s not something Butlins can control but communication could of been better. As a result of the power failure our evening meal was a no go but Butlins gave us £30 of vouchers to use on restore which was a nice touch. Thanks to DJ in guest services.

Other niggles, shower in the room is like a trickle of water, maintenance replaced the shower head but no change. Towels are only replaced with clean ones on Wednesdays and Sundays (Unlike Skegness where it’s daily and more are given if asked, though I asked for more it was a struggle). Layout of the whole place is a bit poor so much waking to get to/from accommodation to entertainment etc.

We met a lovely couple at Bognor Regis too who where staying at the Shoreline Hotel. They also had problems with leaking toilet, bulbs out etc and maintenance had to go to their room multiple times so it appears the general maintenance of the camp is very poor.

And where do I start on the entertainment. Reds was closed so only entertainment really was on Centre Stage and it was a bit piss poor really. Elton John, ABBA etc while all great music it’s sung by the same people each night. Just an excuse to save money I guess by using in house singers who can’t give a proper performance. Really poor performance here Butlins.

Best part of the entertainment was the Panto. 10/10 really funny and a great laugh for all the family. Have seen them over the last 3 years and they’ve all been amazing!

Overall it’s not the best out of the 3 sights, personally I think Skegness has the upper hand over all 3 resorts. I’d rather go to Minehead or Skegness in the future. While I’ve booked next years break on resort with the lovely Sarah who i must add was great during our stay helping us with our booking for next year and even our assisting guests during the power failure, my stay won’t be here at Bognor. My stay is booked for Skegness.

Thanks Bognor you’ve been well ummm... not great.

Also for note Bognor town seemed rubbish no decent arcades or shops for rock etc open in October a week before half term! Seemed like a ghost town.

1845,Church Farm,Accommodation,Littlehampton,AccomOther,3,Accommodation Perfect,"When booking a caravan at this site, i had no idea which one to go for as iv never stayed at any Haven site before. Middle of August, everything was overpriced so my only option was to take a standard caravan. Im glad to report it was 90% perfect!

Upon entering reception to check in, i was offered for an additional £60 the opportunity to upgrade to a deluxe caravan. Although the offer sounded tempting, after already paying so much i wasnt interested in paying anymore. At that stage i wasnt sure if i had made a mistake but upon entering the caravan i was super surprised. Our Caravan felt modernish and wasnt ugly at all. No old applicances or furniture. It all looked up to date and good.

When we came in i had brought cleaning supplies after reading they may be necessary, but all linen on beds was clean and fresh, the toilets had a just been cleaned sealed with wrapper on it and overall it didnt feel dirty at all which was my biggest worry! If i was going to knit pik, the area round the toaster did have some small crumbs, but i could see hownit was missed on a busy textured counter. I was happpy i didnt upgrade at reception.The caravan came equipped with all pots and pans but the reason we came to haven was because it gave us tbe ability to cook. As a kosher keeping family we brought all our own pots with us, but there was space to store it all thankfully. We just about managed with the undercounter fridge, and ths freezer was just a tiny part of it but thankfully we only came for 4 nights so it wasn't a problem.

We ordered a 2 bed caravan but were given a 3 bed caravan. We were 2 adults and a 4 year old so we had 3 spare beds which csme in great use as the bedrooms are tiny! Had we not had the extra bedroom im not sure where we would have put our cases as it the extra room became our much needed dressing room. I did wonder however if they would have given us a 2 bedroom like we ordered would the bedrooms have been bigger but i will never know.

The reason i couldnt give it 100 % was because the shows in the evening didnt interest me at all, and although they did offer a good few options for my 4 year old, there wasnt enough. We were happy to do our own thing though.The beach is a 4 mins drive away/15 minute walk. Very quiet and nice but no life guard.

Overall we were happy, there isnt really anything to go back to Church Farm for but we would definitely be trying a different haven site again!

1854,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,413,Hello campers,"My first experience of Butlins, although I have been to Warners, Haven, Park resorts amongst others before.

On arrival at the Ocean hotel we were faced with a queue to collect our keys & it seemed to take a little while for them to open all three available counters but that aside we didn't have to wait too long, having said that people were queuing down the stairs as we made our way to our room, I think this could have been better organised.

The two lifts (sometimes three if the service lift was available) just weren't adequate for the volume of people wanting to use them. Luckily we were only on the first floor so could use the stairs. They just needed to be twice the size, once you got a push chair or wheel chair in one there was very little room left for anything else &, although the sign said they'd take twelve people the warning buzzer would go off with just half a dozen people in & then the lift would refuse to move.

The room was nicely appointed, the bed comfortable & the bathroom was nice & clean although the air con seemed a bit hit & miss. There was a control panel in the room but it seemed like the hotel actually had overall control. We felt the bathroom would have benefited from a few more shelves.

Our first meal was in the on site fish & chip restaurant, not very good, the service was painfully slow & the food was poor, after complaining we got our drinks free. The manager was overly familiar & his false bonhomie was cringeworthy in the extreme.

The dining experience in the hotel was sometimes a little fraught due to unsupervised children getting under your feet, not the hotels fault, but we felt the restaurant could have been better arranged to help this situation. All the food, however, was very good. There wasn't one dish I tried I didn't like.

The resort, overall, seemed to be run quite well being generally clean & tidy. The entertainment was ok but my partner, who'd been before, said there wasn't as much of it as there'd been on her previous visits, she also said the new pool wasn't as good as the old one but I'll have to take her word for that as I never used either.

The children in our party (there were 11 of us) seemed to have a thoroughly good time, indeed they didn't want to go home.

So all in all a good bank holiday weekend break but, it has to be said, the unusually good weather helped immensely.

The reception staff also barely acknowledge you and are often quite rude which is very off putting. I've been a regular visitor for nearly 9 years and in that time the same family cubicles/baby changing facilities are broken and it seems have never been repaired. Half the showers never work in the ladies and if they do the water is always freezing. The toilets are also so dirty that my son nearly had an accident on the way home from his lesson as that was preferable to him using the facilities available. Come on Arun. The fundamentals are there, the lessons are amazing. Money just desperately needs to be spent on cleanliness and basic repairs.",2,1.0,0.0,0,1

Large orders, no problem, diners going into restaurant. However, the single bar person gets overwhelmed with restaurant orders which obviously gets priority by the boss. Monica. Result: the queue builds. At a bar with no one behind it, as the singular barman is now a waiter for the restaurant. Next; similar problem with a twist. Wait 20 mins for service then the cash guy arrives just when it’s my turn. Single barman disappears for ten minutes. Not replaced. Then, I’m in luck. Ha! No one at bar. Single barman. Who is making ten coffees at a minute a time, with other drinks. He apologises. No problem with him or any other bar person. They work hard. Unlike the waitresses (never seen a male waiter) who swan round working efficiently but in their down time spend ages on the phone and congregate round their till discussing Strictly, no doubt.

1885,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,176,Toddlers week - really quite brilliant ,"Arrival was smooth, drove straight up in the car at 1pm. No queue. We were shown where to park. In silver accommodation so made our way to their desk, told access to our rooms was 4pm, then given wrist bands and keys (the electronic card types) then were free to use the facilities: soft play/indoor/outdoor fairground. I went off to the big Tesco’s (7 mins drive away and they do click and collect!) to get our weekly shop.

They have trolleys (like airport trolleys) to help unpack the cars.

Our accommodation was nice: clean, tidy, basic, but comfortable. We were very lucky with the weather, it was very warm but I’m guessing in the apartment would not be warm without the sun on it all day. In fact, ours felt a little damp in bed at night! They have little electric heaters in the room but I’m not sure how helpful they would be?

The kitchen is VERY basic. Kettle, microwave, oven. Take tea towels!!! Even if they give you one, it’s flimsy and won’t help with drying up a whole families washing up every day for 4 days! As we were in silver accommodation we had no towels so took our own (forgot a hand towel for the bathroom though 🙄) didn’t even think to take soap for the bathroom!

The wardrobes are TINY no way I could have hung much up even for the kids (even if I had remembered to bring hangers).

Dinner at the Diner - poor service and they weren’t even that busy! Expensive food and distinctly average. Very disappointing.

Our ‘keys’ regularly stopped working and we had to keep walking back to guest services - really annoying! Even had to have maintenance come out to check the door for us!

Swimming pool was epic. So much fun. Such a shame that it isn’t open for more hours really.

Fair ground rides are traditional and the kids (4 and 1) loved them. Basically no queues for anything so was perfect for them really.

Shows were great. Didn’t bother with fast track passes and still had decent seats for the shows. Queues for photos with characters were quite long (and ultimately the packages for the photos aren’t cheap), but u can take your own photos.

Beach is a very short walk away (just outside the back gate). It’s pebbles though.

Check out by 10am but you can stay and use the facilities again.

If anything says how good our week was, we booked to go back in August! Even though it was 3 times more expensive and its school holidays! We got a fairly decent discount for booking before we left!

The chips and onion rings were limp and cold. My husband had penne arrabiatta which came in such a small bowl like a kids portion.
To say the least the meals were horrible. I don't know if your chef has changed and your menu changed as well but after so many good meals there I doubt if we will go there again in a hurry to eat.

went to bar to get food I must say service was fast and good food still think the choice should be maybe a bit more wider
Bar/Resturant size was good and was arcade but that's were it stops
Main entertainment hall far to small for amount of people the site can hold we thought once bingo finished quite a few would leave
nope it was like the OK CORAL trying to gets seats lots of hassle which put a bit of a downer on it as my child like the kids shows
queue for bar was a joke think the staff were on holiday already

last night I went over an hour before to get a good seat to be meet by queue of children put there by the adults while the drunk at the bar come 5 mins to open time there all barged in which nearly ended in a fight no security to be seen

1894,Arundel Castle,Attractions,Arundel,Historical/Culture,206,A perfect day out,"The Norfolk line has been here from almost Saxon times, but this castle is mainly the product of 19th century Victorian tastes for the gothic nod to medieval ""authenticity."" It makes for a wonderful visit if you can understand that the whole place is a piece of power-theatre. The original ancient ""keep"" is worth it for views of the perfectly English countryside - and (on a good day) view of the sea. The family ""chapel"" is almost a Disney rendition of gothic. You'll see grand rooms and private bedrooms here. But I felt the most wonderful aspect was the brilliantly designed and planted garden spaces, at this time of the year (early May) beautifully in bloom. I'd say Hatfield itself, as a town, is almost devoid of touristic ""cute"" - unlike Stratford-Upon-Avon or Warwick, this isn't (yet) a place enslaved by its main attraction. There are very good reasons to like Arundel apart from its castle.

Takes under two hours by train from Victoria Station in London, then a 15-minute walk into town to the main entrance. Don't miss the rest of this lovely town, especially the Priory. (Also, don't trust the guy in the castle restaurant who says the hot meals only start at noon - I settled for a cold sandwich and before I could eat that bad sandwich, the meat pies, freshly baked, were out for try.)

1898,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,45,Fun Easter break and lovely hotel Wave,"We spent a Monday to Friday here in the first week of April. The weather was brutal but we really enjoyed the place. The resort itself was quiet, no queuing for anything really and we were totally impressed by the hotel which was much better than expected. The rooms were very well planned with attention to detail - they thought of everything really.

All the staff were nice, cheerful and helpful apart from the miserable unfriendly man running the virtual reality rides.

We were unfortunate to be there for some very cold weather and this is one of the only niggles really - the resort did not respond to the change in temperature and a lot of places were cold. In particular the lovely lounge bar in the Wave hotel where we would have spent a lot of time (and money) was absolutely freezing. We actually left the resort a few times because it was uncomfortable and otherwise would have stayed there to eat or drink.

We had the old pool for its final outing and it was fine. The kids loved it and while it might look a bit tired, everyone enjoyed it.

The food was as expected. The buffet dining was poor although we only had breakfast there. It was quite expensive but the selection was immense. However, everything was poor quality and cheap ingredients. I would recommend the omelettes which are cooked to order and the fresh fruit and pancakes. Nothing else.

The fish and chip restaurant was fantastic, only a bit more expensive that you might expect but if you do the takeaway and eat on the tables outside, it is cheaper (but not in the sleet and hail!). Papa Johns was Papa Johns - totally fine as you would expect. The very cosy and nice looking coffee shop is extremely uncomfortable with hard seating - not somewhere to spend an hour with a coffee and a book while the kids go off so I used the hotel lounge bar which I really liked. Apart from the cold.

The activities were good value we thought with a £12.00 multi-activity ticket; we bought a few of these and the kids did everything almost. There was really so much to do, no one was bored and any down time was a welcome break and not a 'run out of things to do'. We did visit the beach just to say we had, but it was so cold that it was a fleeting visit. In nicer weather I would have explored the town and coastal area further but honestly there is enough in-resort to keep everyone occupied.

Rooms were comfortable, warm, nice bedding and comfortable beds. The kids loved their little cabin room and the balcony was nice to have. That is definitely worth paying extra for BUT, you really do have to complain about people smoking out there. Even though it clearly says it is not allowed, people still do it so if you have your doors open assuming the sleet stopped for a bit (we did have one nice day!) then you can enjoy your smoke filled room.

All in all this was outstanding value for money for a 5 day break for 4 people.

What we didn't like:
I think you might get the idea that we found the hotel lounge cold! enough said.
the gorgeous looking breakfast hot berry crumble is awful, don't be tempted
Pitchers of cocktails.....seem like great value for money but they are VERY weak
wine selection is dire, bring your own.
BIG DISLIKE: The pool closes at 5pm. This I found to be a real thumbs down. The pool (and resort?) is open to the public on a day basis for a fee so the pool can be very busy. For residents the pool is included in the price and so should be open later for us - this is really unfair to paying guests as we are all then forced into activities which are charged as extra when the children could really enjoy the pool with fewer people, later into the evening. Same with the fair, closes at 5pm and does not open until 11am. Adults also are customers! we might like a bit of a quiet swim earlier in the morning or later in the evening. This would be so much nicer if we could use it in a more flexible time frame. I know you need time to clean it but other resorts manage it with no problems (Centre parcs open 10am to 9pm). This looks like profiteering to me as these are two 'free' activities

Finally a good to know: If you book a twin room be aware that the beds are not standard 3ft singles but 2.6ft - for a fully grown adult they are very narrow. I went with my adult daughter and two younger kids.

Overall, loved our stay and will go back.

The changing rooms were nice and large however, they were filthy with rubbish, hair and even what looked like blood wiped down the wall with a finger! There was also hair and floating skin in the puddles in the queues up the stairs to the family raft. In the baby pool there seemed to be something floating in the water that looked like phlegm/snot! There were even people swimming with their outdoor clothes on. Totally unhygienic.
The slides had massive queues (fair enough when its holiday season) but when the queue time is made even longer than it should because they do not have enough rafts to cater for demand. Staff said they started off with 7 rafts but are down to only 4 now. Sort this out managers instead of making people wait longer than the queue time says. 20 minute expected time took 35 minutes just for a slide ride over in less than 30 seconds!
Teenagers were pushing in the queues in front of smaller children, including running and barging past, when I raised this issue with a member of staff nothing was said or done about it.
Two of the slides were also under 18's only. I don't see the sense in that when there were some teenagers around 12 stone or more when there were much smaller/petite adults wanting to go on. It should be done on weight NOT AGE! Never seen a large slide closed to adults anywhere else.
In all, a total and utter let down, badly managed and not once did I see anyone cleaning the filth during open hours. Other leisure centres have staff walking around with watering cans to rinse away hair and grime.

I needn't have worried!

From the warm welcome to the moment we left, we had a great time.

I didn't think there could possibly be enough to keep our 'clever' minds and 'highly tuned (ahem!)' bodies engaged for the full time. How wrong I was! Aside from the countless visible locks, as you delved and dug deeper, there were plenty of puzzles to solve, clues to find and things to work out to keep us all fully engaged and entertained for (almost) the full hour.

1914,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,16,In need of a make over ,"Having spent a lot of my childhood at the site I was excited to come back as an adult with our family. We booked a kids weekend with my sister, brother in law and child (just under 2), my parents and my parter (I am pregnant).

The accommodation was basic but clean. Couldn’t complain about location or facilities in the room apart from the uncomfortable beds. All members of the party woke up with back ache every morning. Housekeeping were really good, and made shapes out of the towels every day which was fun!

The food in the deck was good with a lot of variety. Only comment would be that the one night I had pasta from the pasta station the guy was too busy talking he forgot to actually cook the pasta and only realised once the sauce was ready so I had to wait double the time for the meal.

The resort itself is perfect for kids, however it is looking tired and in desperate need of refurb. Feels like there’s too much accommodation and not enough activity for the masses. All good and well spending money on new additions (the pool) but what about maintaining the facilities you already have?

Also barely saw any red coats during the trip. Isn’t that what Butlin’s is known for?!

Haven’t decided if I would go back.

Now Butlins is popular again they've given up trying to improve, and it shows. Fewer staff, grubby, no where to park, people smoking in non-smoking areas, queue jumping constantly, throwing dirty nappies on the floor. Butlins seems to bring out the worst in people, generally just couldn't care less about anyone else.

New pool is far too busy with 50min queues for the flumes, and again people just pushing in. Staff could not care less. Wife was told to f-off when she called out a man and his family for doing it. This one incident tells you all you need to know about this place. If you're a half-way decent family, save your money for Center Parcs or go abroad. You won't enjoy it here.

Kids enjoyed it on the whole, but even they got upset at other people's behaviour. New panto is nowhere near last year's standard and Mr Men show was the same as last year. Didn't see any characters walking around. Seems like they've given up.

Wave hotel is looking grubby, in need of some major TLC. Deck restaurant is too busy, food mediocre, floors sticky and men's toilet floor soaked with urine and who knows what else. Has gone down hill massively since we first started coming - no way we'll be back.

Cleanliness:
Firstly, the hotel was very clean. This is the first thing I pick up on wherever I stay. It was honestly immaculate.

Comfort:
The room was very spacious and the bed and pillows were comfy. Plenty of storage/wardrobe space and ample additional seating in the room.

Value:
Exceptional value for what it is. We had looked to stay at The Goodwood hotel, however this was very expensive. Once we had paid for The Comfort Inn and our taxi there and back, we still had £120 change from what it would have cost us to stay at Goodwood Hotel.

Food:
We stayed for breakfast and it was really nice. We were able to help ourself to breakfast and there was plenty on offer. The food was hot and the service was great.

Hospitality:
The staff were very helpful and after a recent bad experience elsewhere, its refreshing to actually see staff happy. Working like they actually enjoy working there. Nothing was too much trouble and they even offered to order us taxis after we mentioned our plans when we arrived.",5,4.0,2.0,0,0

This place is noisy beyond tolerance. Bare white plastered walls, no tableclohs and music blaring in the restaurant from the bar. It is noisy with absolutely no ambience. It is impossible to have a conversation without shouting accross the tightly packed tables. I have had quieter meals in burger chains on kids birthdays.
Yes on arrival we were greeted at the door and ushered to our table whereupon we were asked if we wanted to order wine before we had sat down. very pushy.
Instantly had the feeling of being ""processed"" not welcomed.
A waitress brought menu's and again asked if we wanted to order wine before we had seen the drinks menu. We declined saying we would choose drinks to go with our meal.
She returned and asked again!
Eventually we ordered. First we got Bruscetta as one dish which was a whole pannini with vey little strips of pepper and beetroot with 1 tiny anchovy, I had 3 of the smallest sardines you have ever seen.
On complaint we were told that this was the chef's interpretaion of what a Bruscetta might be......not an actual bruscetta (and nothing like that shown on their web site)
For mains we had a sea trout fillet (average but not special) and I ordered the Chicken breast with pancetta and crushed new potatoes and""greens"". What I got was a minute chicken breast About 1/3 supermarket size with two very small new potatoes and some long strands of green vegitables that I can only deduce to be cabbage. I could not tell. There was no pancetta but there was a hard brown golf ball size lump of something that i assumed was the stuffing. it was inedble.
A waitress asked if the meal was ok but did not pause for a reply so I called her back. I complained about my meal and our accompanying garlic ciabatta that was again just pannini . She was happy to stand and argue with me her main defences being that 1. they had never had complaints before and 2. the ciabatta is what their supplier sends them ( does their chef not order his supplies? or is it a case of anything will do for the punters?)
They took my meal away and replaced it with what was described as ""veal Milanese. I could go on for hours but by now I had lost faith that they new anything about what they were serving up. There were breadcrumbs (not parmesan) over cooked and burnt around the edes covering some tough, tasteless, dark brown meat. I have never seen veal that colour before.
We ordered coffee and left.

However, what really spoiled our evening was the service. We were the first couple to occupy one of a group of four tables, which later filled up, but by the end of the evening we were still waiting for our desserts after all the other three sets of guests had finished their meals and left. We asked several times if we could have the course we were waiting for and got a surly ""it's on its way"" followed by further waiting. Before our desserts arrived, the server cleared our table of everything; our napkins, our cutlery, and the rose in its vase. My wife asked if she could have the rose and it was dumped on the table in front of her. When our desserts finally came and we'd eaten them, we felt the attitude towards us was ""hurry up and leave"", when the delay was all of their making, so we didn't bother with coffee, paid up and left.

1958,Church Farm,Accommodation,Littlehampton,AccomOther,6,Disappointed - massive change in a year,"Just come back from a week at a privately rented caravan. The caravan, the grounds and the majority of the staff are great and have kept a similar standard every year we have been there. However the clubhouse, restaurant have really gone down hill. The games room had no air con all week, the machines kept braking. The guys working in games area were really helpful but having used some of the machines for the last few years the difference was really quite noticeable. The restaurant, what’s happened. Price has gone up and the quality gone down. Food looks like it just thrown on the plate. Kids food supposed to come with veg, the only one that did came with raw, dried up carrot swirls that were all dried out!! Having eaten in the restaurant most nights for the last 3 years, we only went twice and said we wouldn’t go again. Salmon salad was like old bits of lettuce that should have been thrown out. Stir fry was over cooked, sloppy and tasted horrid. Chicken burger came with a small handful of thrown on chips, rest of the plate was empty. I understand it isn’t a 5* restaurant but having had some nice food and service from that restaurant before it was more noticeable. Every drink we ordered came in dirty glasses, we were told it was just water marks but they were grim with lipstick marks, old bits of dried lemon!! Tried to get a slush on three occasions, each time the machine wasn’t working. It’s a shame as the clubhouse as always been good value for money but this time it was awful.

The kids had so much fun on the large swing and making new friends. The Fox pub is a short walk away and good for lunches, I'd recommend you make a booking especially for Sunday lunch.

The only thing we didn't like was when we were playing our music quite low and just within our camp pitch area, we were then told that there was a no music policy because guest should enjoy the sounds of the forest, which is fair enough and we had enjoyed the sounds of the forest for 24hrs and on this afternoon wanted to listed to a bit of music which I think should have been our choice.",4,2.0,2.0,0,0

The restaurant is dirty. The salad cart was almost empty and completely tasteless! No rotisserie chicken on the menu as run out. My second choice of pork belly had also run out, the waitress Rosin couldn’t care at all, shrugged her shoulders and walked off. Never came back. We asked for the manager who was very friendly and said all the right things, we placed an order of drinks and never saw her again. Had to go to the bar to collect our drinks as 20 minutes had passed. The barman was too busy on his phone to sort the drinks order, didn’t even acknowledge us. The food was not that great and we had to send 1 plate back.
Basically this place is run by kids who have no customer skills whatsoever.

1964,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,118,Hotel tarnishes the Hilton brand,"We stayed here for one night. The Hilton group offers a middle of the road standard. Being an old manor, we thought Avisford Park might in fact offer a little more appeal than usual. Unfortunately we were disappointed. This hotel looks so tired and is in desperate need of an upgrade and modernisation. Carpets are worn, walls are scuffed, the beds are very hard and it really is not a four star hotel.
Our room was large and airy but it was old fashioned - in a bad way - no character here. The bathroom was very dated.
Although the food served at breakfast was satisfactory, service at breakfast was poor and the young staff need some training. It was all very basic.
How can this be a Hilton? We will bypass it next time if we are ever in the area again. There are plenty of other nice hotels in the area to choose from.

We asked to check out at 2230 and had to argue for a refund. No goodwill gestures made. In our opinion the hotel is greedy cramming weddings in and not notifying other guests of this!

1977,The Dragon,Food,Littlehampton, Fast Food/Takeaway,30,"Noisy, grumpy staff, flavourless food","6 of us dined on Saturday evening. Parking a problem - both car parks in front and behind the restaurant were full at 6.50 p.m. so, had no choice but to park on the road - imagine the neighbours are probably fed up with this. Evening started off well enough although, as some other reviewers have noted - what, exactly has been refurbished! My sister commented that the carpet looks the same as when it was the Smugglers Roost (30+ years ago!). Lots of people in the bar area with the football on, restaurant busy and we were early - 7 p.m. The restaurant is large and we were seated in the area where the restaurant bar is and where takeaways are collected from. From the very beginning, the noise levels are significant, making it almost impossible to have a normal conversation, the phone constantly ringing for takeaway orders and people in and out to collect. We opted for the 'All you can eat' buffet which is good value for money as, other than the 2 Lobster dishes, you can chose anything you want. However, whilst the food is plentiful, I can't say it had much flavour to it. The evening started to deteriorate when the staff started to bring out wrong dish after wrong dish to us and, when we politely pointed this out, the correct dishes took ages to arrive so we were all eating at different stages. The staff became grumpier as the evening went on with one young girl looking like she had been in floods of tears, one couldn't help herself but slam everything onto the table and a smile was certainly beyond her, another was the only one who seemed to know what was going on and was apologetic over the service. My sister used the ladies toilet at the end of the evening and said she felt as though her shoes were sticking to the flooring - yuk! And to cap it all, they put a service charge on the bill too - needless to say, we didn't pay that and we won't be going back.

1985,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,1,Not impressed!!!,"After hearing fabulous reviews of the Bognor Regis revamp we decided that we would take the plunge and go for it! My husband and myself work very hard for very low wages, we only get to holiday every few years so it's important for us as a family to choose the right holiday do that we can make the most of every moment! We arrived on site and had to wait for our silver room to be vacated by a staff member before we could get in, on entering there was good on the carpets in both bedrooms and an overwhelmingly bad smell of deep heat, we didn't want to start being negative and so we opened the windows and set off to explore! On returning the smell was just awful, but by then the oyster bay reception was shut; we phoned the emergency contact number for assistance - nothing was done, we then hunted down a member of staff on foot a few hours later- nothing done, we tried to make the best of it but my husband and myself couldn't sleep, I was physically sick as the smell was so bad and my husband was very angry - on holiday and we couldn't sleep because of the stink of deep heat! We soon realised the smell was coming from the mattress and pillows, they were absolutely covered, we were covered- my husband and myself absolutely stank too! For our third attempt the next day we went to the main reception in Butlins and asked for some help- thank God we were finally listened to and the kind lady contacted some one to change our mattress asap! Our room also had exposed wiring in our uplighters next to our bed, they were very low down - we had to keep warning our daughter to stay away from them as we were worried she would get an electric shock! We had pre-booked action passes - though the website fails to mention you need certain shoes for the go karts- which left me unable to ride, very upsetting! It also fails to mention that the bungee ropes also require you to wear short or trousers no skirts or dresses allowed- my little girl was devastated! Why not mention specifics on website so that you know what is required for specific activities?! Very disappointing and distressing! We loved the fair rides and spent alot of our time there, the arcades were also good. I was disappointed in the night entertainment- 'late night quiz? And disco?' Was this a joke? As a family we were excited to take part- expecting pens, paper and bundles of fun.... A couple of questions flashing up on a tiny t.v. with the answer following shortly is not a quiz nite....it's a let down, an awful excuse for entertainment! And the disco...? A couple or redcoats flailing about, crammed in between the stage and the chairs is not a disco-its depressing! We loved the sleeping beauty pantomime- amazing job, really fabulous and funtastic! And we loved the circus - really brilliant, made the whole experience bearable! We made some friends with some lovely members of centre stage staff Charley, Jaime-Lee and manager Steven- can't sing your praises enough, shining examples of wonderful people doing an amazing job!!! My daughter was refused to be able to join the line to get her magic kit signed by Steven Mulhern as she was a few seconds late - they gave 10 seconds for people to join line- we couldn't make it in time, no matter how many times my husband asked he was not allowed to join line with my daughter, he promised to sign each and every set purchased, my daughter was distraught and beside herself...long after Mulhern had left, way after the disco and quiz had finished along came Charley and her angels; Charley was so concerned about my daughter being upset and let down, she took time with Jaime-Lee to make her feel special- a million thank you's to you lovely lady's, you really bake a difference! Then Charley and Jaime-Lee got together with Manager Steven, who tracked down Mulhern and requested magic set to be signed as promised! My daughter was so happy - thankyou to you wonderful and caring staff- never stop being amazing, you make a difference in the world!!! Overall we were very disappointed with the whole fiasco, we worked hard to afford this holiday, and we couldn't even sleep whilst there! Would we come back? Unlikely!

1986,Black Rabbit,Food,Arundel, Pub/Bar,342,Mostly indifferent (or poor) food...no comprehension of customer service!!!,"
We, a group of five friends, meet every four/six weeks for a meal, sometimes trying somewhere different for a change. I’m not sure who suggested the Black Rabbit.......

None of the food was particularly good and some was dreadful. The whitebait was flabby, steak pie was good (although with a mass produced look), a burger was tough and looked/felt like it had been made ages before and reheated. A steak was tough. None of us risked a pudding.

Whatever we thought of the food we all agreed the service was terrible. Our main course was served about thirty five/ forty minutes after finishing the starters, an hour and ten minutes after we all sat down.

My wife specifically asked if she could have a “small 125 measure of Sauvignon wine”. She was told she could have the smaller measure, although a 175ml measure was supplied and when queried the waiter said “not to worry as only 125ml would be charged for”. Needless to say 175ml appeared on the bill! (My wife left a considerable amount of wine in the glass - the issue was not the money, it was she just doesn’t want that much wine, and for some drivers the larger measure could put them above the ‘drink/drive’ limit). Despite the law saying 125ml has to be supplied if requested it is often difficult to obtain. (On this occasion given the lengths gone to specify 125ml I spoke to the local Licensing Authority. They confirmed the smaller measure was legally required to be displayed and supplied if requested. They will add The Black Rabbit to their inspection list. I can only hope they take enforcement action sometime).

As for getting the bill and then trying to pay it......when we eventually got it, we asked for the bill to be split between two couples and one single and to include circa 10% service (why we included service I don’t know!). Oh no!, “the system” couldn’t cope with this meaning the manager had to be found (more delay!). After being told how difficult it was to alter the bill I said I intended to leave my name and address and the bill could be posted on, it was agreed a new bill would be prepared!!!

My advice to anyone thinking of visiting - go elsewhere, there are far better run pubs not far away.

However a friend and I thought we would try lunch to see if there had been an improvement since our last visit. My friend had chicken curry and I had the salt and pepper squid. The squid came as lumps of tough over cooked batter with a tiny bit of squid inside and looked more like scampi. It was accompanied by a rather tasteless salad which I left. My friend who normally loves curries left most of hers as she said it was so poor. I rather suspect the salt and pepper squid was frozen. Nothing wrong with that but ideally it should be freshly made as it’s so simple and quick to make.

Having said that, the bar staff were very friendly and the drinks acceptable. The criticism we both had was the price of the food. At over £12 each this is far too much for what is not even gastro pub quality.

Check in was pretty fast apart from a slight glitch in the system but they explained what had happened and we waited in the waiting area and a lady came over to us to go through check in with us, and what was available on site and showed us points on the map etc, was very helpful.
We had the standard caravan and i have to say it was really nice, was a lot better than i was expecting for a cheap price. Was spotlessly clean and fresh and had everything we needed in there (cups, plates, cooking pots etc). I know you have to bring your own tea towels and washing liquid etc so we had that with us.
We also had a really nice spot which didn't have much foot traffic passing through and we were 2 mins from the nature trail walk which we did and it was really nice with lots of greenery and some horses to view on your walk. It leads to the Harbour and the Lagoon too, the latter which we also went to visit and fed the ducks and swans there from the bridge.
The club house we only used briefly as our son is a bit young still to join in but we saw a kids show for a bit which was ok and the toddlers were up dancing and having a good time it seems.
We didn't really eat much on site as we did our own cooking but we did get a portion of chips from the chippy by the arcade and they were delicious.
We didn't use all the facilities as again our child is a bit young but there did seem plenty to keep kids occupied and would definitely return again when he is a bit older.

2016,Swan Hotel,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,63,"Unfortunately, not a ‘LUXURY’ Stay!!!","We stayed here on Halloween as it was our 1 year Wedding Anniversary. I had requested through booking.com for the hotel to do ‘anything they could to make our stay extra special’ with it being our anniversary. This was confirmed back that the hotel would do this. I had no idea or thought as to what that would actually be, but anything to add a special touch would have been lovely. This did not happen which was really disappointing as it was confirmed they would do something. We Got into our room and I have to say, for £124 and the ‘LUXURY’ room, I was very underwhelmed! We needed an iron so rang down for one, the lad said he’d be straight up. Approx an hour later, I rang again and he’d forgotten as it was very busy at the bar and he was on his own. 5 minutes later, he brought the iron. Whilst waiting for the iron, I had a shower in what should have been a flawless bathroom but there was mould around door edges, the shower and the middle of the ceiling. Again, not what you’d expect for a ‘luxury’ room. We went out for tea through the night exit / entrance and found it left on the latch which is a security concern, I took it off to make sure it was closed properly. Got back to the room and I tried to watch the Telly but it was wonky, I tried to straighten it but realised the bracket itself was wonky so I left it!! The lighting in the room at night is quite dark and my wife found it very hard to do her makeup, resorting to using her phone torch!!
The next morning I put the cases on the car and again, the night entrance was on the latch so anyone could walk in off the street! I went to breakfast and picked up my side plate to get a croissant, I thought the plate was stained as I could see a yellow tint on it and then realised it was actually a Dirty plate!!!!! The breakfast was very good and they catered for my specific requests, it was just very disappointing that we kept finding issues. I wanted to make sure I told the hotel about our experience and did at the bar. The person I spoke to did not fill me the confidence that she would pass on my concerns so I emailed the Hotel. I have accepted a refund for my stay, which is fine......I just wish they’d got it right on the night though!!! I have given the hotel a 2 star as we did not experience ‘LUXURY’ and I was told I would be contacted Monday morning for the refund and I actually had to ring up around 6pm to sort it!!!
If in Arundel again, I’ll try somewhere else instead.

The adults or children, certainly weren't frightened of humans or aggressive towards us. The visitor centre, cafeteria and gift shop were all very clean, tidy, airy and inviting.

2019,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,7,Hoped for three night stay,"Booked this hotel for a quiet three day break, did not stay.

For a start if you look at the photographs of the double rooms you will see that the same photograph is used for different types of double rooms but the daily price is different. We could find nowhere on the site that informed guests that there was no lift. When we booked in we asked for a room with a stand in shower (we should have asked for a walking one) as my partner has arthritis and has difficulty in bending we were shown a room on the fourth floor, up four flights of stairs. The room had a shower over the bath which was unsuitable for us. We asked for a room on a lower floor with a walking shower but all showers are over the bath. The rooms are rather dated and not suitable at all for people with any form of disability. We decided not to stay, which was a pity, the Hotel should make very clear that there is no lift and are not really suited to people who are even slightly disabled.

We did not eat in the restaurant on this occasion but it was always busy and the menu and specials looked wonderful. The Sunday lunch carvery look particularly delicious.

For one of our drinks I ordered a G&T, as they have a good choice of gin, and was watching the gin being poured into the measure and was very surprised to see that it was a short measure and when the team member was challenged they denied it. Measures should be filled to the top, not half a centimetre below because they’re afraid to spill the spirit.
On ordering our food I asked for gluten free mozzarella sticks to be told that there were none. This isn’t the first time there has been menu items or drinks unavailable because of poor stock control.
When our meal was delivered one item had to be returned as it was cold and a gluten free burger had a gluten containing side on the same plate which had the risk of cross contamination.
For desert a gluten free was ordered and when it was subsequently brought to the table it had a wafer in it, so was sent back.
Whilst our food related problems were resolved there appears to be a wholesale lack of knowledge about allergens and this should be addressed as a matter of urgency.
Extremely poor customer service - The staff were not engaging with the vast majority of customers and seemed to have favourite customers and had no awareness of what was happening as there were tables left uncleared for 20 - 30 mins. Started to feel that we were an inconvenience to them.

Our room was supposed to be “deluxe ” (please check the photos) it was facing the parking,the carpet had stains,the shower was about to fall…poor quality in all materials,we had the feeling that the hotel was built in the 90s and has no had any renovation.
When we arrived we were told that they had 2 weddings that night,that was not a problem at all.The issue was that around 1am the fire alarm started to beep.Being 8.5 months pregnant didn't help to get out of the room quick, went downstairs following the signals and we ended up behind the hotel in a dark and isolated point,nobody from the hotel was there to help
After 2 minutes someone said it was safe to go back -not an official communication from the hotel.
The following morning we discovered that our room was above the staff entrance to the spa or some other facilities so around 6am a door was banging constantly.Remember:8.5 months pregnant woman had 4h sleep.We complained at reception,but not any compensation (other than free hot chocolate –honestly?) was offered

The service,their response,noise, the terrible status of the room…those are not things you expect when you go to a Hilton and especially if you’re a Honors member

As for food on the complex.....chips dry as old bones from the ‘traditional chip shop’ , pub stops food at 9pm, not everyone likes eating pizza and burgers, the diner not open at 8pm....did it even open?? Where are people meant to eat after 9pm? Burger King or papa johns just are not acceptable choices?!?!? Considering this is a holiday why does butlins shut/stop so early?? It’s ridiculous...adults are kept in line with the children and so called adult entertainment is abysmal....for example skyline ended tonight at 8.15 pm, the cafe there wasn’t open at 7.15pm when we walked round.....not even a chance of a coffee and centre stage ended at 10.15pm, as I’m not a drinker I have no desire to sit in bar Rosso...so off we go home to bed as nothing else to do.....a nice early night to get up early and look forward to a load of nothing again.....I remember when butlins was really good, kids had a great time, you could get a coffee with ease in the evening, you can’t even walk round in the skyline and have a look in the gift shops or sweet shop as they all close at silly o’clock....the cinema is no more it’s now a left luggage place.....seems to me butlins can palm the kids off with rubbish entertainment as kids accept any old crap.....adults don’t, so we won’t be back.....the most happiest member of staff I met was the litter picker man on the Monday nice friendly happy old chap....now....what is this smoking area ‘thing’, designated areas, it’s like we are being treated like 2nd class citizens the way these smoking places are positioned.....yes smoking is anti social but you have taken it to the extreme, as for one of your funfair workers lecturing me about if I smoke by the rides he will be telling me off and him finding it funny how the smokers are hidden in the ridiculous smoking area by the ice cream shop.....really?!?!?! I do not expect to be spoken to by one of your staff like that.....my holiday wasn’t free gratis and I don’t expect hostility because I smoke.....you need to up your game all round in my opinion

2061,Norfolk Arms,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,21,Possibly my worst roast dinner..?,"It was Easter Sunday around 3pm and we were hungry. We saw the Norfolk Arms was advertising roast dinners and, although it was fairly expensive, decided to give it a try. I went to the Norfolk Tap bar to order two roast beef dinners and one pork, and bought some drinks, including a lovely Tarrant Street IPA. When our food arrived, the pork roast had some apple sauce included, but we had to ask for horseradish sauce to go with the beef. It arrived quickly, but without a serving spoon.
Although mum-in-law's pork was OK, our beef was dry and overcooked. The roast potatoes were hard, dry and leathery and the Yorkshire pudding hard and dry as a bone. The parsnips were almost raw and inedible. This was food that had been standing a LONG time. I don’t tolerate bad food and, had we had a check-back, I would have voiced our dissatisfaction. However, none was forthcoming and, as the kitchen was a long way away and it was now after 3 o'clock, we thought we'd have to get on with it or go hungry.
This was one of the most expensive roast dinners I have had, but it was also one of the worst, only one I foolishly ordered from a Wetherspoons being worse.
If you can't keep food warm satisfactorily, then don’t sell it. My wife is a chef and knows how to keep food warm without spoiling and NOT to serve food that is no longer fit for eating. We’re local and will never come back, but it would be nice if other customers didn't have to endure such poor standards.

The rooms are very well appointed bearing in mind the age of the property, which was part of its charm. There are just a few issues that could be easily fixed such as the curtain off its hook. Some people may find the stairs a problem but they do have rooms in the Courtyard. Once you do reach the top rooms I gather the view of the Castle is breath taking.

2095,White Swan Arundel,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,273,Great foodie place,"I picked this hotel for its proximity to Arundel town centre. We had planned a visit to the castle and its gardens and the cathedral.
Although only 1.5 miles to the town, its not a easy walk as the path runs out, so youll still need to drive or book the short taxi ride.
I booked thru booking.com for the first couple of days in May 2019.
The hotel was very quiet, not that many covers in the 2 evenings we ate there.
The food was 10/10. My wife rarely is offered interesting vegetarian options, but here the selection was amazing. The quality of the food matched the description as well. My food choices were also immense and overall we were extremely satisfied. Im a real ale fan and always choose the local beers in offer.
The 2 local Ales offered were very plain and not something you wanted a refill of.
We visited the Arundel Brewery and they had some very tasty beers I could recommend to the manager. The room was adequate. It was in need of TLC, but it was clean and the bed pretty comfy.
The view from the room had good and bad aspects, we could see the open fields instead of the road, but the kitchen flues were a couple of feet from our window si we kept it shut, just in case. Service was tip, top, though we didnt see the same people serve us twice, i guess due to shift patterns.
I would certainly go back, but perhaps choose a different room to 28.

did come with a double bed and two bunk beds.
which would have accommodated 4 people instead we had to get adjoining rooms which was fine accept we had to pay a bit more for this.

This did not inconvenience us too much though I Have to wonder how they accommodate lager parties and also question why we could not just have stayed in one room??? there is no clear explanation for this other than to charge more money.

overall we had a good time I would highly recommend the adult weekends if you have never been before GO! its so much fun

2106,"Crossbush, Beefeater",Food,Arundel, Steakhouse/Diner,2,Terrible,We've been to Beefeaters before and always been fairly happy on previous occasions. However going there today I can only say that it was the worst Sunday roast I have ever had. Roast potatoes were so overdone it was ridiculous. My wife had a vegetarian roast and when asked for more gravy was brought out beef gravy. She's not vegetarian but what if she had been. The waitresses were nice but the service was incredibly slow and drink orders kept getting forgotten. This was probably because it was understaffed. I won't be going there again and feel like I've just thrown away £50 on a pretty awful meal. It didn't help that we had a couple sitting behind us who had also a bad experience but didn't excuse the fact that the man was swearing constantly to his wife when thd staff weren't around.

I wasn’t sure how to spell her name but I managed to ask for the receipt today and got it. “ELISHA” always served with a smile, made sure my children had there cakes (Oreo ones) and milkshakes and by the second day knew my order, I was visiting in the morning and at night time and she was always smiling and made time to speak. Also made me and my partner the best caramel latte coolers! Yum! Please send this message to her from the pickard family... Also a big thank you to the wave hotel.

I had a glass of water with the food which tasted like there had previously been bleach or a chemical in the glass. After tipping out on the grass there was some odd residue in the bottom. It smelt strongly of chemicals. I hope it wasn’t anything dangerous.
The wine was nice though!
Most alarming to me was the fact I tried to use a high chair here for my 13 month old baby which was filthy and the strap had sharp staples through it and had sellotape which was obviously meant to cover the staples that had slipped. A second was exactly the same! Disgraceful",1,2.0,0.0,0,1

All the food was very well cooked with great flavours and a good price.
The only downside we had was the table where we were sat, right beside the bar. The problem being the shape of the bar encroached on your table space making you feel cramped.

2115,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,13,Good day but not as described,"Visited for the day with our little girl (9 months) and although we ended up having a nice day that was more because we made the most of it, rather than because of the site and facilities. Feel like the website is incredibly misleading, and wouldn't recommend it for those with very young children.
Firstly with the mini fairground, swimming and entertainment we felt like we were given an impression that there would be plenty for us to do with our daughter. However everything had height restrictions on and we were not able to accompany her on the rides either. That meant the only thing she could really go on were the paid for rides in the arcade. Not sure what the point is of a mini fairground if those who can't ride the main fairground rides are excluded!
We'd planned on the swimming being a big part of our day, and having read the website we had high expectations. The changing village 'designed with mumsnet' featured several rave reviews so we were looking forward to using them. However to be blunt they are like any other changing rooms I've ever visited, just with a seat belted chair for children in each changing cubicle. The underfloor heating promises 'no more soggy socks' but must have been off on the day we visited as there was a good few centimetres of standing water everywhere - including the toilets! It was a horrible experience really, we wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.
We also had a terrible experience in the pub-style restaurant on site, with slow service, poor prices and terrible value, limited availability from the menu, staff who didn't listen to requests and low quality food.
Both the meals my wife and I wanted were unavailable, and there was no coke zero. We also asked for no ice in the cokes and they were packed full. Our wait for food was long despite the pub being quiet and when it arrived the portion sizes were terrible for £6/7, note the 'side salad', and my chicken & bacon bbq wrap tasted awful.
The bar/bowling area was great and we enjoyed that, although it was bizarre we found the best changing facilities here.
Overall perhaps we were naive to take our little one at such a young age, but we booked based on the info online and feel mislead. Wouldn't recommend for very young families.

Wasn’t very clean. Cupboard to boiler is broken can see the broken walls and cobwebs etc in the cupboard. Asked for some pillows for the beds as I have a disability two days ago still no extra pillows. It looks like butlins but there is something missing from what it used to have.

Well better cut of meat so that is what we ordered.
This was the toughest piece of meat we have had and a total waste of money.
ALL there meals come with chips, (ALL OF 5 when available) and they call it this FINE DINING!!
We decline having deserts or coffee but the waiter insisted we spoke to the manager.
The manager was called and I asked about the wording of 'FINE DINING' he said they was going to remove that and offer a new menu which would be in 2 weeks and took our number and said he would phone us when this NEW menu was available for us to sample free of charge as a gesture of good will as our evening had been spoilt.

2133,Fino,Food,Bognor, Restaurant,3,An anniversary ruined,"Now to be fair the waitress acted responsibly throughout.
The Aperol Spritz despite instructions on the back of every bottle was terrible the recommended 3 parts prosecco, 2 parts aperol and 1 part soda included at least 10 parts soda if any prosecco at all.
The rump steak was not rare as requested but well done and chewy but the worst was the under-cooked fish on the point of raw, concealed within a wrap of pancetta. This any chef will know is very dangerous and can lead to anisakiasis a parasitic disease caused by anisakid nematodes(worms) invading the stomach wall of humans. Offering to cook it again or replace it with something else just doesn't cut it when you are already beginning to doubt the ability of the establishment.
The waitress offered to replace the Aperol Spritz and took it off the bill. The fish course was also deducted but they left the uneaten fries on £3.

So half eaten steak and half bottle of wine consumed whilst waiting ad nauseum for food is a lousy way of spending an anniversary or any other celebration so I would recommend finding somewhere else that genuinely cares about quality.

Sadly a few factors prevent this potentially wonderful hotel from being a great stay. The common areas were horribly neglected: dirty carpets, cobwebs all the way up the stairs, the bin-housing left open almost constantly with all its grime, grease and smells. Employees were seated on the ground, smoking in the car park and dirty laundry was left in a pile by the exit for quite some time.

The back of my bathroom door was heavily spattered with someone else's toothpaste or soap remains, which was an unpleasant surprise although the high quality bath gel and shampoo were welcome. The bathmat had a large hole in it although all linen was clean.

This wonderful, old building could, with a little TLC, a good, deep clean and some attention to interior design, be a really nice boutique-type hotel. Instead it's tired, shoddy and seems unloved. A real pity. Such potential!

On arrival in our room we noticed hair in the toilet, hair in the bath, carpet looked like it hadn’t been touched with a Hoover, thick dust on the phone and tv (clearly not been cleaned for ages) you could leave finger prints in the dust!! filth all over the coffee tray and filth in the fridge, dust and grime around the edges of the floor and sliding door, some disgusting bit of muck on the sink! we have never complained before to a hotel but the standard was poor and made us feel dirty just looking at it! The manager was very good and moved us to the service recovery room. This at first glance appeared a lot better. Then in the children’s room there was thick dust on the windowsill, the remote for the children’s tv had the batteries held in by 2 plasters which is ridiculous!! ..a hair clip, 1p piece and small bouncy ball had all be overlooked when cleaned and my one year old grabbed 2 of these items off the floor!
The lifts are crazy, you stand there for ages and when one does arrive you can’t fit in. When I put in a letter of complaint I was told the lifts are fit for the amount of guests but I wonder if they have actually considered how many of their guests have young children in buggy’s! In my opinion and many of the people we talked to in the que It would seem not! When I wrote a letter of complaint they took little responsibility for the state of the rooms and stated that they had a ‘resolve on site policy’, having already wasted time moving from the filthy room to the ‘service recovery room’ which was still dirty I would wonder why they would think I would bother complaining more on site. Surely the service recovery room is as good as it gets!

I felt like I was just returning to my old family home in a way: because the same waiting staff who were there a year ago are still there and so they must be happy in their work I assume: I love the eccentricities of this place: the formal dining, the really TALL waiter and the really SHORT waiter, the cut -glass-practically-royal-family accents of the receptionists, the KINDNESS of the beauty therapists. NOTHING all over the world can compare to the joy of waking on a deserted beach and then crossing the lawn and entering a warm honey stone ancient looking building surrouned by lavender bushes.......and drinking local cider by an apple log fire or indeed climbing into a four poster bed with the window open and listening to the sea while eating a freashly baked moist chocolate biscuit and drinking tea out of a perfectly elegant china tea cup. and the next morning: swiming in that warm outdoor swiming pool: nothing but mist and steam and lying on my back in the pool staring at the dark winter branches of the trees and hearing the call of a pheasant. and yet it was only 2 hours drive from central london! i enjoyed my break so much i send my young daughter and her boyfriend: they loved the whole mini break experience too: it made a great christmas present for 20 somethings!!!!

I rejoined the queue, leaving food to get cold. After another 5 minutes gave up and went to ask the manager who gave the same answer.

The food eventually came after waiting 2 hours. This is an extremely long time considering we live within one mile of the takeaway. When it came I had wished it didn’t – it was completely cold and soggy. The crispy Chinese food we enjoy was cold and mushy. The food comes in tinfoil lined bags so it had sweated and gone cold. We microwaved the noodles but as the rest of the food looked a mess so we had to throw it in the bin.
I called the takeaway the following day, not really to complain but to let them know of the poor service I received. The guy told me he will tell the manager and he would get back to me whilst I would likely get 15% off my next order. I never heard back or got an apology from them, hence me writing this review. I wouldn’t go back even with 15% off. I paid £20 for a load of rubbish and the customer service was that of business that simply doesn’t care.

He jumped to offer me the highchair and was going to bring it out to me but ended up just having me sit inside at the table and made me feel so welcome it was far above and beyond his job since I didn’t even buy anything from him he came and bought my son some colouring things checked if we are okay brought him sweets And was just so kind to us. I was touched by how caring and wonderful he was seeing as we didn’t make a penny for him.

The food was not to bad but there was the occasional imbosile around causing hassle to Rob however it was not to bad apart from the diner - took to long and did not allow us to enter with some hungry kids which we wanted to feed! The Rides were appalling to say the least, we tried to get onto the bumper cars together but they said ""not even one of you could fit in one"", very offensive and in general very disheartening. There was a statue of Billy Butlin and all the youngsters of the modern age were chanting ""willy butlin"" - how immature.

2175,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,69,Horrendous noise Oyster Bay,"In Oyster Bay. Oh dear.

Very poor sound insulation and very noisy guests.

From 11.30pm to 1.30am adults shouting, swearing, kids screaming. While we expected some noise, the amount of noisy adults, kids, TVs and lack of sound insulation is just horrendous.

You can hear neighbours TV and conversation very clearly up until 1.15am and again when they are up at 7am. The other neighbour played drum and bass until 1am. The effect of security coming is only temporary. We can hear our neighbours in all of our rooms (two bedrooms and bathroom).

Impossible to get decent sleep or even sleep in.

Oyster bay consists of very long rows of run-down flats with very large ""fish bowl""window. You""ll need to keep the curtains closed though as multiple other residents walk right past the windows. The upper walkways aren't level and there are many cracks, it doesn't look or feel safe. The flats opposite are really close adding to noise issues.

All-in all,the noisy accommodation and lack of sleep is ruining the holiday.

Think very carefully before booking Oyster Bay.

We tried moving but site full. Considering leaving but paid £600 for 3 nights.

Butlins should show photos of the outside of these flats. We would never have gone.

Some people are a little worried about it being pricey, well it is not a Burger Joint and attention to detail is number one here. To put it into perspective four of us enjoyed an evening meal, with a good French Wine and the bill was just pennies over £100, so £25 each for our most enjoyable meal. You can also enjoy an economical lunch with prices to suit.
We four will be going back to sample more dishes as the summer looms ahead, hopefully!

Noisy outside bedroom windows at front and car doors slamming at all hours.
Breakfast on friday was good, hubby wanted kippers no problem. However saturday very young staff serving one did not know what a kipper was? when it was finally sorted, weand another guest were told you were lucky you got them yesterday as we charge £5.95 extra for them? At over £400 2 rooms 2 night stay to pay extra for a kipper was a bit much, only the full english type buffet is in with the price. Also the way the breakfast was set out is a bit chaotic, people were looking around themselves for glasses for juice, milk etc all spread over in different places and rooms. Had to call a guy over twice to ask for Tea/Coffee as none was on offer and he spent another 10 minutes chatting to the girl staff then forgot to bring milk, so not happy about service, more training should be given to all the teenage staff on busy mornings.

 and 2 x sweet and sour dishes in containers 2/3 the size of anywhere else and minum content. I threw away the chicken and sweetcorn soup which had caught so only tasted of burnt sesame oil.

When asked if we wanted parmesan, the waitress leant straight over in front of one of the party and over her plate, her elbow less than an inch from her face, to reach my plate. Seems like an update in staff training with regards to hospitality is needed. When told it was my birthday, they did not think to say a simple 'happy birthday', just muttered and walked off! Staff did not say even a 'thank you' when we paid the bill and left. Sadly, you have lost a loyal customer.

We had a 20minute wait to get the keys as the caravan wasnt ready. We found drugs in the kitchen cupboard, used straws and lollipop sticks under the bed, creams under the sink. It was filthy. The kichten blind was broken,the toilet blind fell off and the window in the double bedroom had a 2inch gap at the top where it had dropped. There was cigarette butts everywhere around the caravan. We complained to reception, security came to take the drugs. Someone did come and fix the window. The kitchen blind wasnt fixed and the toilet blind was just hung back up but only resting on the clips. We wasnt even offered an alternative caravan. And was told ""the cleaners only clean what they see."" The water went off on the Tuesday, we had no communication until I received I text on the Wednesday at 10am. Luckily we had spoken to the security guard and he had explained what was happening. All we heard from reception all week was it's not our fault. We had to buy our own bottled water for drinks. I've complained again since coming home and have been told we could have used the toilets in the complex. We were the furthest point away from the complex with a 4 year old and our elderly parents, that all use the toilet throughout the night. The complex dont open through the night!!

 We found the Norfolk Arms Hotel and its small restaurant (The Castle?), which is on the right of the hotel arch as you look at it. Not to be confused with the other restaurant on the left.

Its a small restaurant, with one member of staff, therefore the service was slow, really slow. The walls had a history of the hotel on them which gave you something to read while waiting.

So why the good review, well the staff member was lovely, just over worked, BUT the burgers were the best we have had in a while and were worth waiting for.

If you can wait, it was about 45-50 minutes, just for a nice beer and an excellent burger, it was worth it.

The beautiful location almost guarantees plenty of customers for now but they need to be treated with respect if they are to return.

We went for lunch on a busy summer's afternoon. We expected some wait but not so very long - I think they forgot us as once we reminded them we were still waiting, our starter did eventually appear.

The prawn and avocado cocktail was the poorest we've ever tasted. Obviously quickly thrown together- a chunk of avocado, one prawn, chopped vegetables in a vinegary sauce served with stale bread.

They then mixed up our steaks and as we had ordered them cooked differently with different sauces it was not practical to swap. The so called triple cooked chips were flat. The meal was so poor we couldn't face ordering a pudding. We just wanted to leave.

Our table was near the bar and all the time we were sitting there - and it was a long time - we couldn't hear ourselves speak as there was so much noise from the staff constantly loading the glasses into the dishwasher trays and throwing empty bottles into a container.

The girls behind the bar were not great - could do with being taught how to smile and be pleasant to customers as we noticed they were quite curt with some people who had a few queries re the menu.

Main courses included Dover sole which contained so many bones it was inedible . This was replaced with a meal of smoked haddock which my son said smelled off & did not get eaten. Another person who had the haddock said it was over cooked & the spinach was crunchy with sand or earth
My husband had the duck which was over cooked. The ribs were only average, not really smoked correctly.

It was interesting to discover that much of the stonework is fake - it can be cleverly carved wood instead.

We met a helpful gardener in the greenhouse who explained the control of insects by natural predators and the nutritional needs of the large grape vines. That led us to talk about compost and rats that like their accommodation centrally heated.

We even got some tips about how the Wisteria on our abandoned gazebo would flourish if left to grow wild and the age at which a Magnolia would first flower.

2237,Six Bells,Food,Littlehampton, Pub/Bar,3,Appalling service,"There is a first time for everything. And what I mean by that, is that I’ve never experienced such awkward, inadequate and appalling service. Me, my partner, (she is vegetarian) her brother and Dad, visited here for some lunch. Painting the picture for you. We entered through the rear of the building, with no signage to suggest any sort of entrance, we chanced it and found the entrance via the back as stated. Upon entering, we were greeted by a waitress asking if we booked a table. We did not, so they went off to see if they had a table available for the 4 of us. Whilst waiting several minutes, within that timeframe we were asked if we’d like to get some drinks. It was just myself and my partners dad that ordered a drink, and the (what we believe to be) landlady named Tracey had given my partner and her brother a funny look for not wanting a drink. Once me and her dad had received our drinks, a group of customers came in. They were warmly greeted and received drinks and seated before us. Fair enough if they reserved a table. Once we were seated, my partner had seen that there was only 1 vegetarian option available on the Mains section, which she did not want, and preferred to not eat anything. This was because, I asked a passing waitress if there were any vegetarian options, and that was the only one available. I understand that it was Father’s Day and it was most likely a temporary set menu. However, when it states on trip advisor itself that it’s vegetarian friendly, we didn’t expect that. More to the point, we asked if we’d like to order by the waitress, and we asked for a few more minutes. The landlady Tracey came over to take our order. Myself, my partners brother and dad wanted to order and not my partner as mentioned. However, Tracey said something along the lines of “ i can’t have a table for four people, only ordering three meals and two drinks”. This came across very rudely, and we were speechless. Our response was, that there were limited vegetarian options and my partner didn’t want what was offered on that menu. Tracey suggested something off of the starter menu, minus the cheese because my partner cannot have cheese, insisting she orders something, again coming across very aggressive this time. Anyhow, the offer was refused, and Tracey said she’ll just put the order through and snatched the menus from the table. After discussing what just happened, we decided to leave and take our custom elsewhere. As we were we leaving, we told the waitress why. (Because of the poor service) and left with Tracey, hearing and asking if we were going to pay for the drinks, that we already bought at the bar, in which she served us. Also, over £9.00 for 2 pints, definitely over charged? Given my partners family is from Eastern Europe, I’d assume she is a xenophobe.

2241,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,10,Total let down.,"We have been visiting Butlins Skegness as a family for many years now and decided to try Bognor as a change for 2019. This was a mistake on our part. This is the holiday of ""No you can't."" The water park was much smaller than we imagined after it's billing. Once inside some of the slides have a manufacturer recommendation of no under 18s. So a 6 foot 2 17 year old lad at 15 stone is ok, but a 5 foot lady of 40 is barred? Makes sense. Never seen a slide with that disclaimer. Rammed beyond belief, our two young children bumped and bashed over constantly. The rooms were not as clean as expected and for self catering we were used to having basic things such as the fridge being switched on ready so we could put our food in, especially in hot weather and a tin opener. Shame this Butlins didn't consider that. The forks had thick black residue on the sides of the prongs. Horrible. TV didn't work for full duration. The whole place has been packed like sardines. Way too many people here. Intimidating when you are only three and in a huge crowded area for a show. Plus no account for disabilities. My wife had only standing room for one event. Red Coats just stare blankly when asked for help or reasons. The amount of smokers walking around and not in the smoking areas in a family park was surprising. I could go on, kids being refused autographs as they has bought the ""wrong"" merchandise (over double the price) of the goods that were allowed was really the last straw. Particular mention to Braydon here who gave some nonsense about the type of pen being used until I told him I work with autographs and then admitted he didn't really know why and walked off when I told him what a poor time we were having in general. We won't be back, a real shame as this was a celebration of a family members return to health after a horrendous 18 months. Gandeys Circus was good, except for that the children's foam hands were stolen from under their seats. Will be looking forward to going home. If we are to make it back to Butlins, it won't be here.

Firstly stowford press cider was great equally had a cider for that long. Thirst quenching. That and a pint for my other half was £8. I thought that was quite reasonable as the rabbit always had a rep for being over priced.

We had whitebait and camembert to start (shared) I haven't had whitebait for a long time (theme here isn't there lol) and had been fancying it for weeks. I wasn't disappointed.

For main I ordered something I have never ordered in a pub, fish and chips! I try to stay away from fish and chips in a pub or out to eat as I usually think what's the point as it's cheaper and better at the local chip shop.... Well I was wrong! Gorgeous piece of fish the badger batter was scrummy and so crisp not too oily. The triple cooked chips were to die for.

In my opinion the rate I took from the call centre after struggling for 3 days on the web, was over charged, especially as the first price quoted before I complained bitterly, was £1,116. I explained as the web page was not working the rate went up from £732 to what I got eventually which was £876. I did complain but was told it was due to availabeilty, which was odd, as the follow days when I got the web page to work, it was cheaper, but the $876 brought me a no cancelation clause. Then came the hotel experience, the twin room had to be changed after checking in, my in laws notice sewage in the bath tub, this was I am told due to a blockage. There were no engineers on the weekend, but the room was eventually changed after being told there were no twin rooms left. Perhaps a misunderstanding, meaning on the ground floor. The doubke room was extremely small, perhpas smaller than advertised and looking a little ""sad"" and well used. The safe battaey needed changing, but after reminding the reception staff, 3 days later it still had not been changed. The staff are very young and in desperate need of training, they never smile, say hello or ask how things are going. There were exceptions of course, but rare. The breakfast had a good variety and was well presented, with additional items for purchase. The hotel location is also very nice. Please note it seems to be a wedding hotel, so Friday and Saturday nights are extremely loud with more than you fair share of people with a little more to drink than normal perhaps.

The two Ploughmans however, were fine, nice big pieces of cheese. But the 'piece de resistance' was the treacle tart. Yes I am joking. There was no treacle in the treacle tart.

Waiters and waitresses were very attentive, friendly and helpful. Couldn’t have asked for more from them.

However- that’s all the positives out the way. For around £27 per person per head- I had a couple of pints of coke, nachos starter, Double stack burger, and crumble desert.

Nachos- were disgusting. Cheap quality. Disgusting fake cheese. Guacamole straight out of a jar and lumps of tomato dumped onto the plate (once it’s been nuked in a microwave). It was bland and tasteless... it’s so easy to make Guacamole & Salsa- why the hell is it not made fresh?! And the cheese... jeeze, use REAL cheese!!

The Double Stack Burger- was ok. Burger was burnt, but actually tasted average. Definitely had better burgers- but it was not bad. However- all my parties chips were brown, did not taste or look fresh and were basically ‘just about’ warm... so pretty pathetic in reflection.

The Apple & Berry Crumble was a huge disappointment. Again heating of the custard seems to be an issue- barely warm it was. The crumble topping was nice- the rest was more like a soup. Pretty awful!!

I have been to many restaurants that serve much much better quality food for half the price. This restaurant is totally overpriced and not worth it. The food is very poor quality, lazily prepared and ‘slopped’ together. Do not expect anything of quality or fresh.",2,4.0,2.0,British,1

Then when my friend and I got changed to use the swimming pool couldn't use it as there was aqua swim fitness class going on in the pool.

We then had to chose what time to have lunch and our beauty treatments were 2pm and 3pm, so that day we couldn't even use the pool. We had also been told by other people in the room that you had to get changed back into your clothes to eat lunch? We had to keep asking about everything which seemed that there was no organisation.

Unless your under 5'6 you better hope for a ground floor. Much preferred the old pool. New one is more for toddlers I feel and my 8 year old got bored very quickly. Drinks are expensive and decor hasn't changed at all. Pigeons flying around inside and pigeon poo on the floor. Its very very run down. Needs a total shut down and revamp.

2300,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,28,Summer holiday,"We are Butlins regulars having previously visited both minehead and Skegness as we have not been to Bognor before, we decided to give it a go. While they offer the full set of activities, the same as the other two, this site is our least favorite. It seems to be a lot smaller and less organized. Everything feels crammed in with a lack of areas around the accommodation where kids can play. If your kids want to kick a ball, you have too walk to the other side of the site. The site feels dirtier, lots of litter around and they don’t seem to keep up with maintenance as well with the accommodation feels old and falling into disrepair. The staff are really friendly and helpful but the site itself just feels old and dirty. The queues to get into places are long, upto 45 minutes to get into the swimming pool at times, and the food courts feels as though it is under staffed with having to wait for food to be bought out at the buffet and tables to be cleared. The staff look stressed and hassled, just not enough people to get the job done and the manager of the food court seems to be like a deer caught in the headlights.

As a family, we love Butlin’s and everything they have to offer to especially to keep kids busy and active, but when we come to book again for next year, it will definitely be either Skegness or Minehead. In our opinion, Skegness is by far the best, it is just a shame that it is the furthest away from us.

I read that the rooms were of a poor standard, however renovation was being done, so I rang and requested a newly decorated room, this was ok but nothing special and obviously a makeover doesnt extend to flaking paint on window frames, wasnt impressed with the cleaning of the room, lots of cobwebs that had obviously been there some time.
The hotel needs a major overhaul, the paintwork, decoration and carpets in most areas is apalling. The creakibg floor boards in the corridors were awful, how the people staying in those rooms got any rest is beyond me!
Price of drinks is quite expensive. We ordered two cocktails and when the waitress bought them over, she spilt most of one on the table and down my husbands trousers, she never even came back to clean the table, and we had to ask for it to be cleaned.
Food was quite good, not much choice on the menu for a Saturday evening though.

On Butlin's dine around package and the wife only wanted a small pizza.

Waitress: No madam you can only have a medium pizza on dinearound.

Me: No No the wife won’t eat all a Medium pizza, a small will just be fine otherwise it’s a waste of food.

Waitress: No you MUST have a medium.

Me: No No you have a corporate responsibility not to waste food we will only have a small.

At which point the waitress stormed off without taking our order and shouted after the manager in a hissy fit. No I will be back in a minute Sir or let me check with the manager Sir. Just a full on childish tantrum from the waitress.

All for asking for less food for the money we are paying. There are people in this world that can’t afford to eat and this waitress wants to just waste food and throw tantrums. Where is your CSR policy papa Johns/Butlins. The waitress then refused to serve us for the rest of the meal, most likely due to her own embarrassment. No apology given for her utter childish performance.

2324,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,67,Second visit to Butlins,"This was our second visit to Butlins for a Just for tots week. We visited last year and gave a 5/5 review.

Swimming Pool 5/5
This was absolutely fantastic. Our toddler loved it and have to say it looks amazing inside. It really is perfect for toddlers.

Butlins Staff 5/5
Every member of staff we met were lovely and couldn't be more helpful. They really are a credit to Butlins. It really helps with the overall experience.

General Entertainment 5/5
There was so much to do here. My son loved all the rides. Also helped that the staff were giving out high fives etc.

Arcades
Have to say the position of the arcade was not helpful in the skyline. It was more of an issue this year as my son is that bit older. I found many of the machines unethical to be honest. They were made appealing to children yet had major similarities to adult gambling machines. I felt it is early conditioning of children by the gambling industry. We shouldn't have to walk past these when having to get anywhere within the skyline. Please re think this Butlins if you read this. Or at the very least remove the machines which are clearly children's versions of adult gambling machines from the main part of the Skyline.

Room Cleanliness: 2/5
On arrival to the room there were skid marks in the toilet bowl and urine on top of the toilet . Also sticky chocolate stuck to back of sofa (at least I hope it was chocolate). However the house keeping staff we bumped in to were all friendly and helpful. Maybe there is too much pressure on them/not enough staff to get the rooms ready on time? Regardless that's not a nice start to the holiday.

Gold appartments 3/5
Feels a bit dated. The shower is absolutely hopeless. No where near enough power. Beds were too high for a toddler. Matress on single beds were too thick for a bed guard to he used safely. Due to this my wife slept in the other single bed for when my son woke up during the night.

The Yacht club premium dining 3/5.
This irritated me. Last year we went premium dining and were allocated the Deck Restaurant which was fantastic. The Deck had live cooking stations and a separate section, with a good selection of children's meals. The Yacht club did not have either. How can both restaurants be charged at the same rate? There is literally no comparison. You are allocated the restaurant on arrival. We assumed it would be comparable with the Deck. We can't help but feel hard done by. This simply isn't fair as we still paid the for the full premium dining package. However it must be noted all staff in the restaurant were friendly and helpful.

Overall the entertainment was fantastic and my son had a great time. Please Butlins review premium dining, room cleanliness and the arcade issues

Arrived and went in for drinks , got these apart from a couple and they said they would bring over to table. Poppadum's ordered and chutneys and they arrived. Then main meals ordered. One couple wanted onion bhajis for starter. We still hadn't the drinks previously ordered, I had to go to the bar and remind them and wait. Not ideal. However starter arrived and obviously there was a wait in between no an issue. Then two vegan meals came out with out rice but the girls started to eat as hungry. We waited and waited and eventually a prawn curry x 2 arrived still no rice or naan bread The curry was congealed around the edge implying that it had been microwaved, and hubbie was looking through and could only find 4 prawns not a lot between 2 of us. To this time others had still not received their meals then the sides came out in drips and drabs and the rice still hadn't arrived!! You can imagine by this time we were very disappointed a birthday celebration that it was supposed to be, degenerated into a farce. My son got extremely cross as did my husband and we complained fiercely. By this time we were so disgusted with the meal and the terrible service and fact it hadn't come on time or was hot we did not wish to continue . The manager Michael came out and apologized but did not offer for me to be replaced he then disappeared. Needless to say this all ruined our experience and we had felt embarrassed as we had recommended the restaurant to our family.

So when we arrive the rooms were dirty fag burns in the carpet black mould in the bathroom the bathroom floor kept filling with water no one had even been in there using it so was leaky pipes. Went out that night with me my partner and 4 children I bought 6 drinks 4 soft drinks coke and 2 alcoholic drinks that came to £30 which I think is expensive plus a pizza on way back to Chalet got a pizza and 3 side and a drink £45. I wasn’t bothered about the cost at that point but thought it was expensive. We are inside when we hear shouting outside there is a women 4 young children 1 a baby there had been a fight and her husband had been arrested thought what a loverly place. So we wake up in the morning my partner suffers with really bad anxiety she realised that she forgot her tablets so on that on its own she became anxious she went off to try clear her head I then get a phone call saying we have an hour to get off the site because she was about to smoke in none smoking area she was walking to our car which was still on site but far away from anyone or anything the fag wasn’t even lit. So we waited for for someone to come then 5 big blokes all come up to remove my partner from site DISGUSTING people they had took her Wristband so she wouldn’t of been able to go in anywhere so this has all gone on I said so what about the people downstairs they used Physical violence the night before and you’re coming up here to remove my partner from our chalet I think you’re disgusting people. Then I said I can stay with my four children but my partner has to go who in their right mind is going to kick people off of their holiday camp on Christmas Eve there’s not much more to say but I am making formal complaints to managers and I’ll also be going to local papers to expose how disgusting the place actually is. If you look at all the crime around Bognor Regis Butlins result there is higher crime within the result stay clear disgusting place. AVOID AT ALL COST we spent less than 24 hours there they would not refund any money so they had nearly a £800 off me in less than 24 hours cost off accommodation £650
Spent £50 in there onsite shop
£120 on first night there
So £720 on that site without travel expenses included.
Also the plan was to spend Xmas at Butlins so was not prepared to be thrown off site on Xmas eve they also said that we will not be getting any refund. I think in total Butlins Bognor have cost me around £1000 for less than 24 hours.

First the guy serving Mr personanaly, not even a hello good morning so I cheerfully said good morning, I got a good morning back, amazing, I'm coming to spend money in your pub.
Went to get 2 coffees from the coffee jug only enough for 1 left in jug, went to inform same guy said he would would bring a refill out, meanwhile my other cup left on the bar, after 5 min noticed the jug had been refilled, we were sitting next to the bar, went to the bar to ask for the other cup, felt embarrassed to ask the 2 staff standing with backs to the bar as they were eating the breakfast filled baps, had to ask for my cup in the end.
The breakfast came not what I had asked for the vegetarian should have been sizzling, politely said this to same guy, he did offer to change this said no its OK.
The breakfasts were all luke warm the sausages were white, the eggs were lovely, could not be bothered to complain again.
As we left my wife said goodbye no response.
I do hope the Rd reads this, we are happy cheerfully people left this pub feeling deflated.
Perhaps training is needed, I can give a list of pubs where the experience is fantastic.

2351,The Diner,Food,Bognor, Steakhouse/Diner,1,"Excruciatingly slow service, average food","Like some other reviewers on here, we as a family of 6 also experienced extremely poor and slow service. We had pre-booked a table for 6:15 two days earlier but it was 50 minutes before our drinks order arrived at our table, even though we could see the tray sitting on the bar counter for about 15 minutes. There were several staff rushing about but the phrase “headless chickens” would seem appropriate here as they didn’t seem to actually be DOING anything other than trying to look busy and keep moving! The diner wasn’t at maximum capacity by any means.

Our food finally arrived about 1.5 hours after we’d been seated. Our 5 year old and 2 year old granddaughters had to be given snacks by their mum whilst waiting for the food as they were hungry by then and understandably bored by the wait. Well behaved nonetheless. The food itself was average at best and not great value for money. We decided we would all like a dessert afterwards but by the time the waitress was ready to take our order (at least another half an hour after our table was cleared), we had all lost patience and this unacceptable delay meant our granddaughters had already missed the tots disco on their last night that they’d been so looking forward to.

In summary, it would seem some cover times are more efficiently managed than others (avoid Thursday evenings!). The food is average. Staff not particularly friendly and certainly not helpful. The place is not child friendly in terms of waiting times. Allow at least 2 to 2.5 hours if you plan on a timed activity afterwards. The manager needs replacing asap if this restaurant wants to turn a profit. Just our table alone lost them six desserts’ worth of business.

What turned up was all but two mains with no starters. Waiter said that the starters and main were coming together but kitchen told to hold two mains. Very strange, we said they might as well cancel starters. 5 of us started eating but one was cold so went back and my daughter was missing her side order. No one came over to explain. The other two mains turned up about 10 mins later. Had to ask for daughters side order - again... one of the later meals had to go back as it was cold and had no fries on plate. When it came back it still had no fries!
Daughters side order turned up after 3 requests but they had put warm sweet corn (that she hadn’t ordered) and warm garlic bread on top of cucumber which she then wouldn’t eat as it was v unpleasant...
Floor manager explanation was that quite often people order starters and mains to come together - really?! Why would this be presumed?! Wasn’t v apologetic. Then agreed to take 20% off bill.

Then we were taken off to separate rooms and it was at this point I was told that they have no facility for two people together.
Pedicure was done with me lying down so not sure how I could have sipped fizz or a cuppa!
During the application of the the nail polish I was told it was too thick to continue as the bottle was nearly finished. They did not have any more. The beautician then added something to dilute it.
There was no option for gel polish so we were told to wait in a dark cold room for 45 minutes until we could put our shoes back on.
I feel that £126 was not reflected in the quality or experience.

2368,Establo Lounge,Food,Littlehampton, Pub/Bar,4,Weird ,"Weird experience, not quite sure what the market is for them - advertise tapas which is Spanish for food and talk...the food wasn’t remotely Spanish - too much oil (it’s not portugal).

The food is so varied - burgers and other mains you may as well go elsewhere because it’s better value for money for the quality.

Staff weren’t the passionate exciting staff I’m used to in other “tapas” USP bars. They looked bored.

The catchment market and the people that go there don’t match the atmosphere, the housy style music for the “entitled” youngsters that feel they’re important in there doesn’t equate the the clientele that sit there in the day paying for over priced coffee like costa.

Considering I’m never in the UK but this place is an example of why I hate being here so much and rather travel to authentic real places - won’t be returning any time soon, weird atmosphere, weird concept and the clientele ruin the place.

A real Spanish tapas and wine bar would be a great catch in Rustington - the clientele is there for it - just seems like the leakage from the lamb down the other end has come here for a “exquisite” setting

Service was jovial but distracted. Food happened before drinks.

Food was disappointing. We were encouraged to go for the buffet. Starters were cold. Satay chicken dried out/overcooked.

Curries were too sweet and gloopy. Tasted of supermarket bought curry paste.

We have travelled round Thailand and sampled a wide range of thai food, and we are perhaps spoiled by living in London with some very good, authentic thai restaurants nearby.

2388,Ocean Hotel & Spa,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,35,Great Family Hotel,"Stayed at the Ocean Hotel between Christmas and New Year.

We added on the dining option and made full use of the vouchers. Instead of dining in the Kaleidoscope we ate in The Diner, Papa Johns and The Beachcomber. A little known fact is that you can also ‘dine around’ for `breakfast - we chose to have all of our breakfasts in the Beacomber, with 4 teenagers in our party it allowed them extra time in bed and was nice to have the food served to you rather than buffet style.

The hotel rooms were clean and beds were comfy. Quite a few stains on the hallways carpets.

Staff were excellent. Fast check-in service, lovely room cleaning staff who were pleased to help and the Butlin’s Butlers, especially Terry - fantastic every time we visit.

Not enough lifts! Especially when shows finish, we counteracted this by having a night cap and game of cards in the Kaleidoscope , but lifts were chaos at check in and departure days. We decided to take the cases down to the car the night before checkout, so we only had a bag to drop down in the morning and could use the stairs.

Did not use the Spa this time, but have done so many times before and thouroughly enjoyed each visit. New swimming pool that opens this year looks fantastic.

All in all, another fantastic trip. Seeing as my kids are 19 and 14 it’ll probably be the last time we visit for a long while. Sad to say goodbye, but thanks for all the amazing memories!",4,1.0,2.0,0,0

2394,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,11,Christmas Fantasy,"We visited on 14th December 2018 for the Christmas Fantasy experience. We stayed in a self catering apartment in Guillemot way and it was very basic and in need of some thorough cleaning/repairs and TLC.
We arrived a bit late on the Friday and struggled to get parked, I had to get out leaving my partner with the car and kids in order to grab the keys and welcome pack to get in to our apartment as we couldn't find anywhere near to park. It was dark and I struggled to find guest services as I had never been there before (they do not have drive in check in desks like they do in Skegness).
We eventually found our apartment and it was really quite far for us to walk with all our belongings, a baby and two toddlers.
The parking situation is terrible, you have to get there early to get a space, we got there about 8pm and it was stressful trying to offload our belongings, our family and finding a space to park.
The first full day the weather was bad and all the outdoor activities were cancelled which meant that everyone was crammed in to the Skyline and it was horrific, the soft play area was bursting at the seams and we could see children getting knocked over by kids running past so we didn't let ours go in (much to their disappointment), there was not enough tables for us to sit down at and it was hard to see anything on stage as everyone was standing at the sides so you couldn't see anything let alone the toddlers trying to see. It was a struggle walking past as there were people EVERYWHERE trying to watch the entertainment and blocking the way past. There were queues for most things and a noticeable amount of parents having a lot to drink and ignoring their feral children, sometimes you would hear some of them swearing loudly and it made me feel uncomfortable as I don't want my children to be exposed to language like that.
In our guest pack we received tickets to see Santa in the Character theatre at 7pm on Saturday 15th Dec (which I thought was a bit late for a 2 and 4 year old), we assumed there was a show but when we got there we just got in to a long queue on the left hand side of the theatre, the kids called out for Santa who came out on a stage, then just sat down with the kids in their respective family groups on stage, had a brief chat with them, gave them a chocolate selection box and posed for a photo before being told to exit the other side of the stage. A couple of minutes at the most, pretty disappointing.
I have since found out from other people who went at the same time as us, that they all saw a Christmas show in the theatre or had a private Santa experience in his grotto so I'm baffled as to why we didn't receive either of those experiences.
We ate at Papa J's restaurant, it wasn't particularly busy and a few things were forgotten by the staff I.e. plates for the children despite asking for them twice so my partner and I ate our meals off the plates the starters came on. The food was absolutely delicious and fairly good value for money in comparison to some of the other places, I would definitely recommend eating here.
The swimming pool changing rooms were dirty, like really dirty and not necessarily from people using it that day but in desperate need of a deep clean. There were dirty nappies on the floor, bodily fluids including blood smears and bogeys on the walls and the floor was filthy.
I didn't see anyone cleaning in there at any stage, not even wiping the changing room floor which meant we had to put towels down in order to get changed and not get completely covered in dirt which meant our towels were so dirty we couldn't go swimming again during our stay.
We had forgotten the baby's swimming costume and had to look for a suitable suit, well there was only a pair of cheaply made trunks (nothing else in his size) and it cost us £10!!! I mean come on, his little swimsuit from Next didn't even cost that much, it really did take me aback but needs must. Well the trunks didn't fit him in the slightest they were massively too big and kept falling down, I feel that this aspect should be looked in to by Butlins as the trunks were incorrectly sized and extortionate, almost taking advantage of people who have no alternative.
During our time in the pool my partner took my little boy to the loo where a two young lads (one was a lifeguard and the other was dressed all in red) were having a loud conversation about one of the lads having an STI!!! Thankfully my little boy wasn't listening as we didn't fancy explaining to him what an STI was and it's a wholly inappropriate conversation to be having in a place mainly full of children.
By Sunday we had had enough so went off the site and went to Bognor beach and pier for the day and ate in a local pub, The Regis (Brewers fayre) which also had a soft play inside which the kids loved, we returned back to Butlins and decided to pack up and leave early (was due to stay until Monday).
All in all a bit of a let down and wouldn't recommend.

2406,Cardanom Bay,Food,Bognor, Restaurant,33,"Amazing food, worst service ever","Let me start by congratulating the chefs at Cardamon Bay tonight for producing absolutely wonderful looking and tasting food, in a very timely manner from when our order was taken, despite a busy Mother's Day service.
However, I can only rate our experience as 1 for the following reasons:
We waited ages to order our food, and eventually had to rather obviously flag someone down.
When I was deliberating over a suitable vegetable dish for my children, I was basically told by a waiter to hurry up because he had other orders to take; it was said in the nicest possible way so I just assumed that he was feeling pressurised and thought no more of it.
However the rudeness continued. When my husband ordered a drink when the food arrived, we were left with no drinks at all until the end of the meal, my older children were sharing out the baby's drink, and my husband was gesturing to the manager at the bar, who kept looking up, then looking away. I managed to catch another member of staff, but after my first sentence, she asked me to ""wait one minute"", ran off, and we couldn't catch another member of staff for at least 5-10 minutes. The member of staff who did eventually take our drinks order was then rude to my husband.
There was also a small incident while we were there. A member of staff accidentally dropped a glass container/bottle which shattered very near a sleeping baby in a carrier, near our table and right next to another customer. The manager asked everyone nearby not to move while they cleaned up, and then proceeded to loudly berate the waitress in her mother tongue, until he noticed people looking and promptly became nicey nicey.
Overall it appeared that members of staff had been given roles that they were not allowed to deviate from despite the obvious need for multitasking and this was unchecked, some members of waiting staff were rude and under pressure and this was unchecked, some front of house staff may not have had the language skills necessary for interaction with and service of customers especially during a busy service, the manager showed very poor form in his treatment of his staff member who had had the accident with glass and he was commanding to my husband when we entirely decided to cancel our second drinks order and pay the bill at the door on exit whilst explaining why we were so disappointed with our experience.
Such a shame. The kitchen team handled the busy service and turned out some gorgeous food, but it was an epic fail for the front of house team led (or not) by their manager. The worst service we've experienced anywhere at least for the last 10 years, if not more.",1,1.0,0.0,Indian,1

It was an impressive plate of food with good portions, and looked great till i tucked in. The veg was undercooked and cold, the nut roast was pale and very bland tasting, and nothing like a nut roast i have ever had before. I asked for some more gravy, and what turned up was the worst gravy i have ever tasted. It was the right colour. but had no taste at all, and was just awful. I tried to eat some of it, but gave up, as it was so cold and tasteless. Other people at the table also said the food was very bland and cold.

I rarely complain about food, but on this occasion, I returned the food, and was given a full refund. It has put me off returning there again.

They need to look at the experience of the chef, as i think that is the worst roast dinner i have ever had in a pub.

We were stressed tired and fed up when we came across 2 security guards Mark and cassie. I cannot thank these people enough for their help assistance and compassion. They found a member of hotel staff to allocate us an adapted room. Cassie was especially good with my mom who is disabled due to a brain tumour. She pushed her wheelchair and spoke to her with genuine interest and respect. She oriented my mom to our room turning on lights and shutting curtains tiny things that made a massive difference.

2469,"Crossbush, Beefeater",Food,Arundel, Steakhouse/Diner,2,Very Disappointing Birthday Breakfast,"The standards we have experienced on previous visits here have all but disappeared.

This visit was for a family member's breakfast for seven of us. On arrival we were eventually greeted and told that there was no record of any pre-booking, however, we were eventually taken to a seating area which was away from the main area and nobody else seated in there which made it feel a little unwelcoming to start with.

After a while a waitress appeared and took our breakfast orders. There was no welcome smile or warm reception from her in fact she was quite offhand and abrupt.

In the meantime we went to the self-service breakfast bar which was in bit of a mess and was urgently needing some attention from the staff.We had to request decaffeinated coffee for two of us from a staff member and after a short wait he appeared with one single sachet of decaff coffee despite two of us requiring it! So off he trots and returns with a second sachet, not any to stock up the table. The fruit salad that we had was just about edible as the orange segments were extremely tough and bitter.

After a considerable wait some of the cooked breakfast meals arrived at the table albeit different to the orders we placed. There was no offer from the waitress to resolve the mix up this so we sorted it as such by swapping items from plate to plate. The food itself was just about warm but just about edible. After another wait the remaining outstanding meals arrived which were as ordered. Again they food wasn't very hot. We proceeded to eat the breakfast which was nowhere as good as it had been on previous visits. The bacon flavour was tainted by what tasted like steak from the griddle. The eggs were a little undercooked and so it went on.

My wife ordered poached eggs with bacon and tomato which when it turned up looked lost as it was a small portion served on a full sized plate. So she eat this but decided to order the same again as the first portions served up was very small and the eggs weren't cooked that well. After a wait of 15 minutes or more her reorder eventually arrived at the table but way after everybody else had finished their food. This felt awkward to her but she did reluctantly eat it only because we persuaded her to. This food was also only just warm so again very disappointing.

For what we paid, the whole breakfast this time didn't feel like good value for money and the unwelcoming service from the staff really spoilt what should have been a happy family occasion. We didn't wish to remain in the restaurant anymore so settled the bill and left.

As a result of this very disappointing visit, it's very unlikely that we will be returning there very soon for another family visit.

We came pretty early (just after 5pm) and it wasn’t busy at all, only a handful of other tables busy.

The waiter wasn’t friendly at all, we didn’t even get a smile.

The waitress struggled to remember which drink was which, there was only 5 drinks, 2 diet cokes, 1 normal. The normal had a lemon, the diet had lime but she somehow couldn’t figure out which 2 were the same?! ‍♀️

The starters came relatively quick but the tato tots were really salty which wasn’t nice at all.

After 1h 10 since arriving at the restaurant, we then complained our meals hadn’t arrived. 4 out of 5 of them then arrived a minute later. The chips were cold on mine, my friend’s chicken was so over cooked she couldn’t even cut it and another’s bacon was also over cooked.

We complained and asked where the last meal was. Didn’t get much of a sorry, it felt like they were annoyed we complained.

The missing meal arrived 10 mins later, it was only nachos so you’d think you couldn’t go wrong, but there was virtually no cheese on it.

They then brought some more chips for me and another chicken meal, but at this point I’d finished my burger and didn’t really want the chips.

We would have had desserts but at this point had been in there so long and were so unimpressed we didn’t see the point in waiting to see how they could mess up that!

We got the bill (reduced thankfully, although should really have been free after all that), paid some in cash and asked to pay the remaining £18 on card, split half each. This ended up being £8 on the first card and £10 on the second. How is it hard to half £18?!

2490,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,1,Be careful when ordering the Premium dining plan - you don't get what is advertised on the Butlins website,"My family and I saved up for a few days in Butlins last December and as a treat paid for the Premium dining plan. What is advertised on their website isn't what we got. They advertise a carvery, live cooking stations and theme nights including Tex-Mex, Italian, Indian and Chinese. We saw none of these and on phoning Butlins we were initially told that due to an overspill we were given Food Court dining by mistake. On complaining we were then told we were miss-advised and we did get Premium dining even though we didn't even get a sniff of any of the above. You will also waste your time with the complaints department as they need a complaints department to deal with the complaints about their complaints department. If they have done this to us then how many other families have not got what they paid for? A totally shocking experience from what is supposed to be a family based company.
I am now having to go through the legal route due to the false advertising on their website and am building a case against them through social media as they just don't care. They also said they could not log this as a complaint as this was not done within the 28 days after our stay even though we have just recently found out that we didn't get the Premium dining as first thought - this is a very sneaky way of keeping their complaints stats down.

2493,Whittingtons Band Stand,Food,Bognor, Fast Food/Takeaway,14,Very poor fish and chips right next to the sea,"We were out for the day and as near to the beach, we thought we would pop to the seafront to get some authentic fish and chips and where better to get them than right on the beach? Well, so we thought.

The kiosk is situated just a matter of feet from the pebbles of the beach with sturdy solid benches literally inches from them so we thought we'd go here as felt like a perfect location. We ordered 'Crispy cod and chips'. Some time later after serving lots of people who had ordered after us but wanted just chips, ours was ready.

As soon as I opened the box my heart sank. It was immediately obvious that it wasn't proper fish and chips. The fish was a pre-made frozen portion, which looked very much like the stuff you get from supermarkets that specialise in frozen foods. You dont need to work in fish and chips to see it (and I have). It was so clear that this was not a fresh piece of fish, drenched in batter and fried there and then. It had been deep fried for sure - it was so drenched in oil that it was glistening in the sun. It was as tasteless as a piece of frozen portion which would expect to be. I should have been suspicious by the 'Crispy Cod and chips' on the menu as it didnt say 'fresh cod and chips' or locally caught etc.

Then there were the chips. They were not authentic chips that you would expect to get from a chippy. They were closer to french fries but fatter, and very uniform in shape more akin to something you would get in a school canteen.

A final minor point - they didn't have enough bottles of sauce, vingear etc out so they were virtually empty and I watched a number of people squirt out mostly air to small amusement as it sounded like blowing raspberries, but meant no sauce.

It was very disappointing. Easily the worst fish and chips that I have paid for, and it really shouldn't be that sort of food being right by the beach in a very British seaside town.

2502,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,1,Tots week,"Just returned from an amazing 5 day holiday at butlin’s with my 2 1/5 year old and partner we had an amazing time.

The swimming pool was fantastic we went first thing in the morning and it was reasonably busy but we all had a a great time in there and also went the afternoon and it was quiet and they had the wave machine on and the flumes where on top we have a great time. They had little tikes ships for younger kids to play on and loads of buckets and watering cans for kids to play with. But for the size of the resort they defiantly need two pools.

The kids rides that where placed inside where absolutely amazing my little girl loved them we couldn’t get her off them the staff running them were outstanding with the kids they went beyond to keep the kids entertained during the ride and if it wasn’t busy they let the kids stay on.

The outdoor parks where great and they where soft flooring so if kids fell over it wasn’t as bad like if they fell over one pavement.

Outdoor funfair looked amazing but didn’t spend time in there as my little girl was too young.

We stayed in the wave hotel and it was amazing very spacious kids bed was very comfy and had it’s on little t.v and had a relaxing blue light which seemed to help my little girl sleep so much better so will defiantly look at getting something for my girls room at home. Kitchen and livening area was very spacious and well equipped t.v was quite small for the distance it was from the sofa but we wasn’t really in the room much and if we was we would just watch telly in bed so weren’t a major issue. Main bed room was very big and very comfy own hair dryer which was a bonus as I forgot mine.

Justin fletcher was absoloultly amazing my little girl loves him and he was very funny and entertains for the kids. We also watch Paddington bear which was really good. Sid Salone was amazing for when we he was on in the evening. Kids disco could have been a bit better but the kids liked it. Queuing to get in for Justin was crazy we joined the queue about 12 and it was t too bad but within 10 mins of standing it quickly picked up but we still got good seats there was a pillar on front but didn’t disrupt us watching the show and there was a small screen to look at if you didn’t want to miss it but there moved all over stage so didn’t make a difference. Paddington queue was the same but there was less people watching Paddington then there was Justin.

We ate out twice as we done self catering as I was easier for us with a young child. We ate in the beachcomber inn which was delicious. Friendly staff and quick service. The food came out quick and the kids menu was good and you got a kids starter for veg stick and bread sticks and dip which was good while the kids were waiting for the mains made it very easier. I found it reasonable price normal pub grub price. We also ate in the diner which was nice too donthibk you need to get there early for a good meal as they shut at half 6 and seemed to rush to get the rest of the meals out for closing time. Also the same price and the beachcomber inn. They all done similar foods.

Overall a great holiday and would definitely go back.

Service was very good, staff were attentive and looked after us well, both our waitress and the manager who popped by several times to make sure we were happy with everything.

We both enjoyed our meals, the food was very well cooked and presented to perfection. However I think the duck breast I had fell a little short: the ""dauphinoise"" potatoes were very bland, and the duck itself would have benefitted from a stronger-flavoured red-wine jus or berries. The terrine I had as a starter was very good, with a nice combination of salads & flavours, but the actual terrine slice itself was minute. All in all, for the price, I expected a little more.

The atmosphere is nice, lots of people there to enjoy a relaxed evening out with friends, many of them dressed quite smartly due to the proximity to Goodwood.

If you are not very mobile, do beware that the stairs to the loos are incredibly narrow and steep, I'm surprised mountain ropes & crampons aren't provided!

Some lovely views and great things to see in the castle itself - lots of steps, particularly in the keep area meant families were struggling but worth the wait and keeping safe on the spiral stairs. The gardens were amazing and the old cork oak at the top of the estate, absolutely stunning. The guides were helpful but generally we kept ourselves to ourselves. I agree it was quite pricey, as was the cafe but not unrealistic- the costs for this place must be phenomenal and such a place is well worth seeing. The re-enactments were fun and enjoyable- again, enthusiasts very happy to include you and help you understand anything that wasn’t clear. Great day all round.

2507,Church Farm,Accommodation,Littlehampton,AccomOther,0,"Terrible experience! dirty, old and wrong caravan, Haven guest relations not professional!","We have booked a Prestige Caravan at Haven Church Farm. arrived Friday after 6pm and we were shocked to see the state of the Caravan, terrible! all dirty, I wrote on the dirt of the windows to show to management. I will upload pictures as I also did send to management. There was a very polite receptionist, Victoria, who understood but said that manager wasn't there, I went to look for the manager 3 times, but I couldn't find him. We decided to avoid staying at the park and organised two trips, one for Saturday to Chichester and one for Sunday to Portsmouth (we end up spending a lot of money but at least we saved the break that supposedly was going to be a fantastic time in a Prestige caravan with decking.
When we left on Monday at 10am, I have spoken to the manager who apologised many times and said that this wasn't acceptable and asked me what I want, I said a voucher to use in the future so we will be able to rent a proper and decent Prestige Caravan for 3 nights, he said ""OK"", after apologising more times I asked him what are you going to give me: 3 nights in a Prestige Caravan or a voucher, he said a voucher, after 4 days I wrote to him and ask about my voucher, he sent an email with a £50 voucher, a complete liar, dishonest person, his name was Sam, the manager.
I have complaint to Guest Relations, no help, very useless and unprofessional, they rise up the refund to £100 then after many more emails they rise to £150 as they said they accept the ""problem with cleaning"" this is not a case for cleaning, first is a case of cheating a customer, allocating a Caravan that not even is acceptable for a standard level. £150 is not acceptable for making us waste our time and push us to make different plans when we travelled with 3 children for more than 4 hours in the car, it was impossible to abandon the break and we use it only for sleeping as it was difficult to move to a different resort as we have a child with special needs who is very difficult to understand transitions, we have explained everything to customer services, guest relations but they don't understand, we are not asking for a free break but to be offered the high amount we paid so we can organise another break in the future and the only amount they want to reimburse if £150, this is less than the third of the amount paid.
Guest Relations are not competent, and I have asked for a general manager to look into this situation, but they just don't give a flying flamingo about this.
Very poor service and the manager Sam a very dishonest person, now is laying he did not offer what he did.
I will never come back to that bad managed holiday park and most likely not using Haven anymore as the guest relations team are so useless, they don't even read my email properly and keep answering their way. terrible experience, please have a look at the pictures of an ""Prestige Caravan""

The new swimming pool area is over the other side of complex which means having to cross the road to get there. Cars driving round like mad at all hours. While in the pool my partner got metal shavings stick in her foot which we had to pull out Nd causing pool to be closed for 15 minutes while they searched the pool and found more.

2521,WWT Wetland,Attractions,Arundel,Nature/Gardens,8,An excellent day out,"If you've ever been to any of the other WWT centres you'll know exactly what to expect. They always seem to be of a high quality and teeming with wildlife. Although this centre is a tad smaller than my local WWT centre in London it is an excellent day out nonetheless and features a boat tour which the London centre does not have to the best of my knowledge.

If you're travelling as a larger group you might want to take a packed lunch. The canteen food is good quality but certainly not good value, I had a cuppa, a sausage roll and shortbread on arrival and ate a proper meal mid afternoon and I had already spent just shy of £20 which would certainly add up if there was a few of you.

That said and this might be an unpopular view but WWT wetland centres are not necessarily ideal places for young children that need to expend energy. Now I know they all make the effort to have an outdoor play area, bird feeding area and nature trail of sorts but the other 90% of the centre is inhabited by twitchers who take their hobby very very seriously. For the most part you need to carry yourself as close to near silence as possible, this is a natural habitat for wild birds at the end of the day, the idea is you observe in silence from a distance.

I ordered a seabass which was served very greasy and disgusting. When I mentioned this to the owner he was very rude and said this was their special sauce and he served many fish and I was the only one to complain! He turned around and walked away! Without even asking me whether I would like my main with anything else (some pasta or a pica). I dis not eat that fish as it was not nice at all! I was left hungry... The evening was ruined and to add some dissatisfaction the pudding was not nice either. We were presented with a bill of over £80 as the set menu for each was around £40. I refused to pay for my main meal as I dis not eat it and wasn’t even oferred a replacement. The owner was furious! He said he was 35 years in this business and I was the first person to say his fish was disgusting. He was rude and very defensive but did take half of the money off the bill. I promised him to relect this all in my review which he reacted to like “whatever”.

Food was the cheapest ingredients imaginable and the cost of even a basic sandwich or milkshake was through the roof. Staff were rude and unhelpful, when we complained about the quality all we were met with was hostility and refusal about our opinions of their food and all they offered was one sandwich off the bill. The chef should be ashamed and possibly not even in the industry at all. I am tempted to call the food standards agency and inform them of the atrocious quality of this place.

Even the napkins were damp and unusable for goodness sake. They claim never to have had complaints but google reviews is full of them and all of them have been given abusive responses by the owners of the cafe.

Do not go to this cafe ever! It is the worst food in a town with plenty of amazing options. If we had not had an insistant child with us we would have left as soon as the plates arrived.

To top off an already poor experience, when we attempted to pay the minimally reduced bill, we were then told there was no card payment available, so started walking to a cashpoint, but felt so nauseated by the time we got there we did not feel enclined to go back and pay, particually as the staff were verging on aggressive with a simple complaint and no apology. About half an hour later in the middle of the town, a car pulled up beside us and a man aproached, he started shouting at us that we had ran out on the bill...he would call the police....put us on facebook etc....all this while we had a child with us. When we tried to explain the situation he was dismissive, rude and aggressive. We walked away for our own safety.

2537,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,6,I’ve just encountered the same issue as the lady below,"Had so many issues on our break it’s been upsetting. And to think my family wanted to join us and go again in the summer holidays. I’ve already told them not to and we won’t be. I’ve stayed at butlins minehead for the past 8 years in a row, this is the first and last trip to Bognor.

After reading someone else just had the same issue I thought I’ll review too. We had some issues before today which were solved at the time (apart from rude staff, handed the right team apparently)
But I’ve just left center stage, we went to watch sleeping beauty and it was very full and we were told by a security man we can sit on the floor, he was nice, I was happy, my 2 kids were happy, we were sat there for 10-15 minutes before a female security guard came up to us and was incredibly rude told us we can’t sit where we were, I asked where am I meant to sit then and she said “no one can sit down due to health and safety. You can stand at the back” she shouted it very rudely and embarrassing in front of so many people. I saw other guests upset by her too.
We looked at the back but nothing can be seen and my toddlers cant stand for that long! I’ve ended up with upset kids who couldn’t see the stage from anywhere so we left before the show even started. I complained to guest services too, just like the woman below, and was fobbed off aswell and told that it’ll be reported to the right team and we can go watch it again at 7:30 tonight. My youngest sleeps by then! Hence why we wanted this show (2pm)
Doesn’t solve it for us does it.. apology would of been nice! Specially when you can tell my daughters got tears in her eyes.

We also queued for over 30 minutes and the queue was right back past the indoor funfair and almost did a whole circle of the skyline. 30 minutes we won’t get back.

After this we have left to go home as this is the 4th time now a member of staff has spoke to us like a piece of dirt.
I don’t care if things are ‘passed on’ to the relevant team... how can this keep happening over and over to so many guests ! Actions speak louder than words. Didn’t solve the tears.

Just thought I would add in that the young bloke who works at the outdoor fun fair on the rides was amazing on our first day. (mid length brown hair and glasses) made my kids super happy when we arrived making the bungee trampoline and helter skelter more fun. Staff like him are a credit to the place and there should be more like him!

2543,Norfolk Arms,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,25,Disappointed,"Unfortunately it’s a lovely central hotel in the little town of Arundel that lacks finesse. The room was suitable for purpose in a back courtyard that was quite and unobtrusive. The most disappointing thing about our stay was the disgusting and virtually inedible breakfast. The cold buffet was mediocre (dried up cheese, ham with dried edges- looked a day old) in comparison to other hotels I’ve stayed in, I asked for a hot chocolate and was told no only tea or coffee, so asked for a flat white and was told no that wasn’t possible so decided on tea which was obviously what they wanted me to have! Anyway let me really tell you about the so say Norfolk Arms Full English breakfast. One shrivelled tomato that was so dried up it was like a rock, a hash brown so deep fried the grease was oozing out, a piece of bacon that was dried up and burnt, inedible scrambled egg that was more like dried shoe leather in a flat thin section, a cold piece of black pudding, cold beans and mushrooms that had the most dreadful flavour of as I’d imagine old socks.. the only good thing was the one tiny little sausage that was probably a local specialty.. I wish I’d just had sausages!! I can honestly say if this place had a decent chef you would not have to go elsewhere, but if you can avoid breakfast do as there are loads of other places in the town that you can eat at!

Yesterday I was sadly disappointed. The lovely big pond next to the reception centre is being ""re-developed"" (I dread to think what that will turn out to be - from the little info given it looks alarmimgly commercial rather than preservational).

On the plus side the reed beds, newly trimmed, looked wonderful in the low winter sunlight and while the new boardwalk surfaces with built-in anti slip are noisier they do look to wear better than the previous chicken-wire solution.

I would like to apologise to the surly girl in the cafe whose kitchen gossip was interrupted by my presence - never mind lass, I paid by card so you didn't have the extra burden of working out change and could quickly return to the kitchen for more chat.

Thank goodness for the reception/shop staff whose friendly service on entry and on exit shone through brightly.

The room was comfortable if a little chilly at first (we don't like it too hot in the bedroom at night so this was fine!).
everyone is very friendly and helpful, live music in the restaurant was ""just right"", not too loud to spoil a conversation but a peaceful background.

2553,Empress Bar,Food,Littlehampton, Pub/Bar,2,Patronising and poor customer service,"My girlfriend and I visited for a drink on our anniversary. Asked for a gin and lemonade and a pint, the drink clearly had no lemonade in and soda was used. We paid £12 for the two drinks.

From the get go we both felt like the older woman behind the bar was very condescending towards us because of our age. Looking at us once we ordered our drinks, she lent over the bar, expecting our IDs rather than asking. Must admit I felt very embarrassed at this point. We took our drinks and sat outside.

After a few sips of her drink, we realised the gin clearly had no lemonade and was completely flat. It tasted of watered down gin. I went and politely told the lady about it and she was very blunt blaming it on the fact we had “waited too long” and the ice would have made it taste like that. Being our anniversary the thought of leaving it and just going to our booked restaurant early instead seemed like a much better option. My girlfriend had to leave the majority of the drink, which clearly meant we weren’t trying to get a free one of what the lady probably assumed.

So from a perspective of working in hospitality too, the fact that there was no option for either a replacement or even offering to fill the glass up with lemonade or even an apology, I thought was appalling. Especially when paying more premium prices for the drinks.

No establishment should be patronising towards anyone or make anyone feel unwelcome. Being clearly the youngest customers should not have any difference on how we are treated. Hence my review.

- far too busy
- supposed smoking places yet people are smoking and vaping everywhere including accommodation
- questionable people staying
- horrible nylon bedsheets

As you enter it's the usual packed holiday resort pool with unisex changing. All seemed well until my partner and daughter went on the 2 big water slides there is available. On their return I took 1 look at my partner and knew all was not well. What's wrong I asked. Pubes all the way up the stairs. So we moved to the rapids. Which clever person thought it was a good idea to make wet people queue in front of an open doorway was clearly from Antarctica. I gave up and left the family to it. On route to the changing room I stopped briefly in the baby pool to get warm to be whistles at by 2 members of staff not 2 feet away from me. Not once but several times both of them. I wouldn't have minded if they weren't in talking distance!!! Ok so I can complain about the reason the only warm pool n the complex was being cleaned as all kids have accidents sometimes. I decided to take myself off to get changed. Stopped off in the loos which were at least a cm deep in other people's wee. Grimaced while I sat on layers of loo roll. Found myself a cubicle to change in BONUS! Went to pop my towel down on the floor to stand on and noticed the floor was dirtier inside the complex than outside and had a nice matting of what I can only assume was all the hair from the opening months customers. Omg get me out of this hell Hole!! It's been open a month the nice young girl politely smiled and told me when I asked show long it had been open.

Starters ? Opted for scallops. We expected, given the £ supplement, to receive 2 maybe 3 King Scallops. We were given what appeared to be 4 Queenie's, just the width of a10p piece max, BUT CUT IN HALF through their girth to a max thickness of 2 £1 coins stacked, presented as 8 pieces,seared side up ????

Mains? I opted for herb crusted cod fillet, again, mean-spirited portion. Tad wider than a fish finger, tasty yes but again tiny .The penultimate negative? Hubby ordered "" Cake "" A Fish Cake of sorts, on a ""Lobster Cream"" and a ""poached egg"" on top,which,as eggs go, had the unyielding stance of a cold squash ball and needed pinning before carving. Given the the slow service, it had been sitting on the pass for too long and is why the lobster cream dissipated.

Final negative? A bill for £100 excluding service with just one small glass of average wine.

Upon complaint..Charlie, a fine ambassador for the BCH simply advised us that our remarks would be forwarded to the chef. By then a tad too late, day already spoilt. Given BCH knew at the time of booking it that it was an important event, I am just so sorry they failed to live up to their own reputation.

Prices very reasonable. Would recommend. Sadly we live too far away to make it a regular visit.",5,2.0,2.0,British,0
2562,Haskins Garden Centre,Food,Littlehampton, Café,4,Afternoon Tea,"This is in relation to the Afternoon Tea for two, not the restaurant or food in general which is great.  When we sat down it was brought straight out, with no preparation, and we quickly realised it wasn't fresh, had been prepared in advance and then stored in a refrigerator. The result was all of it was very cold:  -2 small sub rolls each - dry, hard with no butter and overly chilled filling. -The cake tier had a nice selection, but again really chilled with slightly soggy mini  battenbergs (how they get when they've been exposed to the air a while). -Scones on top, again slightly cold and dry from the fridge. The clotted cream was  like ice cream  That for £12.95 which has gone up this year felt like poor value for money.  I expected good things from Haskins, as mentioned, their restaurant and food is really good and we eat there often. But this felt like they were just on the afternoon tea bandwagon as an easy money-spinner, without any care or attention to the experience which normally people book as a treat.",2,2.0,0.0,British,1
2563,Arundel Castle,Attractions,Arundel,Historical/Culture,87,Amazing Castle,"This was my first castle of our 12 day UK trip where we saw 21 castles. And what a choice to start with! This is the most picturesque castle I could imagine. We did the Gold+ ticket and spent about 3 hours there exploring every area. There is so much history there and so many time periods when things were built. It's incredible to see it all, and the town is charming as well. I would go back every weekend if I lived nearby instead of across the pond. Worth the visit for sure!

2566,Oyster Catcher,Food,Littlehampton, Pub/Bar,45,Dinner out,"So we decided to go to the Oyster Catcher for a spot of dinner, wow what an experience, without a shadow of a doubt the rudest staff I have ever encountered, we got greeted by a woman called Emma, who just looked at me and said, ""Yes"", no pleasantries or welcome, but that's ok, then we ordered food and drinks, and whilst she was ringing it in, I saw a sign on the wall saying bar snax, and then noticed a covered plate, with olives, pistachios and chilli bites, so I lifted the lid and used a cocktail stick to have an olive, BIG MISTAKE.... Emma just looked at me as if I had taken a crap on the bar, and snarled ""you have to pay for those"" so I apologised and said how much do I owe you for an olive, apprantly £2:40 as they can't sell them after I removed one because of a potential allergy problem? I did explain that no prices are marked anywhere, that fell on deaf ears, I ended the conversation with a comment about needing a crystal ball. So I brought a bowl of olives that I didn't want, although the sign on the wall said they come with bread, they don't.
It doesn't end there... When the food came out another Emma, even ruder than the first one, had a go at me for moving tables after ordering food, I did maintain that I hadn't moved tables at all, but it appears it was our fault that someone had moved the table number before we sat down, I have never been spoken to as badly as I was tonight.",1,3.0,0.0,British,1

where was the truffle sauce - no mention on menu it was covered with a massive coating of tomato puree
Cannot fault the staff - just the best we have seen - work hard - friendly
Must say we have been here for the carvery & that is brilliant

2576,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,24,It’s a shame ! ,"It is a pity and a shame for Hilton name! The hotel must be a 2 stars hotel and nothing more . Dirty ( very!!), old and never repaired, neglected, stinky, with the fitting that I have never found in another Hilton hotel.
The room had a lot of missing items ( in a four stars hotel I pretend at least the fridge with at least one water bottle inside), the ceiling was stained, the room was hot even with the open windows and due to this it has been placed an old ventilator and a noisy movable conditioner, with hanging cables everywhere.
The indoor swimming pool had dirty water and floor around it and it hadn’t even the soap in the ( not illuminated) shower.
In the room there were cables and missed switches, one bed lamp was broken and not working.
In the night we were waked up by the fire alarm ( as all the hotel guests) due - they told us - to an alarm in one room ( or by a mis-contact as we suppose). Then at 6 in the morning it was noisily inserted a apology letter under the door, waking us up again.
We have chosen Hilton and not one of the ( many) other hotels because we supposed to have the grant of quality but we were totally wrong. We just paid a 4 star hotel price (270 pound for one night!) to sleep one night in a old, neglected, stinky hotel.

However when it came to paying the bill I was told that today was the day that they couldn’t accept a credit or debit card, and being without any cash was despatched to a cash machine about 5 minutes away.

No apology was offered. Clearly the staff don’t find it necessary to communicate between each other,
