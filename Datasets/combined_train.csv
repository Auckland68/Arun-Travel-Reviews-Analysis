245,Trevali Buest House,Accommodation,Bognor,B&B/Inn,315,Central B & B,"We had room 6, excellent view, we could see the sea from here. There are 8 rooms, the 2 top floor ones are singles. We were told that most of the occupancy was given over to workmen who are digging up part of Butlins to put in a new swimming pool and accomodation. Parking could be a problem, but Alison gave us some permits to sort us out, thankfully. Very good breakfast, but when did hash browns come into an English breakfast? They are just about edible! No bubble and squeak? Black pudding?
Room was very clean, But the shades of green decor was a bit off-putting - lime green armchairs are not my thing!
Not cheap, but very near Butlins and the High Street.

209,Sea View,Accommodation,Littlehampton,Hotel,50,Not what it used to be...,"We lived in the area for 25 years and in fact, my daughter worked at The Seaview bar some years ago when she was a student. We always sent visitors there when our house was full, it was our preferred local hostelry.
So it wasn't surprising we booked a room for 4 nights at The Seaview when we went back last week, and sent them a message through the booking site advising we would be bringing our dog (they are listed as dog friendly on the site).
When booking in, my wife was rather surprised to be told they were not going to accept dogs in future. We were also told the room had no furniture (?) as the dog was staying - we were glad it had 2 beds... - and basically, please pay upfront and don't come back.
The rate included breakfast and I ordered a cooked breakfast and my wife asked for a boiled egg - the lady said: ""We don't do boiled eggs."" so she had toast. When we returned the beds were un-made and the bathroom wasn't cleaned nor towels replaced. The hot water was temperamental - on and off - and an American lady told my wife during breakfast that she had to wash her hair in cold water. She wasn't pleased...
The next day we asked for the bathroom to be cleaned, and it was; but do we need to ask?
We were sorry to see the Seaview like this. We were not made welcome and Beth, the Labrador, and us will not be returning (even if we could)...",2.0,2.0,0,1

Kids loved the Easter animals and egg hunt. But our main reason for changing to a spring break instead of a summer one was the new pool !

Great food, especially breakfast The breakfast is a good generous size and the sausage very tasty. We had the family room, it is spacious and very clean. The room could do with an update though as it’s looking tired. The larger bed was tired and the base was stained but mattress was comfy and bedding fresh. There was a large tear in the quilt cover on the single bed. The window is extremely heavy and bolts to keep it gapped. Needs two people to lift and bolt. The window in the bathroom is right next to the beer garden, so bear this in mind when you are naked from the shower/ bath! Can’t leave open when not in room for security reasons. Bathroom quite mouldy and grout could do with a scrub. However, bathroom was clean and fresh. Both bathroom and bedroom got refreshed everyday.

389,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,3,Charging top prices for low quality food,"Had the buttermilk chicken burger from the pub menu. The chicken steaklets were clearly over cooked. They definitely were not freshly prepared and likely bought in bulk at an Iceland store. Same goes for the french fries. This would be all good and well for the local pub. This is however a Hilton restaurant charging £15 for a low quality burger. My advice would be to go elsewhere, no matter how hungry you might be.

203,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,3,Filthy and Worn Out,"We booked a suite for two nights (having looked at the beautiful photos on the website) and had invited family to have afternoon tea the following afternoon and again for lunch on the Sunday. The hotel looked very impressive as we drove up. Check in was fine - they acknowledged my Hilton Honors membership and gave us some sweets for our son. As soon as we started to go to our room you could see that the carpets were filthy. The stair surrounds were disgusting and looked like they all needed a good scrub with soap and water and the handrails were really sticky. The carpet and upstairs was no better. Stains everywhere and had ripples in it where it had stretched. It literally looked like it hadn’t been vacuumed for a month. The walls were marked and scuffed and the doors looked grubby. The suite was a joke. The carpet was sticky and the room smelt dreadful! A room with a pull out sofa bed that was made up so nowhere to sit, and the facing wall had a massive damp patch and peeling paint. The bedroom was no better, smelt of damp and didn’t look like it had even been hoovered and the bathroom had an old shower over the bath. Hardly the modern facilities shown on the website. We asked for another suite and were told none available until the next evening. The duty manager offered us a family room which was in the same tatty and run down state and was so small you’d be unable to pass someone by the side of the bed. We were then told that there was a new extension - unfortunately full - which presumably is where the photos were taken. We decided we would leave and stated that it was because the place was filthy and the manager said it was because it is in the process of being renovated. Sorry, but that doesn’t give you carte Blanche to offer minging accommodation. Naturally, given the cleaning of the rooms and public areas, we didn’t want to risk the food so cancelled our bookings. Ruined a family weekend that had been planned as a surprise for relatives not seen for five years. Really disappointed in Hilton on this one.

124,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,34,A great weekend,"I’ve been to Bognor Regis twice before and I would say it gets better each time I visit.

There was a bit of a hiccup with our accommodation when we arrived. It seemed housekeepers hadn’t cleaned our apartment. However an alternative was quickly found and they gave us vouchers to apologise for the inconvenience.

We stayed in a Seaside apartment. It was clean, loads of room and came with an oven, microwave and fridge. I had previously stayed in a silver apartment, and to be honest they wasn’t a huge amount of difference between them. The seaside apartment was slightly better furnished and used pastel colours to give it a retro beach feel. My only complaint is that they don’t have anywhere for you to hang your wet towels so you ended up putting them over the doors or outside of the window. A clothes horse would easily solve this. We could hear a bit of noise from the people above us however it was bearable (and you expect to hear noise at such a busy time of year).

The splash pool was fantastic. Yes it does get busy so it’s better to get there when the doors open at 9am or late afternoon. The queue for the flume is too long (we had to wait 30 mins for a two minute ride) but there’s loads of other areas - rapids, wave machine, slides - to keep you occupied.

Entertainment is always top notch with loads of choice. There was a massive queue for Stephen Mulhern and we were worried we wouldn’t get a seat but it all turned out fine.

Some of the facilities are looking a bit tired but you can understand that standards can’t be kept top notch during such a busy period. I don’t think I’ve been anyway in he summer hols where it’s looked perfect.

Premium dining was good with a huge choice of food, with some healthy options available.

There’s so much to do, and I think great value for money. My other half had never been before and was impressed. We will be back!

We stayed four nights and I wish we could have stayed longer. We had a very nice room with a private entrance and a high pitched roof, a cosy bed, a very good shower, enough space to leave the luggage and even a very nice pool area, in a good seize for swimming. We were lucky to have good weather so we could enjoy some sun in a private atmosphere and very well looked after garden and quiet surrounding.

Deborah is a very well trained and experienced host and cook. She takes care of everybody's longings and tries to make your stay unforgettable and comfortable.
Thanks for all the care and the tips we got :-)

The place is very good located, so that it gives you a lot of options to discover the region, their very friendly people, the very good pubs and Inns - especially the Royal Oak Pink Pub down the street (last order 18:30h!!! - but worth a visit).

The breakfast in the main house offers everything you like - everything is fresh and local. Personal wishes are looked after.

We have nothing to complain - you just have to be aware:
1. breakfast ist served until 9:00h - no later. You have to make a breakfast appointment the day before, so it can be prepared freshly and right in time! Try to take it easy - makes your day longer ;-)
2. If you are afraid of dogs, that's the place you get rid of your fear, as the house dog is the friendliest and biggest dog I have ever met :-) - please say hallo from me, if you meet him.

114,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,20,Wedding Anniversary ,"On arrival my husband and I noticed the building looked grubby. We had been a few times previously so could see the differences. The reception couldn’t find our booking so was asked to take a seat. There was cobwebs over the lighting, so first impressions were not good. As we waited more than 40 minutes the room the amount of people complaining was astounding. Keys didn’t work, windows stuck, rooms too hot. One member of staff Esme was bossing the trainee around as she was trying to deal with us, instead of going around the reception desk herself. Also leaning over the desk, as she once again couldn’t be bothered to walk around it so I got an eyeful of her underwear as her dress was so short. Then proceeded to to hum to herself while everyone stood around annoyed.

The room was far from deluxe, basic and in need of some attention. The window wouldn’t stay open as the frame was rotten and there was a window pane missing which was covered up with plastic and cellotape. No air con so the room was scorching. They provided a huge extremely noisy fan which just blew warm air around as the window wouldn’t stay open. Just awful.

The lounge area had several lightbulbs out but was nice to sit in. The garden was lovely for eventing drinks.

The restaurant is our favourite part of this hotel. The food was lovely and the restaurant staff were well trained. Although service was a little slow but as it’s so lovely in the we didn’t mind waiting.

So that will be our final visit to this hotel. As there are our superior to this for the same money.

50,Inglenook,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,48,Disappointed ,"Checked in. Room small but clean. Shower was very good. Room very hot and when you open windows very noisy from traffic outside. There was a fan in the room, this was noisier than the traffic!

Had breakfast there on first
And second morning. Chef took order and was super friendly and funny. Food was really good and freshly made.

On last evening decided to treat Friends to farewell dinner at the Inglenook and book the resturant for 4 adults and 2 children.

Meal was super disappointing. People next to us returned their meal (not sure why) and this should have been a warning! I had also seen a previous meal wending it’s way back to the kitchen.

We’re asked a few times if we were ready to order - finally made choices to be told half of them were not available! Now had to start again!

Ordered scallops starter. Small as expected- over cooked and cold! Also I think my husbands had been halved to make a serve and his were almost undetectable on the plate!

Mains arrive. Friends chicken supreme had less chicken per serve than the kids chicken nuggets! Also didn’t look that nice. The trio of pork was ok but not cracklings on the crackled one! Fish was incredibly small and probably should have been thrown back!

Very disappointed.

We were charged for an extra fish which we had actually cancelled when we saw the size on another table and changed for the supreme - which was equally small.

Final mornings breakfast - different staff member. Bit rude. Took order. Came
Out with plates held in a towel. Ot oh - well bacon had probably been kept warm for quite a while as almost impossible to cut and scrambled egg where previously had been freshly made was mushy and sat in a pool of water-microwaved? A pet hate of mine. Saving 3 minutes of time and the worst thing ever! Fork literally fell through it! YUK! Did not eat and left it all. Service staff did not question why I had ordered a plate of food and left it all!

Would not recommend the food or resturant sadly.

The Sunday roast I did not have but just say it all looked lovely. This was with the first chef I in countered who was very friendly. Polite and funny. Would highly recommend him and not the one who cooked the night of the dinner and the following breakfast! Sadly did not get his name.",3.0,3.0,0,1
36,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,110,Goodbye Bognor,"This is my third consecutive holiday with Butlins, for the last 2 years we’ve stayed at Skegness and we’ve not been disappointed by our stays there.

This year we decided to stay at Bognor Regis instead, we fancied a change of scenery and having previously been to Minehead many years ago it was about time we tried out Bognor so we could compare all three resorts.

Well let me tell you from our personal experience Bognor isn’t the place to be. So where do I begin...

Well checkin was very chaotic. Given rough directions where to drive round to in order to check in and got a bit confused by this. No one around to direct you. When we got to the checkin area it’s a small round room where everyone does the British thing of queuing around the room and out the door. While the process was fairly smooth it was chaotic you couldn’t hear yourself think with so much going on.

3pm it was time to go to our room, on arrival it seemed to be okay but then we realised it wasn’t up to scratch. Hairs in the bathroom sink, shower was dirty, wrappers left behind bedside cabinets, dirt on the floor in the bedrooms. Not impressed. Back to the checkin desk where the lovely lady there I think called Tracie who was great arranged for housekeeping to come back. Literally 15 minutes later a lovely cleaner arrived and was shocked at the state of the rooms. She did an amazing job and the accommodation was spotless. However as we used the accommodation we noticed more problems. Bulbs out in various rooms, bathroom extractor fan not working etc. Back to checkin and Tracie again got it dealt with.

The next day we took a trip to Splash world. Lots of singing and dancing about how it’s all brand new etc. Bit disappointing from an adults point of view. Lots of rides for kids but only 2 for adults excluding the 1 family ride and no where really to have a proper swim. The wave pool had to be shut twice due to metal bars coming loose and floating into the pool. Considering this is brand new it’s rather shocking. Half the changing rooms where blocked off too and while this is great there is a machine to dry your swim wear only 1 was working so queues for that. Yes I get it’s a family place etc but it’s all catered really for young children and teens. Surly a decent thing would of been to refurbish the old pool and have both?

That same evening there was a major power cut in Bognor and while this isn’t something Butlins can do much about, staff where running around like headless chickens not knowing what to do. You’d think a resort this size would have backup generators to even just supply main lighting to main buildings and accommodation but clearly not. I get it’s not something Butlins can control but communication could of been better. As a result of the power failure our evening meal was a no go but Butlins gave us £30 of vouchers to use on restore which was a nice touch. Thanks to DJ in guest services.

Other niggles, shower in the room is like a trickle of water, maintenance replaced the shower head but no change. Towels are only replaced with clean ones on Wednesdays and Sundays (Unlike Skegness where it’s daily and more are given if asked, though I asked for more it was a struggle). Layout of the whole place is a bit poor so much waking to get to/from accommodation to entertainment etc.

We met a lovely couple at Bognor Regis too who where staying at the Shoreline Hotel. They also had problems with leaking toilet, bulbs out etc and maintenance had to go to their room multiple times so it appears the general maintenance of the camp is very poor.

And where do I start on the entertainment. Reds was closed so only entertainment really was on Centre Stage and it was a bit piss poor really. Elton John, ABBA etc while all great music it’s sung by the same people each night. Just an excuse to save money I guess by using in house singers who can’t give a proper performance. Really poor performance here Butlins.

Best part of the entertainment was the Panto. 10/10 really funny and a great laugh for all the family. Have seen them over the last 3 years and they’ve all been amazing!

Overall it’s not the best out of the 3 sights, personally I think Skegness has the upper hand over all 3 resorts. I’d rather go to Minehead or Skegness in the future. While I’ve booked next years break on resort with the lovely Sarah who i must add was great during our stay helping us with our booking for next year and even our assisting guests during the power failure, my stay won’t be here at Bognor. My stay is booked for Skegness.

Thanks Bognor you’ve been well ummm... not great.

Also for note Bognor town seemed rubbish no decent arcades or shops for rock etc open in October a week before half term! Seemed like a ghost town.

211,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,5,Terrible behaviour drunken,"I booked the 80’s weekend for myself and two grown up daughters. I understood it would be an adult weekend and that there would be drinking loud music dressing up etc which I thought could be a fun and upbeat weekend centred around live music.
Unfortunately the experience was not positive. We arrived on site at 5:30 ish bearing in mind you cannot access your accommodation till 4pm. There were already people so drunk they were unable to stand and vomiting in the toilets.
The first night the behaviour of people on site made us feel intimidated and unsafe. Large groups of drunk men making lewd comments whenever females passed, which if made in the street could result in arrests under sexual intimidation. Noise levels throughout the night were high, which we expected but At 4am the people in the accommodation above ours were kicking the doors banging slamming and vomiting.
Hours and hours of shouting banging and loud music throughout the day and night, I know I may sound like a boring old whatsit but if it was clear when booking then I wouldn’t have booked it.
The Saturday morning we went out to see if there were any of the other activities on offer eg the pottery painting etc only to be informed that they have to close these on the adult weekends as the “ men get in and smash the place up”
It felt unsafe, a lack of security / Butlins staff except at the bars. Check in offices etc closed so no one to talk to I had to ask in the restaurant how we could check out. They confirmed they had heard there were “some rude, difficult characters “in the area we were staying. i’m Not a prude or of a fragile nature. I feel there is not enough information given when booking as to the expectation you should have. They have a behaviour charter but it seems these do not apply on adult weekends.
It may be the case that our experience is not the norm but it was our experience. Unregulated groups of very drunk people spoiling the experience for others.
Again if you just want an 18-30’s experience and your 30-60 this may be just what you’re looking for ( and why not) but if you just want a fun weekend cantered around the music rather than just how much alcohol can be consumed then maybe not.

244,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,16,In need of a make over ,"Having spent a lot of my childhood at the site I was excited to come back as an adult with our family. We booked a kids weekend with my sister, brother in law and child (just under 2), my parents and my parter (I am pregnant).

The accommodation was basic but clean. Couldn’t complain about location or facilities in the room apart from the uncomfortable beds. All members of the party woke up with back ache every morning. Housekeeping were really good, and made shapes out of the towels every day which was fun!

The food in the deck was good with a lot of variety. Only comment would be that the one night I had pasta from the pasta station the guy was too busy talking he forgot to actually cook the pasta and only realised once the sauce was ready so I had to wait double the time for the meal.

The resort itself is perfect for kids, however it is looking tired and in desperate need of refurb. Feels like there’s too much accommodation and not enough activity for the masses. All good and well spending money on new additions (the pool) but what about maintaining the facilities you already have?

Also barely saw any red coats during the trip. Isn’t that what Butlin’s is known for?!

Haven’t decided if I would go back.

21,Swan Hotel,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,172,Short changed in the bar,"Visited this pub on a say trip to Arundel with my retired and disabled brother. He bought the food and drinks and paid cash. We got to our table and had kept saying to me that something wasn't right. I saw her handed over two 20 s and he showed me the change that was €7 we'd bought 2 drinks and some squid. Seemed rather overpriced so I checked the menu and he's been short changed by a massive £10. I went back to the bar to poinr this out and the barman wad totally non plussed like this was meaningless. I was very concerned. Yes he gave us our £10 but no apology and no reparation. It's a big mistake to make.
I think most people wouldn't even realise. Made me wonder if it's a common ploy there or if they are so used to cards the staff don't take much notice of notes and don't even look at the denomination.

Very worrying...check your change carefully if you go there.
We went in this pub because it's a Fullers and does food assuming they have standards.

What a shame.

157,Premier Inn Littlehampton,Accommodation,Littlehampton,Hotel,26,Worst Premier Inn I have ever stayed at,"Absolutely AWFUL. Check In was fine, but I got put in a room in the ""New"" block which meant a walk outside a 0 degrees celcius :-( When I got to the ""New"" block, the front door was swinging in the wind, which meant the enterance and corridors were also very cold. My room was cold (until I found the Aircon control). Having set the aircon to 21 Celcius I'm then confronted with a system that's noisy (sounds like a jet plane cruising). Then when I went for a meal at the attached pub/restaurant that was dire (I left Hungry) and because of this experience I cancelled my Breakfast at reception. Finally (and to me the last straw - hence this poor review) when I went to order pizza from a.n.other I needed a postcode, only the Post Code on the website was advertised as BN16 1AF, when infact it's actually BN16 1EB. Complete disgrace. WORST Premier Inn I have ever stayed in (and believe me I've done quite a few). Recommend - certainly NOT.

26,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,34,Cracking weekend,"Having resisted my wife’s efforts to visit Butlins for several years,, I arranged a visit with a 20 person group of friends to visit BR for her surprise 40th birthday celebration.

We had a fantastic time, the room in the Ocean hotel was fine there than the heat (Rooms are so hot) the amenities are all you need and the shows were fantastic, we visited for the adult only Bootleg ball and for sure we will be back, highly recommended.

If I could offer one suggestion to Butlins apart from the heat of the rooms already covered above would be that 09:00 for breakfast starting is a bit on the late side for the early risers and a view that was shared amongst several guests

369,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,18,Disappointing half term break,"We booked a Gold apartment for 3 adults & 2 children February half term and were very disappointed: The accommodation smelt stale and was not clean when we moved in with a thick layer of dust on the dishwasher, rubbish down the back of the sofas, dirt, elastic bands and clips behind the bedroom drawers and stained bedroom curtains. We had only 1 dishwasher tablet left for the whole week and dirty wet towels we left on the floor were folded for us to reuse. We asked Guest Services what we might expect from daily housekeeping which we had paid for and were told only beds were made & bins emptied unless we requested otherwise. This is hardly daily housekeeping and we never saw the housekeeper to ask for more cleaning. Reception staff were apathetic to our complaints and so we bought some cleaning materials ourselves to get the job done. We could only access the cutlery drawer by opening the fridge door first (bizarre) and the fridge had door struts missing so the milk fell out every time it was opened! Entertainment and site facilities were generally good so it’s a great pity that the accommodation was such a let down. We filled in a satisfaction questionnaire and requested feedback but have received no response to date -again disappointing.

Towels provided, toiletries and tea tray and fridge in room. Microwave on each floor by lift great for warming kids foods.

TV basic freeview channels one in main bedroom and other in kids room with beds.

Positives: spacious room, daily room service, iron and ironing board, food package excellent includes fruit juices and hot drinks

Negative: stains on decorative cushions bed runner and sofa, no sockets by bedside table, bed side lamp dim, restaurant crowded often queues, check out too early 10am.Very small lobby area. Bed sheets not changed for whole of stay, towels alternate days. Not enough variety in tea tray e.g. herbal tea and no biscuits.

Salmon was cooked and ok but was on a huge bed of spinach with some new potatoes - which I had requested no potatoes - my husband asked for new potatoes and got chips. That’s it!!! No other veg or salad. We had used a spirit fm voucher to pay for meal but still not worth that! We will not be going back. I think that was the worst evening and meal out for a long time.

All 4 steaks were cooked to perfection, so much so that we asked to speak to the chef, Kelly, to congratulate her on doing such a brilliant job. We guys know our steaks and we had to say this was one of the best steak experiences we'd had in a long time. Outstanding !! The waiter, Tony (from Liverpool I think), was very very good and really helped to make the evening a very pleasant experience. Would highly recommend this restaurant.

The changing rooms were grim , not clean and pubic hairs all over the floor, it was gross, we overheard a family saying lets get out of here its hell. It was hell, i wish you had kept the old pool open. We wont be coming here for swimming again, the pool is great if you are a toddler or early teens, nothing for adults here, not even a bar or food by the pool, avoid this place if you can. I read other peoples reviews on here before going and thought people were being picky however i agree with them.I also think you should think about doing more entertainment for adults during the day, couples come here not just families and i think it would be nice have a mix of adults and kids stuff. I am also shocked the on site fish and chip shop is closed on a Sunday and Monday yet the takeaway part is open, that should be changed, the whole site should be open not half, you pay enough on a day pass and even to stay there you pay enough I am so shocked at the new pool.

198,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,588,The accommodation cleanliness is not even 1 star.,"What a dump. It’s good to see the Butlin's managing director stepping down. The accommodation is atrocious; I don’t expect 5 star accommodation but do expect cleanliness. These silver rooms need demolishing and re-building to a standard which is at least habitable. I walked into a room that had dirty plates in the shower cubical, filthy carpet, the dressing table top had coffee spilt on it, the main table was sticky with some other substance the basin was cracked and looked like it had never been cleaned, mould and dirt with cobwebs everywhere. The towel rails are hanging off the walls, to add to the list we can have wood lice all over the place inside and out, and locks on the doors that anyone can open with a long thin screwdriver, due to a purpose drilled hole next to the lock, see pictures. Let’s hope the new director does the right thing. These rooms are the only thing that let Bognor down, absolute filth.

345,Bailiffs Court,Accommodation,Littlehampton,Hotel,14,Perfect medieval setting for a romantic weekend away ,"Easy to reach and a total escape from the buzz of London, Baillifscourt hotel is a medieval beauty.

Hotel staff were all so friendly and made us feel immediately welcome, it was like being at a home away from home.

We stayed in the original climping room which was full of character, old beams, leased light windows and a fully stocked fireplace ready for a blaze! The bathroom had been recently refurbished by the looks of things - it was really spacious with a powerful shower and huge bath. Of course the Temple Spa toiletries were a good addition too, allowing you to have your own spa time in your bathroom.

Drinks in one of the lounges by a blazing fire pre-dinner was a great start to the evening. Our waiter Charlie was lovely and very attentive. The dinner setting was beautiful in the wood panelled restaurant with candlelit tables.

The food was really outstanding. Scallops to start, chateaubriand for main and soufflé for dessert. Couldn’t fault any of them. our mains did take a while to come out but then again it’s nice to relax and spend as long as you want at the dinner table.

Used the spa both days and found it to be a good place to relax. The outside pool is definitely my favourite, it was well heated and I could have spent all day in there. They have set times for children to use the pools so you can work around them if you want. I had the 25 minute back, neck and shoulders massage which was very good albeit a bit too expensive for the length it was.

This was all followed by a walk along the beach which is a short stroll from your room.

Couldn’t recommend this place more and we will definitely be returning.

We stayed at the shoreline Hotel which was in our experience not bad at all. The room was clean on arrival, everything was replenished etc... The room decor was good as it's children based boat themed with their own little room with bunk beds. The main double bed was comfortable & didn't wake up with any aches or pains lol. The main gripe is the air conditioning unit as it only allows you too turn it down to 19c max, would of like it too go lower & blow out of the fan system alot more powerful as we were all very hot in the room during the evening. Been here in July but stayed at another hotel on the complex... Entertainment was good for the children, just that the food & drinks are so over priced but I guess that's how they make their money!

Yes and? We paid a £6 tray fee to have it bought up! The hotel did remove the tray charge from our bill but our experience was ruined by then, all this this for £170 for one night, too basic and not enough facilities for that price!

From the moment we arrived until the moment we left we were very well cared for. The reception team were warm and friendly and went out of their way to help us settle in. They had recommended a particular room to suit our requirements and it was lovely and suited us perfectly. Bailiffscourt is in a beautiful setting, very peaceful, and we were able to totally relax, after a hectic few days, which was the aim of our stay. The food was wonderful: inventive (but not wacky!) and delicious and a feast for the eyes too. But it’s the little things that make the difference in a top class place like Bailiffscourt: the manager stopping to chat to see if you’re enjoying yourselves, the genuine caring kindness (rather than someone just following customer service rules) of staff like Arthur who served us in the lounge, the gorgeous and plentiful spa products in the bathroom. It’s fair to say that it’s expensive to stay there, so, for us, although we’d love to go back, we will have to wait for another special occasion. However, the whole visit felt like a wonderful treat from start to finish and I can’t recommend it highly enough.

A couple of suggestions would be to boost the wi-if as it was patchy at times, and as the football is so popular maybe an organised game at a certain time every day on the pitch would be a good idea?

Before we arrived I didn’t have particularly high expectations due to a disappointing tots break a few years ago. This time it couldn’t have been different!

We stayed in the shoreline hotel which was well located for all the attractions. Upon arrival the guys welcoming us on site were really friendly and welcoming- although finding a parking spot was difficult even at 3pm. The queue to check in was long and slow moving but as we arrived at the same time as everyone else was so surprise. Our room was fine very clean and the kids loved the bunk beds and activity bits on the wall.

We opted for the dine around package where you can go to the waitress served restaurants and includes a glass of wine/beer with your meal. The pub and fish and chip restaurants were really good the staff went out of their way to accommodate us with two tired and fussy kids, the dinner was ok but the food was average and service very slow.

The new pool is brilliant both kids loved the slides and rapids although one afternoon it was so crowded it was starting to feel unsafe.

The funfair was a huge hit and nice that it’s fully included so no need to say no to the hundredth go on the helter skelter!

All of the staff we met were so friendly and welcoming my kids loved the attention and all the high fives!

I don’t know why the Fire Alarms keep going off, but I always get told by reception when I have a moan “that someone smoked in the room or a shower set it off”. Last night was the same & is probably the final straw for me in terms of staying at the Norfolk Arms.

I’ve never had any offer of compensation on the numerous occasions it has happened & the bigger concern for me now, is that I take it for granted that it’s not an actual fire, I don’t even get out of bed for these alarms. so one day a fire may actually occur and any frequent stayers will probably just ignore it.

Great shame because if it wasn’t for this I’d easily give it a 4 out of 5.

57,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,25,"Nice break, shame about the accommodation...","We booked our 3 night stay from 27-30 December as a post-Christmas treat for the family (2 adults, 2 kids, 4 and 5.5 years old).

We’d never been to Butlins before so weren’t really sure what to expect and had read reviews which were either really good or terrible, so just decided to book and make up our own minds – plus it was cheaper at this time of year than our usual choices of either Haven or Centreparcs.

First impressions weren’t good –we arrived and parked in the car park to discover that our ‘apartment’ was the furthest distance away of all the accommodation. Bearing in mind that people in the apartments are obviously self-catering, and will therefore have a ton of stuff to haul to the room, you’d think they’d make some parking available nearer that part of the resort (or at least some temporary parking so you can offload nearer to your room). So, we had to do 2 trips back and forth from one side of the resort to the other, balancing our stuff on the airport-style trollies which had been left scattered around the car park. Not the most relaxing start to the weekend.

The ‘standard apartment’ should maybe get a name change to ‘basic apartment’ as that would more accurately describe it. We made our way to the apartment, located in what I can only describe as rows of very dated apartment buildings, almost prison-like in their style, complete with paint peeling off the outer walls, doors etc. Having got past the other apartments and their new owners for the weekend, most of whom were busily smoking away in the doorways (there are designated smoking areas on the site but these were mostly ignored going by what we saw over the 3 days we were there). We got into the ‘apartment’ (which is pushing it really – ‘bedsit’ might be a better description) and were hit immediately by the smell of tobacco smoke and, in the kids room, the unmistakable smell of weed. The grill in the cooker was partly broken and was hanging down into the oven and there was mildew/mould on the crumbling window sills. No towels were provided (although we already knew this, but it’s still a basic thing that’s provided in most resorts these days). A complaint was made and the grill was eventually fixed although it was only my wife’s decision to bring a scented candle with us that helped with the smell of the place.

The apartment itself is basic, with the usual things you need (plates, cups, cutlery, tea/coffee, toaster etc.), although a cheese grater might have been useful (a minor gripe but still would’ve been good). The floor throughout the apartment was uneven and ‘bumpy’, illustrated by the fact that we put a toy car on the table between the kids’ beds and it rolled all the way off it in 2 seconds. Yes, these buildings really ARE old!

Anyway, from here on things get better, so we just used the apartment as a place to spend as little time as possible and got out and about instead. There are loads of things to do on the resort, with all sorts of entertainment available for the kids throughout the day (arcades, shows, character meets/photo opportunities, playgrounds, outdoor funfair (free), go karts (£6 per car), zipwire etc.) plus the beach (pebbles, no sand) is right outside, to the rear of the site.

The evening entertainment was very good, with the Redcoats’ enthusiasm unwavering – the kids were engaged and entertained on all 3 nights, with their favourite being the animal show on the last night, which was very good and they enjoyed the disco part of the evening too. However, the queues to get in (and therefore to bag the best seats/tables in whichever venue you’re going to in the evening) start early and the die-hards get themselves in the queue about 30 mins or more before doors open at 7pm. If you’re not one of them, you’ll have to be happy with a seat at the back of the big room.

The absolute highlight of the weekend, however, was the swimming pool, including the spacious changing area. You can tell where all the money has been spent lately (god knows it’s not the apartments), as the swimming pool is fantastic. Having two under 6’s, the tallest of which is about 115cm, there was only one slide of the 5 or 6 available that they couldn’t go on (the height limit on the biggest slide is 120cm with a minimum age restriction of 8), which was a very welcome surprise. The slides, including the ‘rapids’ which take you outside (albeit undercover) and then back in were a real hit with our kids – one can swim, the other still needs a buoyancy vest – and they said that was their favourite of the slides. My only note on this would be that on the 2nd day we went in (at the same time of day as the first, around 3.30pm), it was way too busy and the wave pool seemed dangerously overcrowded. However, for all the complaints about other aspects of the resort, I have to be fair here and admit they’ve absolutely nailed this part.

We didn’t try any of the dining out places as we just cooked for ourselves, but the range and number of places available seems to be very good, although the on-site supermarket was very low on things when we went and the prices are a bit steep (they obviously assume you won’t be bothered to go elsewhere) - you’re better off going out to the huge Sainsbury’s a couple of minutes down the road.

So, overall it was a good break based on the fact that the kids had a good time (and as all parents will know, if the kids are happy it makes the holiday so much better). Basically, the accommodation is, at absolute best, basic and just about tolerable. It’s the entertainment and activities which make it (and which made this a 4 star review rather than 3). If they spend some serious money on repairing/updating the apartments and making them and that part of the resort more attractive/liveable, it would make the place so much better.

Met at the reception/bar by staff member who was reasonably freindly, producing the booked bill to sign on arrival. No introduction of her name however.

Other staff were reasonably pleasant, but not overly friendly, and again not a mention of a name.
Breakfast was cooked quickly, with a reasonable selection of choices. No frills but filled a hole.

Bed linen was straight out of the 80's, and a bit holey/threadbare in places. Bed was useable but not the most comfy.

Overall the room was a bit grubby in the slightly less obvious places, and again just felt unloved.

Bathroom was fuctional, the shower worked but had seen better days, showerhead quite heavily scaled and worn.

Towels provided are rediculously small.

315,Swan Hotel,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,63,"Unfortunately, not a ‘LUXURY’ Stay!!!","We stayed here on Halloween as it was our 1 year Wedding Anniversary. I had requested through booking.com for the hotel to do ‘anything they could to make our stay extra special’ with it being our anniversary. This was confirmed back that the hotel would do this. I had no idea or thought as to what that would actually be, but anything to add a special touch would have been lovely. This did not happen which was really disappointing as it was confirmed they would do something. We Got into our room and I have to say, for £124 and the ‘LUXURY’ room, I was very underwhelmed! We needed an iron so rang down for one, the lad said he’d be straight up. Approx an hour later, I rang again and he’d forgotten as it was very busy at the bar and he was on his own. 5 minutes later, he brought the iron. Whilst waiting for the iron, I had a shower in what should have been a flawless bathroom but there was mould around door edges, the shower and the middle of the ceiling. Again, not what you’d expect for a ‘luxury’ room. We went out for tea through the night exit / entrance and found it left on the latch which is a security concern, I took it off to make sure it was closed properly. Got back to the room and I tried to watch the Telly but it was wonky, I tried to straighten it but realised the bracket itself was wonky so I left it!! The lighting in the room at night is quite dark and my wife found it very hard to do her makeup, resorting to using her phone torch!!
The next morning I put the cases on the car and again, the night entrance was on the latch so anyone could walk in off the street! I went to breakfast and picked up my side plate to get a croissant, I thought the plate was stained as I could see a yellow tint on it and then realised it was actually a Dirty plate!!!!! The breakfast was very good and they catered for my specific requests, it was just very disappointing that we kept finding issues. I wanted to make sure I told the hotel about our experience and did at the bar. The person I spoke to did not fill me the confidence that she would pass on my concerns so I emailed the Hotel. I have accepted a refund for my stay, which is fine......I just wish they’d got it right on the night though!!! I have given the hotel a 2 star as we did not experience ‘LUXURY’ and I was told I would be contacted Monday morning for the refund and I actually had to ring up around 6pm to sort it!!!
If in Arundel again, I’ll try somewhere else instead.

18,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,105,Way better than expected!,"Before visiting Butlins, I had very low expectations due to its reputation and the fact the breaks are quite low cost... however the whole experience of the Tots Week was amazing! The Wave Hotel was excellent, the food and buffet selection was excellent, the ""all inclusive "" entertainment was excellent. I cannot rate this break highly enough, especially if you can book into some of the nicer accommodation.

The only gripe I have is the leniency of staff with regards to people reserving spaces in the theatre. Whilst there are announcements that ask people not to do it, the floating staff can visibly see people holding seats and yet say nothing. Other than this point, the staff were amazing and helpful.

If you haven't been, and are considering going for a Tots Week, i would definitely urge you to book as you'll have a fab time.

12,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,69,Horrendous noise Oyster Bay,"In Oyster Bay. Oh dear.

Very poor sound insulation and very noisy guests.

From 11.30pm to 1.30am adults shouting, swearing, kids screaming. While we expected some noise, the amount of noisy adults, kids, TVs and lack of sound insulation is just horrendous.

You can hear neighbours TV and conversation very clearly up until 1.15am and again when they are up at 7am. The other neighbour played drum and bass until 1am. The effect of security coming is only temporary. We can hear our neighbours in all of our rooms (two bedrooms and bathroom).

Impossible to get decent sleep or even sleep in.

Oyster bay consists of very long rows of run-down flats with very large ""fish bowl""window. You""ll need to keep the curtains closed though as multiple other residents walk right past the windows. The upper walkways aren't level and there are many cracks, it doesn't look or feel safe. The flats opposite are really close adding to noise issues.

All-in all,the noisy accommodation and lack of sleep is ruining the holiday.

Think very carefully before booking Oyster Bay.

We tried moving but site full. Considering leaving but paid £600 for 3 nights.

Butlins should show photos of the outside of these flats. We would never have gone.

The bar downstairs was well stocked and we were served by a friendly lady who then took us through to the dining room.
There was a large party in the conservatory so we were in the main dining area. It was very pleasant, the food was very good as was the buffet breakfast the following morning. The breakfast offering was continental or you could have cooked food to order.

Our bedroom was spacious and clean with an amazing view of the resort fun fair and sea. We had housekeeping everyday and the housekeepers done a brilliant job of turning our room around and leaving fresh towels (also making fun animals out of the towels which my boys loved) refreshing tea and coffee they done great! Breakfast in the hotel was delicious with plenty of choice for our family of 5, we also had character breakfast in Papa Johns on 2 occasions which was equally as good. The Butlers Spencer and Stephen were fantastic always on hand to help us with everything that we needed and were always more than happy to help and give advice to make the most out of our holiday. This resort has so much to offer the funfair provided hours of fun for our family across the week and there was always plenty of activities and shows available to go to , we were never bored. The pool is fantastic with great slides. Both the Red Coats and Skyline gang were amazing , very energetic and our boys were always entertained when watching them, they all do an amazing job and genuinely look happy to be there. The soft play area is large with plenty to do and my sons enjoyed hours of fun in there. We ate out every night our favourite 2 restaurants were Papa Johns and Traditional Fish and Chips Restaurant , both of these restaurants are a credit to this site . The staff in both provided exceptional customer service , always had a smile on their faces and interacted with us. The food in both was delicious we were never disappointed , so thank you to all the staff you made our holiday that extra bit more special.

40,Village House,Accommodation,Arundel,B&B/Inn,14,Clean,"We'd booked this as a last minute stop over so we could see our daughter in Brighton before we headed to Gatwick. TripAdvisor reviews and photos looked good.

On arrival we found a pleasant if a little tired, village pub. Staff were friendly.

We were shown to our room and found it was extremely basic and had a shared bathroom. We thought we'd booked ensuite (but that could have been our error so would be unfair to apportion blame). We asked about changing rooms and we're told that no one else was booked in to share the bathroom - possibly reluctant to change us because it would mean preparing another room (I don't know). We were too tired to push it so we agreed but this did mean that our route to the loo and shower was across the stairs from the bar and dining room.

The food and drinks were good. Usual pub menu and range but was hot and nicely presented.

On retiring for the night, the pub was closed and dark around 10.30/11 so our moonlight flits to the loo weren't as stressful as anticipated.

The shower sounded like it was powered by a combine harvester and the shower screen door was propped up outside the bathroom having been replaced by a shower curtain. The shower holder was broken so we couldn't change the angle of the water so the floor and bathmat were cold and soggy by the time we'd showered.

I can't comment on the standard of the other rooms but our room most certainly wasn't 4 star and I'd be reluctant to return. I do have to acknowledge the age of the building and that updating it would be tricky, but keeping what they do have, in better order would make a nicer stay

- apartments are very basic, stayed in the ""new style silver"" yet it had a very musty smell to it

118,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,49,Not my best experience in a branded hotel,"I booked two rooms, 1 double and 1 twin for 3 nights. In my opinion the rate I took from the call centre after struggling for 3 days on the web, was over charged, especially as the first price quoted before I complained bitterly, was £1,116. I explained as the web page was not working the rate went up from £732 to what I got eventually which was £876. I did complain but was told it was due to availabeilty, which was odd, as the follow days when I got the web page to work, it was cheaper, but the $876 brought me a no cancelation clause. Then came the hotel experience, the twin room had to be changed after checking in, my in laws notice sewage in the bath tub, this was I am told due to a blockage. There were no engineers on the weekend, but the room was eventually changed after being told there were no twin rooms left. Perhaps a misunderstanding, meaning on the ground floor. The doubke room was extremely small, perhpas smaller than advertised and looking a little ""sad"" and well used. The safe battaey needed changing, but after reminding the reception staff, 3 days later it still had not been changed. The staff are very young and in desperate need of training, they never smile, say hello or ask how things are going. There were exceptions of course, but rare. The breakfast had a good variety and was well presented, with additional items for purchase. The hotel location is also very nice. Please note it seems to be a wedding hotel, so Friday and Saturday nights are extremely loud with more than you fair share of people with a little more to drink than normal perhaps.

15,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,7,Mixed Feelings on Butlins,"We spent a four night break. First the good points, we are exhausted on our return! The days were busy, booked a few activities, splash pool was great, we went everyday. Funfair good, evening shows, circus good. Would recommend going early to the pool as it gets extremely packed and queues for rides can be 50 mins wait. Also the changing room gets very dirty after 11am!

Bad points, cleanliness of apartment awful. Kitchen cupboards dirty, utensils had food on them probably from last guests, kitchen floor sticky, dustpan and broom filthy with dirt and hair. I had to buy my own at local supermarket. Bathroom radiators so dusty, had to wipe down before putting our towels on them. Kids would not sit on the carpet after seeing dirt underneath sofa, no furniture moved for hoovering. It was a new style silver, but though it looked modern, look closer and things have not been maintained or cleaned so have built up dirt. Bring your own pots, pans,
and cutlery ones provided were old and beaten up. Considering we were a family of five, they only gave us cutlery for four.
The entertainment venues also need a good cleaning, floors were sticky and ventilation was awful, no air, horrible stale smell in Centre Stage and Reds venue. They need to clean in between shows, if you go to a later show you have to sit amongst, rubbish, spilt drinks, sticky floors from previous show. The arcades are a waste of money, kids go crazy trying to get as many tickets as possible, you will trade them in for rubbish. Will not be going back to Butlins, definitely not Bognor. Maybe the cleaning in the hotel rooms might be better, but cleaning should be to a certain standard in all accomodation, no matter what level.

308,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,29,awful accommodation,"We booked the Seaside apartment this time having been to another part of the site a year and a half before. My grandson is 3 (one and a half last time) and my daughter thought The Seaside apartments sounded nice - don't be fooled like we were.We went in October half term as my other daughter and grandaughter have a different half term to other areas of the country. When we arrived at the apartment we started to unpack the few groceries we had brought with us - I felt quite queasy as the dining table started to move (unstable). everywhere felt sticky and the veneer (if you can call it that) had started to peel off. My grandson's white socks soon became very dirty and slipper bottoms were tacky. We could hardly get into the bathroom (you almost had to get into the shower to get through the door) and we had to call out maintenance twice as the contents of the toilet and sink would not empty and started to fill up. The outside drains had to be rodded. Our front door would not shut properly on a couple of occasions and the windows of the rooms were very poor - condensation and we could not leave the window on the catch to ventilate and the lounge window hinge was buckled. Our friends also had a similar appartment and they left a day early (there were 3 in their group but 6 in ours). We did have a power cut which took out most of the surrounding area and I have to say the staff in the fish restaurant were a delight and kept reasuring us (fortunately we ordered before the power went off so we got our meal). I have already been in touch with a higher authority to complain but I felt I was being patronised and it was if the lady who responded was pacifing me with answers off a script. There was no offer of compensation only that if we were to go again they could offer a discount (we could probably get that by booking on line anyway). It has totally put me off Butlins and sad to say that my 3 year old grandson will probably miss out on family visits like this in the future - there must be other wonderful sites out there.

Terrible Management and no apparent care for safety of those on resort. Waste of time complaining as you will receive what seems like a template email!

Considering the type of weekend this was I was shocked at the lack of security (no bag searches etc). Perhaps they should invest more money into security as after being attacked and no security arrived to remove the 2 people attacking me for a good 3/4 minutes I am informed that there is no CCTV!!!!!!!!!!!

The policies at this resort are not followed!!!!!! Avoid at all costs! Cheap for a reason

Beware,"On arrival we - 2 adults with our 2-year-old baby were stopped in front of their entrance stating a child is not allowed. Although booking was done via Hotels.com, Lady came up with a paper stating our booking through Expedia is for 2 adults only. Hotels.com had no answer as to why owner had Expedia reference and said they can’t help as child wasn’t mentioned while booking.
Room information on hotels.com stated room accommodates 2 adults and child if child shares bed with parents. B&B’s website states children are welcome. Despite of this they said children are not allowed and closed the door.
Our fault that we did not confirm baby while booking. The thought of this being a problem never came into our mind as baby co-sleeps with us occasionally and we booked a king size bed for that night. We told hotels.com about the treatment that we got there and we had no intention to stay with such uncourteous Owners. Finally, after a struggle of an hour, we arranged alternative accommodation via google. Before moving we just knocked on their door to show their own website policy, to which one of the owners said, ok then a child and mum can stay in the room and also tried to make fun in a sarcastic way. We understood they are after making money without letting us in, hence we left to the next hotel by cursing their rude behaviour.

215,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,176,Toddlers week - really quite brilliant ,"Arrival was smooth, drove straight up in the car at 1pm. No queue. We were shown where to park. In silver accommodation so made our way to their desk, told access to our rooms was 4pm, then given wrist bands and keys (the electronic card types) then were free to use the facilities: soft play/indoor/outdoor fairground. I went off to the big Tesco’s (7 mins drive away and they do click and collect!) to get our weekly shop.

They have trolleys (like airport trolleys) to help unpack the cars.

Our accommodation was nice: clean, tidy, basic, but comfortable. We were very lucky with the weather, it was very warm but I’m guessing in the apartment would not be warm without the sun on it all day. In fact, ours felt a little damp in bed at night! They have little electric heaters in the room but I’m not sure how helpful they would be?

The kitchen is VERY basic. Kettle, microwave, oven. Take tea towels!!! Even if they give you one, it’s flimsy and won’t help with drying up a whole families washing up every day for 4 days! As we were in silver accommodation we had no towels so took our own (forgot a hand towel for the bathroom though 🙄) didn’t even think to take soap for the bathroom!

The wardrobes are TINY no way I could have hung much up even for the kids (even if I had remembered to bring hangers).

Dinner at the Diner - poor service and they weren’t even that busy! Expensive food and distinctly average. Very disappointing.

Our ‘keys’ regularly stopped working and we had to keep walking back to guest services - really annoying! Even had to have maintenance come out to check the door for us!

Swimming pool was epic. So much fun. Such a shame that it isn’t open for more hours really.

Fair ground rides are traditional and the kids (4 and 1) loved them. Basically no queues for anything so was perfect for them really.

Shows were great. Didn’t bother with fast track passes and still had decent seats for the shows. Queues for photos with characters were quite long (and ultimately the packages for the photos aren’t cheap), but u can take your own photos.

Beach is a very short walk away (just outside the back gate). It’s pebbles though.

Check out by 10am but you can stay and use the facilities again.

If anything says how good our week was, we booked to go back in August! Even though it was 3 times more expensive and its school holidays! We got a fairly decent discount for booking before we left!

If you want a nice family holiday, don’t book here, you won’t get any sleep whatsoever, full of chavs and pond life.

I did plan to review the new pool, which in my personal opinion is very dangerous, and the poor quality of the hotel room, with its cobwebs and peeling paint, but I seriously haven’t got the interest or energy, butlins has just gone down hugely in my expectations, avoid avoid avoid.

342,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,1,Be careful when ordering the Premium dining plan - you don't get what is advertised on the Butlins website,"My family and I saved up for a few days in Butlins last December and as a treat paid for the Premium dining plan. What is advertised on their website isn't what we got. They advertise a carvery, live cooking stations and theme nights including Tex-Mex, Italian, Indian and Chinese. We saw none of these and on phoning Butlins we were initially told that due to an overspill we were given Food Court dining by mistake. On complaining we were then told we were miss-advised and we did get Premium dining even though we didn't even get a sniff of any of the above. You will also waste your time with the complaints department as they need a complaints department to deal with the complaints about their complaints department. If they have done this to us then how many other families have not got what they paid for? A totally shocking experience from what is supposed to be a family based company.
I am now having to go through the legal route due to the false advertising on their website and am building a case against them through social media as they just don't care. They also said they could not log this as a complaint as this was not done within the 28 days after our stay even though we have just recently found out that we didn't get the Premium dining as first thought - this is a very sneaky way of keeping their complaints stats down.

The actual pool and rides is very nice, bit of a wait for some of the slides but what can you expect on a bank holiday weekend. What I did take a big exception to was the disgusting state of the changing rooms. There was blood smeared across the walls together with god only knows what else. The floor was filthy strewn with rubbish and hair. Bultins really need to get their act together and get cleaners cleaning more regularly.
Outside the fair rides are looking a little dated and one several were not working.

It took me 3 phones calls to sort this out and also promise of a call back which never happened. Not all but the reception staff I dealt with I found a bit rude. The rooms our outdated and tired.

162,Ocean Hotel & Spa,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,11,Disgustingly dirty rooms!!,"We visited for a family break in July with 2 young children. As Butlins prides itself on catering for family’s especially with its ‘tots breaks’ we expected the accommodation to be clean. On arrival in our room we noticed hair in the toilet, hair in the bath, carpet looked like it hadn’t been touched with a Hoover, thick dust on the phone and tv (clearly not been cleaned for ages) you could leave finger prints in the dust!! filth all over the coffee tray and filth in the fridge, dust and grime around the edges of the floor and sliding door, some disgusting bit of muck on the sink! we have never complained before to a hotel but the standard was poor and made us feel dirty just looking at it! The manager was very good and moved us to the service recovery room. This at first glance appeared a lot better. Then in the children’s room there was thick dust on the windowsill, the remote for the children’s tv had the batteries held in by 2 plasters which is ridiculous!! ..a hair clip, 1p piece and small bouncy ball had all be overlooked when cleaned and my one year old grabbed 2 of these items off the floor!
The lifts are crazy, you stand there for ages and when one does arrive you can’t fit in. When I put in a letter of complaint I was told the lifts are fit for the amount of guests but I wonder if they have actually considered how many of their guests have young children in buggy’s! In my opinion and many of the people we talked to in the que It would seem not! When I wrote a letter of complaint they took little responsibility for the state of the rooms and stated that they had a ‘resolve on site policy’, having already wasted time moving from the filthy room to the ‘service recovery room’ which was still dirty I would wonder why they would think I would bother complaining more on site. Surely the service recovery room is as good as it gets!

132,Norfolk Arms,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,21,Possibly my worst roast dinner..?,"It was Easter Sunday around 3pm and we were hungry. We saw the Norfolk Arms was advertising roast dinners and, although it was fairly expensive, decided to give it a try. I went to the Norfolk Tap bar to order two roast beef dinners and one pork, and bought some drinks, including a lovely Tarrant Street IPA. When our food arrived, the pork roast had some apple sauce included, but we had to ask for horseradish sauce to go with the beef. It arrived quickly, but without a serving spoon.
Although mum-in-law's pork was OK, our beef was dry and overcooked. The roast potatoes were hard, dry and leathery and the Yorkshire pudding hard and dry as a bone. The parsnips were almost raw and inedible. This was food that had been standing a LONG time. I don’t tolerate bad food and, had we had a check-back, I would have voiced our dissatisfaction. However, none was forthcoming and, as the kitchen was a long way away and it was now after 3 o'clock, we thought we'd have to get on with it or go hungry.
This was one of the most expensive roast dinners I have had, but it was also one of the worst, only one I foolishly ordered from a Wetherspoons being worse.
If you can't keep food warm satisfactorily, then don’t sell it. My wife is a chef and knows how to keep food warm without spoiling and NOT to serve food that is no longer fit for eating. We’re local and will never come back, but it would be nice if other customers didn't have to endure such poor standards.

It is impossible to avoid seeing the screen of the game Halo!!!

104,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,26,Completely unacceptable standard of room,"We visited the Hilton this week and had booked a suite at a cost of £200.

On arrival the outside looks run down but we’re open minded as to the interior. Staff on arrival were friendly and check in process was smooth and quick.

However on arriving at our room all of this went quickly downhill! I cannot even express our disgust at the standard of the room at a Hilton property. Scuffed and peeling wallpaper and skirting boards, broken tiles in the bathroom, windows that were black in the wood. But worst of all of this was the huge patches of damp and water that was coming through the walls. My child suffers from asthma and there was no way we were staying in that room - it was a health hazard and completely unacceptable for any standards let alone a Hilton suite!

On returning to reception the staff were very good and moved us into another room which was of a better standard. However can’t help wondering why we weren’t put into this room in the beginning rather than the disgusting original room as it was empty?!

Just to note the new room wasn’t perfect either and was lacking a chain that actually flushed in the toilet with ease (you had to push the button with two hands and a lot of strength to get it to work!) but was better.

Cannot comment on other facilities as chose to eat out and spend the least amount of time possible at this place, but I can say the original room we were put in was a total rip off and wouldn’t have stayed there at £50 let alone £200! Again reiterate staff were helpful.

Photos speak for themselves of the room! Not impressed!

Outside could do with a lick of paint and the reception is looking old and tired compared to some more modern Premier Inn's however the staff were super friendly (Maurice was very hepful and great to have a chat with) and the rooms were very clean and of the new Premier Inn room design.

Bed was fantastic however we had to ask for a new pillow as one of them had a stain on the cover, this was quickly sorted though.

Lots of parking and breakfast wasn't too bad, however after visiting Arundel when we checked out, could probably have had breakfast at one of its many independant cafe's there for a better price.

372,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,37,Tots Break- Pretty Great,"We have just been on our first visit to Butlins in Bognor on a Just for Tots break with our 2.5 year old. She loved it, so much for her to do and varying in pace from physical activities like soft play and Little Tikes zone to calm quiet ones like crafts and Play Doh- a great mix. She loved the Teletubbies show in the pavilion and we also preferred this venue to the Centre Stage cabaret type room which was hot and stuffy and always over-crowded (you’d have to go in there about an hour prior to show time I’d say if you wanted to se use a table or near to stage view). We did get some seats but the tiering is not that elevated so she couldn’t see the stage but I imagine slightly older children would enjoy that part more.

For dining we ate in The Deck on the premium package and the food was excellent. So much choice and very tasty. Our accommodation was the Wave Hotel and our room was very clean and well-appointed.

The only niggle we had was that the photo counter is closed a lot (you can take a picture with some of the mascot characters- again queue for this if you can as the line soon builds up but was only about a 15 min wait). When I went to make a purchase the sales advisor suggested coming back at a later point as we could collect other pictures and add to the package- seemed a good idea. However the photos are only available to view the following day (I don’t know why). So we returned on the Wednesday morning to collect and pay for our pictures only to find it shut until midday- on a Wednesday which is a departure day!? Those on the 3 day break all leave on a Wednesday so why have it closed that morning? Opens at 12 we found out (not mentioned by the staff) and you have to leave site by 11.00. Our daughter is still talking about her teletubbies photo and how she wants to show her nanny but reading the ticket stub there is no way to obtain or download and pay for it now. Had these odd stall hours been highlighted by any of the team I would have just bought it on that first attempt! (Please do correct me if I’m wrong and we are able to but it now- photo was taken 2 days ago- as she’s desperate for this souvenir of her trip!)

Anyway yes overall we totally recommend the break. We weren’t able to make use of the pool sadly as daughter was getting over a chest infection but next time for sure

The room had a lot of missing items ( in a four stars hotel I pretend at least the fridge with at least one water bottle inside), the ceiling was stained, the room was hot even with the open windows and due to this it has been placed an old ventilator and a noisy movable conditioner, with hanging cables everywhere.
The indoor swimming pool had dirty water and floor around it and it hadn’t even the soap in the ( not illuminated) shower.
In the room there were cables and missed switches, one bed lamp was broken and not working.
In the night we were waked up by the fire alarm ( as all the hotel guests) due - they told us - to an alarm in one room ( or by a mis-contact as we suppose). Then at 6 in the morning it was noisily inserted a apology letter under the door, waking us up again.
We have chosen Hilton and not one of the ( many) other hotels because we supposed to have the grant of quality but we were totally wrong. We just paid a 4 star hotel price (270 pound for one night!) to sleep one night in a old, neglected, stinky hotel.

Toddler soft play a joke! Toddlers can’t do anything without and adult helping as the levels are too high.
We used to love coming to Butlin’s but it’s just too busy now.
My advise Butlin’s - Stop trying to cram all these people in! And bring the old pool back!

I’m going to stick to caravan parks - much more relaxed.

70,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,5,Terrible experience,"We spent 3 nights at the Wave hotel. On arriving back to our room on the final day we noticed our games console was missing. One of the controls had been thrown on the floor and the console itself was nowhere to be found. From the outset Butlins gave the impression it wasn’t really their problem. They called the resort officer to conduct a door audit to see who had been in and out of the room during that day. It showed only ourselves and housekeeping. They proceeded to check with housekeeping whether any one had found the missing item - and lo and behold - no one had.
We’ve since returned home and had a phone call to say that they haven’t been able to recover the item and their investigation ends there.
All I can say is to warn you - do not be too comfortable in Butlins accommodation. We made the mistake of not putting our valuables in the safe - I would advise everyone to do so to avoid being targeted by the thieves who hide amongst the housekeeping staff. We are lucky enough to have travelled all over the world and never had an item from our belongings stolen from our accommodation.
It was out of the ordinary for us to holiday in the UK and now this has put us off Butlins and the like for good!
My advice, don’t leave any valuables out, don’t trust housekeeping staff and don’t rely on the resort to offer any real help when things go wrong. Not a safe place where you can feel at home.

175,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,16,Butlins got the New Pool Wrong!!!,"Been coming to Butlins for 6years with a group of friends and their families. Every year sometimes 2x a year. I have a 12 and 10yo. The main attraction has always been the pool. They always spend 3hrs min in the pool. This weekend in the New Pool... we looked around and kids were so unimpressed they wanted to leave after 30mins!!!. The next day my oldest didnt bother. Stayed indoors! To think it was the one thing they were looking forward to!!! Butlins.. this pool is for 8yo and below. Nothing for older kids or adults. We loved the OLD POOL with the Big green slide that swooshed you into a deeper pool. The whirling pool with the sit and ride inflatables was awesome in the OLD POOL. In the New Pool we had to queue for 30 mins for a 10sec slide!!! And everywhere you go were toddlers!!!!! Such a shame. For the first time ever our large party is considering an alternative annual Staycation. Haven maybe... or Centre Parcs.

For that they have to be faultless and Nurses Cottage is in that category. Add to that the view over Arundel from the lounge/dining room, Lizzie’s flapjacks and friendliness and this is a great place to stay. Well appointed bedroom, en-suite and very comfortable bed, excellent breakfast.
Suffice to say we intend to revisit next summer. It’s a pleasant walk from the Cottage into Arundel along the River Arun to dine at the Townhouse, highly recommended! And a visit to Brighton to see the Royal Pavilion is a must.

I was disappointed for the money I spent, especially as the room suffered from no running water on Saturday morning.

This was almost twice the price of the local Premier Inn but at least with a Premier Inn, you know what you’re going to get.

The polite and friendly staff were the only saving grace for this place.

Definitely the worst Hilton I’ve stayed at.

Nothing was too much trouble for Lizzie and Paul. On arrival Lizzie made us a cup of tea with home made biscuits and flapjacks in their cosy guest living room. The bedroom was lovely, freshly decorated, very clean, great views of Arundel Castle with an en-suite bathroom. The bed was huge and very comfortable and the bathroom had l’occitane toiletries plus disposable toothbrushes etc. should you have forgotten anything. Breakfast was great, with everything you could want including eggs from Lizzie and Paul’s own chickens in the garden. Would definitely stay again and could highly recommend Nurses Cottage.

140,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,124,Fantastic!,"Stayed here for three nights in February. We stayed in a Deluxe Room in Oyster Bay which was great. The room came with a dedicated car parking space just outside. Downstairs there is a patio area with the patio doors opening into the living room with a fridge and tea/coffee making facilities. Upstairs there is a twin bedroom with a balcony and a bathroom. The room is also really close to the main resort area, which is very convenient. We didn't choose a dining plan as we wanted to have freedom of choice for the restaurants. Our favourite eating place was the Beachcomber Inn. The staff are so friendly and helpful and the food comes our super quick and is of good quality. We ate in Papa John's one night, but it was very chaotic and it took a long time to get served. We also ate in The Diner for lunch one day, which we really enjoyed. Again, the staff were great and the food was delicious and served quickly. We mostly stayed in the Centre Stage for evening entertainment. We tried Reds one night, but definitely preferred Centre Stage. Thoroughly enjoyed the entertainment on offer. The Sleeping Beauty panto was laugh out loud, as was Cirque du Hilarious. Great music entertainment too, with Abba and Little Mix tributes. Loved the chilled out vibe of Lounge Rosso to enjoy cocktails and softails. We tended to use the swimming pool between 3pm and 5pm when it was a little bit quieter, still busy, but not too manic. We liked the lazy river and the wave pool, and we will definitely be re-visiting to try out the new swimming pool that is opening. Unfortunately one of the fairground rides was closed due to technical difficulties when we were there, but we did enjoy the ones that were open. In particular, we enjoyed it when the fairground was open late on the Sunday evening. We booked four payable activities when we were there....zip wire, segways, high ropes and archery. It was just me and my daughter, so she roped me into doing all of the activites, meaning I was the only adult on all of them apart from the archery haha. The activities staff were absolutely fantastic, they made it lots of fun and made us feel very welcome. The arcades are great, lots of choice, although it's easy to spend a fortune collecting tickets in exchange for prizes! We didn't cash in our tickets this time, we will save them for our next visit....which will be very soon!! In conclusion, absolutely loved this place, thank you Butlins!

251,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,126,"Looks nice, reasonable value but VERY noisy","We stayed here solely because we were attending a wedding and the room was pretty cheap. There was a long queue at check-in and rather brusque staff.

The room itself was ok (122) apart from the fact that the bathroom door only opened about halfway before being blocked by the sink.

Drinks and food in the hotel were pretty expensive. Service at the bar was VERY slow and on one occasions I had to go and hunt down a member of staff to serve us.

But the WORST thing about the place is what appears to be a complete lack of soundproofing! You could hear people in other rooms in all directions - and the corridor seemed to have been specifically designed to be noisy to walk along with the characteristics of an echo chamber.

So, in summary, pretty cheap - for obvious reasons.

There is always a wide selection of top quality fish and meat, which always arrives perfectly cooked. Attractive presentation, reasonable quantities.

Although prices are a little higher than we normally pay we all felt value for money was good given the top quality food, first class service, and general ambience.

256,Bailiffs Court,Accommodation,Littlehampton,Hotel,29,Quirky property and that’s where the fun ends ....,"During our 24 hour stay, I’m not sure we met a single person who knew what they were doing. And that’s not for the lack of staff. After what felt like a reluctant ‘end of shift’ welcome at the front desk, we were shown to our room at the other side of the site. The guy showing us around didn’t know the facilities and referred us to a new guide in the room and said everything we needed to know would be in there. We we’re left thinking why bother and just provide the key? However when we found our way around the room we just felt it lacked facilities and was old and antiquated - in need of an upgrade!
We had paid for one of the more expensive rooms with a four poster bed. This was probably the best part about it. The rooms are poorly equipped; an old sofa facing and dirty tv in a sitting room area, no mini bar despite being far from the main part of the hotel, large bathroom but the shower stopped working half way through washing and left one of us roaming the room for 15 mins covered in soap. We tried to call reception to report and get some help, but we’re told ‘turn all the taps on and that should reset it’. This didn’t work so we called back at which point they sent someone from house keeping, who on arrival said ‘I can’t help you’. We gave up, sat for a further 15 mins and had another go. Fortunately some cold water had returned enabling a rinse before dinner. We reported this when back at the house and received a £100 discount on the bill and an offer to move rooms. Having already wasted time and feeling frustrated, we stayed where we were to avoid the hassle of packing and unpacking again. We thought we’d just get up and leave in the morning.
The main house and restaurant are essentially a network of little rooms with a mish mash of chairs - plus the main restaurant. We were early for dinner and thought we’d grab a drink. We struggled to find anywhere to sit and when we did couldn’t to find anyone to serve us as they were all stood around chatting. They forgot to call us for dinner and after 15 mins we had to go and find someone. Sat at the table we were presented with a mostly empty bread basket and no choice, so declined, only to see full baskets with more choice being offered later. It took an hour and a quarter to receive our main course despite pre-ordering 90 mins earlier and we had to pour our own wine. The food was actually very good when it arrived.
Breakfast in the morning wasn’t much better as we sat forgotten waiting for coffee for 20 mins. We complained and were then asked what we had ordered again as it had been put in the bin. The hap hazard service continued as I received two poached eggs that were hard and looked like they’d been on the floor.
On top of this we paid a premium price for two spar treatments on day one. The treatments were actually very good but the-facilities, much like most of the buildings needed a good clean. Staff just stand around despite there being dirty cups and plates in the relaxation room, along with crumbs on the furniture. Towels just littered the place in the changing rooms and by the pool. Garden umbrellas lean against the wall inside, which just says we don’t care about presentation. The food and drinks are really expensive in the Spa and not great quality either. Two sandwiches and one glass of wine for £35.
All in all we felt it was a really poor experience. When we explained our disappointment at check out we were still only offered a miserly £100 off the final bill of nearly £1000. They advertise a luxury, unique experience but the reality couldn’t be further from the truth. Unique in its incompetence maybe.
We had paid the majority upfront when reserving our rooms but we left without paying the final amount in disgust given they weren’t prepared to take our comments and thoughts seriously. The arrogance in dismissing our experience as purely ‘our opinion’ is a further amateur hour outrage. We await a call...

AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!

Easy to find, just off the A27, with plenty of parking. Maurice, on reception, was very helpful and efficient, checking in went smoothly, and whilst the building looked a little “tired” from the outside, internally it was fine. Maurice also demonstrated that he still retains a good understanding of “fashion” when he picked out the winner of our “best shirt” competition on our first night. Good choice, Maurice.

The adjacent Beefeater Restaurant was well up to the usual Beefeater standards, and all staff were full of smiles and energy, despite being very busy on the Saturday night. Chloe, our waitress on Saturday, was particularly charming and polite – thank you Chloe.

A little more expensive than many of the Premier Inns we stay at but still good value for money.

When we arrived our room looked nothing like the pictures on the website. It was very small, the en suite smelt damp, the shower had black mould on the grouting, lightbulbs weren’t working, the wardrobe was a tiny cupboard in the eves and we had to bend down to hang clothes up.

We went into the garden to have drink and the garden was very pretty. However only very few of the rattan chairs had cushions on, and the glass table was absolutely filthy. We intended eating in the restaurant but this put us off and we went into the village instead.

The good points: the bedding was good quality, the towels fluffy, and whilst the breakfast was very basic, with limited choice, the eggs were very nicely poached.

This is a low-budget 2 star hotel with a 4 star label and even worse - 4 star prices. We paid £129 for one night for this sub-standard room!!!

The rooms were in poor state of decoration and cleanliness (see pictures). On arrival people with the same surnames and room types were allocated rooms on the opposite site of the hotel to each other where common sense would suggest that they would want to be close to each other. Rooms for disabled people were at the bottom of the garden in an annex a short drive away? That said the food was good and catering/bar staff tried hard to impress and the events manager on the Saturday night was awesome, even tricky problems that were not under his control he took on and sorted them. In summary good staff except the lack of common sense on room allocation but the venue is tired and needs a refurbishment which is a shame as the location opens up great potential.

The changing rooms were nice and large however, they were filthy with rubbish, hair and even what looked like blood wiped down the wall with a finger! There was also hair and floating skin in the puddles in the queues up the stairs to the family raft. In the baby pool there seemed to be something floating in the water that looked like phlegm/snot! There were even people swimming with their outdoor clothes on. Totally unhygienic.
The slides had massive queues (fair enough when its holiday season) but when the queue time is made even longer than it should because they do not have enough rafts to cater for demand. Staff said they started off with 7 rafts but are down to only 4 now. Sort this out managers instead of making people wait longer than the queue time says. 20 minute expected time took 35 minutes just for a slide ride over in less than 30 seconds!
Teenagers were pushing in the queues in front of smaller children, including running and barging past, when I raised this issue with a member of staff nothing was said or done about it.
Two of the slides were also under 18's only. I don't see the sense in that when there were some teenagers around 12 stone or more when there were much smaller/petite adults wanting to go on. It should be done on weight NOT AGE! Never seen a large slide closed to adults anywhere else.
In all, a total and utter let down, badly managed and not once did I see anyone cleaning the filth during open hours. Other leisure centres have staff walking around with watering cans to rinse away hair and grime.
Such a shame it is going to rack and ruin already with no standards for peoples health and safety.

I declined this and said I would review this service once I return home from my trip.

The room I stayed in was room 11. This was at the top of the hotel in what felt like the furthest corner. The hotel had a funny smell which wasn’t very pleasant.

The room was ok but you could tell that it needed some work with it- bath had a hole in that looked like it was filled in with some putty. The paint was knocked and chipped away. I was rather disappointed and felt I would’ve been better off at a local travel lodge.

The hotel was dead and it felt like I was the only person in it- no offer for upgrade like most hotels would offer. I felt like the hotel cared more about the money than customer service and experience.

The food did smell nice but due to poor experience from start I ended up going to local competition which I was glad of.

I spoke to family who live in area and they laughed at me when I said I was staying in this hotel- they advised its been going backwards in recent years.

392,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,10,Not expected standard for a Hilton Hotel,"Booked this through booking,com and after booking, read the reviews on here and would have cancelled,however because of Goodwood Races, there was no availability anywhere else.
I read that the rooms were of a poor standard, however renovation was being done, so I rang and requested a newly decorated room, this was ok but nothing special and obviously a makeover doesnt extend to flaking paint on window frames, wasnt impressed with the cleaning of the room, lots of cobwebs that had obviously been there some time.
The hotel needs a major overhaul, the paintwork, decoration and carpets in most areas is apalling. The creakibg floor boards in the corridors were awful, how the people staying in those rooms got any rest is beyond me!
Price of drinks is quite expensive. We ordered two cocktails and when the waitress bought them over, she spilt most of one on the table and down my husbands trousers, she never even came back to clean the table, and we had to ask for it to be cleaned.
Food was quite good, not much choice on the menu for a Saturday evening though.
This place has the potential to be amazing but at the moment its just a shabby disappointment.

55,Sea View,Accommodation,Littlehampton,Hotel,41,Really very poor,"This is a rather belated review of our visit to the Sea View Pub/Hotel in East Preston on Easter Saturday, a few weeks ago. The review is in respect of the pub not the hotel itself – we live nearby so were just visiting for lunch and drinks.
It was our first visit and I have to say was disappointing in the extreme. We had in fact called in a few months previously after walking into East Preston and the barman had shown us the menu which included a fish platter (I can not remember the exact words or description).
However, when we arrived on Easter Saturday, we were told that with the exception of the plaice, they had no other fish at all (a fish platter was not on the menu but that is fair enough I guess as menus do change). We sat down with a drink and perused the menu and further disappointment arrived when we went to order.
As well as no “ordinary” fish they did not even have fish fingers for a sandwich and when I ordered ham was told “It’s still being cooked”.
We therefore settled on two x plaice and two x warm chicken and bacon salad.
It must be said that my wife and her brother who had the plaice described it as delicious (and that is the only thing that saved this from being a one star review). However the chicken and bacon salad were woefully lacking in either chicken or bacon!! Really poor.
With the exception of the barman (I think called Jamie) the rest of the people serving or hovering round the bar, who I think were the owners were all rather aloof and certainly not particularly welcoming.
To summarise, the two plaice meals were excellent, the service was not great and to have so many dishes unavailable at lunchtime on Easter Saturday is unforgivable (the pub was quiet at that stage so it was not because they had served lots before we arrived).
I can not comment on the hotel/bedrooms as we did not see them – I would add, however, that the stairway to the top of the building can be seen when accessing the toilets and the walls have peeling wallpaper and look distinctly unappealing.
As above, this really should be a one star review but the plaice meals meant I could not do that in all fairness.",2.0,2.0,0,1

206,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,10,Total let down.,"We have been visiting Butlins Skegness as a family for many years now and decided to try Bognor as a change for 2019. This was a mistake on our part. This is the holiday of ""No you can't."" The water park was much smaller than we imagined after it's billing. Once inside some of the slides have a manufacturer recommendation of no under 18s. So a 6 foot 2 17 year old lad at 15 stone is ok, but a 5 foot lady of 40 is barred? Makes sense. Never seen a slide with that disclaimer. Rammed beyond belief, our two young children bumped and bashed over constantly. The rooms were not as clean as expected and for self catering we were used to having basic things such as the fridge being switched on ready so we could put our food in, especially in hot weather and a tin opener. Shame this Butlins didn't consider that. The forks had thick black residue on the sides of the prongs. Horrible. TV didn't work for full duration. The whole place has been packed like sardines. Way too many people here. Intimidating when you are only three and in a huge crowded area for a show. Plus no account for disabilities. My wife had only standing room for one event. Red Coats just stare blankly when asked for help or reasons. The amount of smokers walking around and not in the smoking areas in a family park was surprising. I could go on, kids being refused autographs as they has bought the ""wrong"" merchandise (over double the price) of the goods that were allowed was really the last straw. Particular mention to Braydon here who gave some nonsense about the type of pen being used until I told him I work with autographs and then admitted he didn't really know why and walked off when I told him what a poor time we were having in general. We won't be back, a real shame as this was a celebration of a family members return to health after a horrendous 18 months. Gandeys Circus was good, except for that the children's foam hands were stolen from under their seats. Will be looking forward to going home. If we are to make it back to Butlins, it won't be here.

The campsite owners were friendly and helpful and really care about their business. The site is safe and very family friendly, and our kids loved going off exploring. The pitch sizes were good and the showers excellent. You are allowed to make campfires, but you must use logs purchased from the site - this is the same as other sites that we have visited in the uk. The price for the logs is £7 per bag, which is also reasonable.

14,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,3,Family 4 holiday,"First time at a butlins for our family of 4. As we had two young children we chose to go on tots week. Firstly accommodation is somewhat looking very tired and old, definitely need to update the apartments. The whole time we where there, the accommodation reception was open once despite opening times saying it should of been open most days, so on leaving day a lot of people posted room cards through the door. We did have a spacious adapted room for medical needs so can not complain on space. We did find peices of glass on the floor which showed the apartment is not hovered on a regular basis.

Day time entertainment is brilliant; lots to do especially for young children and the new splash pool is brilliant. Evening entertainment was poor, main show was too long for under 5's and we noticed a lot of restless children including our own. The mini disco was not the traditional mini disco more like English nursery rhymes. Entertainment after show was lacking, may of been due to tots week but entertainment finished by 8pm.

Overall it was an ok holiday disappointing for a Butlins first experience. Been to other UK parks with better evening entertainment aimed at all ages. Not sure will be a returning customer.

We enjoyed a delicious meal tonight, I had the chicken supreme, the chicken was beautifully cooked with a lovely rich creamy mushroom sauce. My husband went for the venison and also Could not fault it, and even though we were pretty full from the generous size portion of mains we still managed a pudding.

112,Norfolk Arms,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,25,Disappointed,"Unfortunately it’s a lovely central hotel in the little town of Arundel that lacks finesse. The room was suitable for purpose in a back courtyard that was quite and unobtrusive. The most disappointing thing about our stay was the disgusting and virtually inedible breakfast. The cold buffet was mediocre (dried up cheese, ham with dried edges- looked a day old) in comparison to other hotels I’ve stayed in, I asked for a hot chocolate and was told no only tea or coffee, so asked for a flat white and was told no that wasn’t possible so decided on tea which was obviously what they wanted me to have! Anyway let me really tell you about the so say Norfolk Arms Full English breakfast. One shrivelled tomato that was so dried up it was like a rock, a hash brown so deep fried the grease was oozing out, a piece of bacon that was dried up and burnt, inedible scrambled egg that was more like dried shoe leather in a flat thin section, a cold piece of black pudding, cold beans and mushrooms that had the most dreadful flavour of as I’d imagine old socks.. the only good thing was the one tiny little sausage that was probably a local specialty.. I wish I’d just had sausages!! I can honestly say if this place had a decent chef you would not have to go elsewhere, but if you can avoid breakfast do as there are loads of other places in the town that you can eat at! Hotel staff were pleasant and polite.

328,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,7,Christmas @ Butlins,"After being a little apprehensive about staying at Butlins I have to say I have been so impressed. We stayed in a seaside apartment, there was 3 adults and 3 children. The apartment was clean and very comfortable, the decor was nice and the layout was brilliant. Lots of space and not too far from check-in and resort.
There was loads to do for our kids, the Santa experience, shows, activities, restaurants, parks, fairground, it was everything they needed. I like that you didn't have to pay to do extras as with 3 kids it becomes too much for us then. The waterpark is brilliant, we've done lots of water parks and it's probably one of the beast we've been to. The kids loved it and there was things for our 5 year old and 10 year old so good balance. The staff have been brilliant, there is people everywhere; when we arrived we were greeted by people at every corner making sure we knew where to do. They had our pack ready and had organised our times for the Christamas events really well. We asked to change our santa visit and the lady was happy to do that for us. Its fairly busy but it's been managed well. We are very impressed, well done @butlins!

The dining options are not good value, high prices for very average food, Papa Johns is the best choice especially the buffet.

I was shocked when I walked into my room to see how poorly kept and badly maintained the room was.

Wallpaper was stained and peeling off the walls.

Skirting boards were cracked and coming away from the walls.

Ceiling in the room was showing cracks and starting to bow.

Ceiling and walls in the bathroom were covered in damp patches and the paint was flaking off.

Dead flies on window sill and all edges of the window the sealant was cracked and covered in grime.

For the price I paid this is honestly the worst Hotel I have ever stayed in and the Hilton should be ashamed to be charging people to stay in such a shocking environment.

When I approached the front desk staff they said they would offer me a discount of £20 as a good will gesture.

341,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,11,Awful stay,"I booked a 4 night break to Butlins in Bognor Regis for my son’s 2nd birthday. We arrived on Monday 10th June to find there was no entrance for those on foot (we travelled by train) we then had to stand in the pouring rain until a staff member found our booking and told us where to check in. You cannot enter your apartment until 4pm so that is a waste of 1 day. We got to our standard apartment in Egret Avenue to discover cigarette ends and broken glass outside the door. Entering the property there was a distinct smell of cannabis. It got worst the more I looked around the apartment. The table was broken, there was thick dust everywhere, the kitchen sides hadn’t been cleaned, there was chunks missing out the floor and table, the bathroom had blood marks on the walls and hair/dust everywhere. The toilet was broken and the whole apartment needed renovating. There was no way I was staying in that apartment regardless of price. I complained to the lady in the Oyster Bay Reception and showed her the pictures of the apartment. She rang someone who said I can be moved to a different apartment. Luckily enough we were moved right next door to my sister and her family. We decided to check out what the resort had on offer... except everything was shut except the arcades and a few restaurants. I assumed it was because it was late in the evening. The next morning my fiancé was making us a cup of tea when the kettle blew up and threw boiling water all over the kitchen narrowly missing my son. This had also tripped the electrics meaning we had no electricity. My partner went to guest services and explained what had happened. He was told it was a priority and would be sorted within 2 hours and someone would come and clean up the water. We stayed in the apartment for 3 hours waiting, but no one turned up. We had to go out as my son was throwing an absolute fit at being stuck indoors. I assumed someone may come and sort it whilst we were out. Unfortunately not. We got home to no electricity and a wet floor still. My fiancé decided to sort the electrics himself and we cleaned up the floor. My fiancé is Type 1 diabetic and needs the fridge to keep his insulin cold. Luckily the fridge remained at a cool level. We never heard anything back from guest services or maintenance during our short stay. We then decided to take advantage of the new swimming pool. Unfortunately the main pool and wave pool was much too cold for my son. He ended up with blue lips so we had to leave there. The children's pools were warm, but much too crowded to actually do anything. We then decided to do some rides, only to find it all shut down. We had no idea that pretty much everything on the resort shuts at 5pm. In summer. Including the pool. This is ridiculous. We decided to go and try The Diner for dinner... which was shut. Then we thought we will try Scoop the ice cream parlour, this was also shut. By this point I had already had enough. What the hell did I pay £400+ for? They charge you for EVERYTHING regardless if you have a pass. Want to ride a go cart? That’s £6 per go! Want to ride a dune buggy? That’s £2 for 1 go. Want to ride the new VR machines? That’s £5 per person. Want to play mini golf? Thats more money. Want to rent a family bike? Thats £9 for 30 minutes. We couldn’t use the outside parks because they were under maintenance. We couldn’t use the soft play throughout our stay as 1 it was just too busy and 2 the toddler section was overrun by bigger kids bullying little ones. So our days consisted of walking around or spending more money on the arcades. I was extremely disappointed. On Wednesday evening after another nightmare of a day (being turned away from the pool because it was for hotel users only in the morning, to finding restaurants shut again and eating the same thing for the third time) we decided enough was enough and we left Thursday a day earlier than planned. There was no one in guest services or reception to check out or to complain to, so we dropped our keys in a box and left. I have never EVER been so appalled by a resort for families in my life. I will never go back. I’ve complained via email and asked for a full refund.

304,Norfolk Arms,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,27,Sunday Lunch,"We were looking forward to having Sunday lunch with friends at the Castle Restaurant.
We found the Hotel car park at the rear of the hotel, but after entering through a barrier, I went to get a permit to park the car and was told we would have to pay £10 to park, as we were not staying at the hotel(WHY) the car park was empty!!! Bearing in mind we were about to spend over £100 for lunch. We then left and parked in the road free.
We then went back in to get a coffee while waiting for our friends. The barman looked like we had asked for something unusual ( 2 Americanos), he went across the courtyard as that was where the coffee machine was!
Our friends arrived and the waiter was hovering waiting for us to take our place at our table, this was now about 1pm, the restaurant was completely empty! We were surprised as it was Sunday lunch. We were then told that some of the choices on the menu were not available, the roast only included chicken or Pork Belly(not what you would expect on a Sunday no Roast Beef!). However the food was ok really nothing that exceptional.
Where were all the people, very soulless, heated by a fan heater although they did have an open fire! After time a couple came in for lunch and another for a cream tea.
We left quite disappointed and will not return. We have been to some really superb restaurants in the area nothing like this.

The place has had a massive overhaul, our apartment was sparkling - new carpets, new windows, heating that worked! The only niggle was that lots of food outlets were shut or had very odd opening hours. I've never seen a Burger King closed when people were around who wanted to spend money. Papa John's, whilst having gorgeous, heppy, helpful staff, wasn't great as far as the pizza went. I like pizza base a lot, I'd like it better if the toppings they put on it had been bigger than a sparrow's breakfast; really stingy and no flavour. What do they do to them? I made a mental note to avoid there next time - I made a mental note to avoid it this time too but I forgot. That aside, it was a great weekend and Butlin's staff were a delight. We spent a simlar weekend in Pontin's at Prestatyn a few years ago and that was a bit like a short stay in a badly run refugee camp, so top marks to Butlin's for excellent staff training and for employing human beings and not angry gorillas.

The exterior and interior is in need of a lick of paint. The bedroom and bathroom was clean and comfortable but basic and in need of new fittings. The hotel is OK but it lacks charm, the greater part being because it’s interior needs a complete makeover.
The kitchen staff need Gordon Ramsay to go in and shake them up. The chicken skewer I had tasted nothing like chicken. It was slimy and rather unpleasant.

145,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,11,Christmas Fantasy,"We visited on 14th December 2018 for the Christmas Fantasy experience. We stayed in a self catering apartment in Guillemot way and it was very basic and in need of some thorough cleaning/repairs and TLC.
We arrived a bit late on the Friday and struggled to get parked, I had to get out leaving my partner with the car and kids in order to grab the keys and welcome pack to get in to our apartment as we couldn't find anywhere near to park. It was dark and I struggled to find guest services as I had never been there before (they do not have drive in check in desks like they do in Skegness).
We eventually found our apartment and it was really quite far for us to walk with all our belongings, a baby and two toddlers.
The parking situation is terrible, you have to get there early to get a space, we got there about 8pm and it was stressful trying to offload our belongings, our family and finding a space to park.
The first full day the weather was bad and all the outdoor activities were cancelled which meant that everyone was crammed in to the Skyline and it was horrific, the soft play area was bursting at the seams and we could see children getting knocked over by kids running past so we didn't let ours go in (much to their disappointment), there was not enough tables for us to sit down at and it was hard to see anything on stage as everyone was standing at the sides so you couldn't see anything let alone the toddlers trying to see. It was a struggle walking past as there were people EVERYWHERE trying to watch the entertainment and blocking the way past. There were queues for most things and a noticeable amount of parents having a lot to drink and ignoring their feral children, sometimes you would hear some of them swearing loudly and it made me feel uncomfortable as I don't want my children to be exposed to language like that.
In our guest pack we received tickets to see Santa in the Character theatre at 7pm on Saturday 15th Dec (which I thought was a bit late for a 2 and 4 year old), we assumed there was a show but when we got there we just got in to a long queue on the left hand side of the theatre, the kids called out for Santa who came out on a stage, then just sat down with the kids in their respective family groups on stage, had a brief chat with them, gave them a chocolate selection box and posed for a photo before being told to exit the other side of the stage. A couple of minutes at the most, pretty disappointing.
I have since found out from other people who went at the same time as us, that they all saw a Christmas show in the theatre or had a private Santa experience in his grotto so I'm baffled as to why we didn't receive either of those experiences.
We ate at Papa J's restaurant, it wasn't particularly busy and a few things were forgotten by the staff I.e. plates for the children despite asking for them twice so my partner and I ate our meals off the plates the starters came on. The food was absolutely delicious and fairly good value for money in comparison to some of the other places, I would definitely recommend eating here.
The swimming pool changing rooms were dirty, like really dirty and not necessarily from people using it that day but in desperate need of a deep clean. There were dirty nappies on the floor, bodily fluids including blood smears and bogeys on the walls and the floor was filthy.
I didn't see anyone cleaning in there at any stage, not even wiping the changing room floor which meant we had to put towels down in order to get changed and not get completely covered in dirt which meant our towels were so dirty we couldn't go swimming again during our stay.
We had forgotten the baby's swimming costume and had to look for a suitable suit, well there was only a pair of cheaply made trunks (nothing else in his size) and it cost us £10!!! I mean come on, his little swimsuit from Next didn't even cost that much, it really did take me aback but needs must. Well the trunks didn't fit him in the slightest they were massively too big and kept falling down, I feel that this aspect should be looked in to by Butlins as the trunks were incorrectly sized and extortionate, almost taking advantage of people who have no alternative.
During our time in the pool my partner took my little boy to the loo where a two young lads (one was a lifeguard and the other was dressed all in red) were having a loud conversation about one of the lads having an STI!!! Thankfully my little boy wasn't listening as we didn't fancy explaining to him what an STI was and it's a wholly inappropriate conversation to be having in a place mainly full of children.
By Sunday we had had enough so went off the site and went to Bognor beach and pier for the day and ate in a local pub, The Regis (Brewers fayre) which also had a soft play inside which the kids loved, we returned back to Butlins and decided to pack up and leave early (was due to stay until Monday).
All in all a bit of a let down and wouldn't recommend.

176,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,28,Loving the new pool,"Went to Butlins for day visit to check out the new pool. It’s brilliant, loads of slides and areas for all ages. Nice warm water so little ones are happy. Lots of life guards. It’s very open so easy to spot members of the family. My only criticism is the cleanliness of the changing area. Fab facilities but sadly didn’t look like it had been cleaned all day. Loads of changing rooms for all party sizes, lockers, hair dryers and swimsuit spinners and bags. Butlins please don’t ruin it by not keeping it clean. We also spent loads of time in fairground, loads of rides for all ages. Disappointing that fairground, soft play and pool shut at 5. We had a great day and will defiantly be back, hopefully to stay in one of the lovely hotels. 😀

394,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,1,Gets worse every year,"Third year we've been here and got progressively worse each year. Now Butlins is popular again they've given up trying to improve, and it shows. Fewer staff, grubby, no where to park, people smoking in non-smoking areas, queue jumping constantly, throwing dirty nappies on the floor. Butlins seems to bring out the worst in people, generally just couldn't care less about anyone else.

New pool is far too busy with 50min queues for the flumes, and again people just pushing in. Staff could not care less. Wife was told to f-off when she called out a man and his family for doing it. This one incident tells you all you need to know about this place. If you're a half-way decent family, save your money for Center Parcs or go abroad. You won't enjoy it here.

Kids enjoyed it on the whole, but even they got upset at other people's behaviour. New panto is nowhere near last year's standard and Mr Men show was the same as last year. Didn't see any characters walking around. Seems like they've given up.

Wave hotel is looking grubby, in need of some major TLC. Deck restaurant is too busy, food mediocre, floors sticky and men's toilet floor soaked with urine and who knows what else. Has gone down hill massively since we first started coming - no way we'll be back.

We booked an executive room, but to be honest we felt this was not so, we found our room had a tidy clean bed and clean bath, toilet sink etc, but the dust in this room was not acceptable, dusty walls, and dirty window sills, dusty shelves and hair on shelves as well. dirty behind bathroom bin, and just really mucky when looking close. We did tell the receptionist when we left who firstly said it was just a days dust which that would could have accepted, but this was months of dust, which was totally unacceptable, she apologised and made a note. Everything else was good, the staff were nice, the breakfast was lovely and plenty of it for the price. Please Norfolk Arms Hotel, give your rooms and deep clean now and again!

Good onsite parking; great location on the seafront; good breakfast who easily dealt with my gluten free menu; very impressed with the service of all the staff; beds are very comfortable, which is important, however, I did find room 45 on the 1st floor very hot & stuffy, even without the heating on in December; never experienced any noise from other rooms. Great top quality food in the restaurants. One of the best parts of our stay was the indoor heated pool; it really is worth taking your swim wear with you, the pool is lovely and warm and a great way to relax.
Overall, a great stay for anyone.

121,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,28,Summer holiday,"We are Butlins regulars having previously visited both minehead and Skegness as we have not been to Bognor before, we decided to give it a go. While they offer the full set of activities, the same as the other two, this site is our least favorite. It seems to be a lot smaller and less organized. Everything feels crammed in with a lack of areas around the accommodation where kids can play. If your kids want to kick a ball, you have too walk to the other side of the site. The site feels dirtier, lots of litter around and they don’t seem to keep up with maintenance as well with the accommodation feels old and falling into disrepair. The staff are really friendly and helpful but the site itself just feels old and dirty. The queues to get into places are long, upto 45 minutes to get into the swimming pool at times, and the food courts feels as though it is under staffed with having to wait for food to be bought out at the buffet and tables to be cleared. The staff look stressed and hassled, just not enough people to get the job done and the manager of the food court seems to be like a deer caught in the headlights.

As a family, we love Butlin’s and everything they have to offer to especially to keep kids busy and active, but when we come to book again for next year, it will definitely be either Skegness or Minehead. In our opinion, Skegness is by far the best, it is just a shame that it is the furthest away from us.

357,Norfolk Arms,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,54,Overpriced,"We stayed on the 14th June and assumed that we would be staying in the main building which is a beautiful old coaching inn, but no we were in the Annexe, that is the Premier Inn that is in the car park of the hotel. We stayed last year and had a fabulous room in the main building for less money. When I spoke to the duty manager she was ambivalent about the fact we felt the room was over priced and implied that we should have asked to be in the main building even though we were unaware of the existence of the annexe.
On the following Monday we stayed at The Spread Eagle hotel in Midhurst and we were on a room and dinner deal that was the same price as the Norfolk Arms room only and that was a lovely experience, we will not be returning to the Norfolk.

The staff was friendly, the room spacious and clean, and the heater made the room very cosy considering that the temperature outside went to -5 that night. The car park is small but we found a space easily.
There is a Burger King and a KFC within the same area, and a nice pub just a few minutes away (close to the other Travelodge).
The only negative point for us was the noise as our room faced the A27 so we could clearly hear any motorbikes and noisy vehicles during the night.

73,Bailiffs Court,Accommodation,Littlehampton,Hotel,39,Beautiful Spa and grounds with Peacocks.,"Beautiful friendly spa with indoor and outdoor heated pools and hot tubs. Indulgent massages.

The hotel is arranged in different buildings. Previously I stayed in the thatched house which is connected by underground tunnel to the reception building. Beautiful ground floor medieval feeling cosy rooms. This time I stayed in a Climping Original room in the gate house on the first floor; a rustic on the outside but tastefully decorated, spacious inside with roll top bath.

Both rooms were relaxing luxury with comfortable double beds and a choise of pillows. Tea making facilities in room. Furniture is either antique or tasteful reproduction.

The history of the hotel tells you although it looks medieval it was actually built using reclaimed materials and even entire buildings circa 1930...when to do this was unusual.

The breakfast was a bountiful buffet plus cooked breakfast. The even meal was great although rather expensive if not on a deal.

Not an inexpensive place but worth a visit to stay over or as a day spa visitor for a treat or special celebration.

30,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,3,Centerparcs this is NOT,"With a young family we have stayed at Centerparcs many times and thought we'd give Butlins a try.

We booked a Nelson stateroom in the Shoreline Hotel, arriving on the hottest weekend this year.
 The air conditioning was broken. It took the team 4 hours after much pestering to inform us it was not repairable(no surprise)
After a visit to assess the heat level they agreed it was not acceptable and we would be relocated.
This was to the Wave hotel, the other side of the complex. It was gone 8pm. We were unable to move the car as the Wave car park was full. We trapsed with kids in pyjamas ladden with bags across the complex,with not one teeny weeny offer of help of anysort.

So just be aware, that is the level of customer service they offer if things go wrong.

You can pay very good money but don't expect the level of courtesy to families that Centerparcs on the other hand offer.

On a positive note the show was great,rides well staffed, pool lovely(though not quite as good as Centerparcs) But be prepared for spending a long time queuing for ...everything!
Hope this may just help if you are considering a first visit with little ones.
We lost a precious day of a very short weekend break with overtired kids, thanks to Butlins.

150,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,5,Let down,"Stayed for a long weekend this month (June) it was ridiculously busy and wasn’t even school holidays! Hotel ocean was good can’t fault it. New pool would of been good fun if it wasn’t crammed with people, too busy waiting times on most the slides/flumes was between 20-40 waiting time, you couldn’t move without bumping into someone which with baby’s is dangerous. Also only saw one life guard around the hole pool other than the ones on the slides. They should have a max capacity or something as it was just so busy. The floors in the changing room were filthy with mud , clumps of hair and god knows what else. Around the resort wasn’t enough for toddlers. My child was just shy in heigh of almost every ride etc so was really disappointed in that. Only thing my child could to was play in the park or indoor soft play but as I’ve said before it’s just to busy. Not enough for adults to do either. We took ourselves out of the resort 2 out of 4 days as was too busy and not enough to do. Also much better mini golf and ice cream parlour outside the resort! Restaurants are ok but nothing special.

Firstly the staff are amazing. Calum and reni who ran the day events were brilliant. They got to know my kids names and made so much effort everytime We saw them. My kids wanted to take part in the events so they could play with the 2 of them.

The show team were also equally amazing. Shanice and her team. Josh, Emily x2 and Kayleigh all the rest.
The others were brilliant. The resort was quiet this week and they got To know my girls which made the experience personal And even better. Despite the small number of guest they put 110% in to every performance/meet and greet. They had my kids on stage multiple times for various things. It was my youngest 4th birthday and they made such a effort for her. Inviting her on stage and getting the audience to sing happy birthday to her. She still won’t stop talking about it.

The staff really made the trip. There was a couple of minor gripes. The caravan smelt of sewage on a fair few occasions, lack of equipment that worked fully for Callum to work with and some of cleanliness around park wasn’t great.

These small things didn’t ruin the trip and we hope to be back later in the year. Thank you to all the staff for working so hard and going the extra mile all the time.

This was just as nice as before and my other half very much enjoyed her G&T with an amazing iceberg floating in it along with a slice of passion fruit.
The room was comfortable if a little chilly at first (we don't like it too hot in the bedroom at night so this was fine!).
everyone is very friendly and helpful, live music in the restaurant was ""just right"", not too loud to spoil a conversation but a peaceful background. The food was very good and the only drawback to the Swan is the lack of parking and cost of a day in the nearby car park (if you can get a space.

219,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,13,Good day but not as described,"Visited for the day with our little girl (9 months) and although we ended up having a nice day that was more because we made the most of it, rather than because of the site and facilities. Feel like the website is incredibly misleading, and wouldn't recommend it for those with very young children.
Firstly with the mini fairground, swimming and entertainment we felt like we were given an impression that there would be plenty for us to do with our daughter. However everything had height restrictions on and we were not able to accompany her on the rides either. That meant the only thing she could really go on were the paid for rides in the arcade. Not sure what the point is of a mini fairground if those who can't ride the main fairground rides are excluded!
We'd planned on the swimming being a big part of our day, and having read the website we had high expectations. The changing village 'designed with mumsnet' featured several rave reviews so we were looking forward to using them. However to be blunt they are like any other changing rooms I've ever visited, just with a seat belted chair for children in each changing cubicle. The underfloor heating promises 'no more soggy socks' but must have been off on the day we visited as there was a good few centimetres of standing water everywhere - including the toilets! It was a horrible experience really, we wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.
We also had a terrible experience in the pub-style restaurant on site, with slow service, poor prices and terrible value, limited availability from the menu, staff who didn't listen to requests and low quality food.
Both the meals my wife and I wanted were unavailable, and there was no coke zero. We also asked for no ice in the cokes and they were packed full. Our wait for food was long despite the pub being quiet and when it arrived the portion sizes were terrible for £6/7, note the 'side salad', and my chicken & bacon bbq wrap tasted awful.
The bar/bowling area was great and we enjoyed that, although it was bizarre we found the best changing facilities here.
Overall perhaps we were naive to take our little one at such a young age, but we booked based on the info online and feel mislead. Wouldn't recommend for very young families.

People outside our front door smoking constantly, my apartment stinks. Not good butlins. Especially for a family friendly place.

391,Norfolk Arms,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,44,Very comfortable hotel with great service,"We stayed for two nights which we found was an ideal base for exploring Arundel and the surrounding area. The hotel is situated in town with parking at the rear which makes it really convenient for the shops, restaurants and the pubs.
Our room was a good size, very quiet and comfortable with the only draw back being it only had a bath with no shower, but I guess this was due to the low ceilings. We only dined at breakfast time and used the local restaurants in the evening as there is a great choice of quality establishments in the immediate area. Breakfast was good with three choices of cooked breakfast and continental for the healthy.
Service was excellent from all the staff and we could not fault it.

27,Premier Inn Bognor,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,17,Awful to be honest,"Service in restaurant terrible, food pretty poor, and the toaster burst into flames which the serving lady said ‘happens quite often’. The receptionist was lovely though, and the bed comfy. Had previous bad experience few years ago when there was a function on and they just didn’t have the staff to cope. Same thing happened this time. They know there’s a function in advance, so really not an excuse!

275,Royal Norfolk,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,2,My gosh. What an experience,"Well I’ll try to be polite as possible. I paid just under £100 for one night stay. As you enter the lobby you are greeted by broken tiles on the floor and a lovely lady who tries to up-sell you a room with sea views. Stupidly I took this option and unless I was sitting on top of the kettle in the corner of the room I could see no sea at all Infact all I could see was a derelict building and an empty car park. Apparently (after asking for the WiFi code) I was informed that the internet is only available on the room directly above the router, not weird at all really !! The bed served its purpose however I have thrown my wrist out trying to turn the radiator on. Moving on swiftly the breakfast is served at 8am downstairs, make sure you don’t enter this room at 7.58 am otherwise you are likely to be arrested and locked up for the rest of your life. As for the service itself it’s all plastic cups and forks that resemble garden pitchforks. We sat down in an empty room and was rudely greeted by the table police who aggressively told us that this table was not ours and we must sit at another one so in fear we agreed. The previous table remained unseated for the remainder of the breakfast serving. I’m not going to comment on the food itself, I simply haven’t got the the energy however I did ask for another piece of toast and the manager came to the table and declined my request stating it’s against the policy and flatly denied me. Her English wasn’t great but rather than making a fuss I just left it at that. After showering and getting ready to leave we were interrupted by a knock on the door, it was thr manger again saying they their state of the art technology states we are smoking in the room. Funny thing is neither of us do and we were quizzed for five minutes about this we were given a filthy look upon departure. Make your own mind up about this place. It’s absolutely disgusting in our opinion",2.0,2.0,0,1
352,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,4,Discriminating behaviour towards my little girl by a lady staff member named HAYLEIGH at Butlins Bognor Regis Resort,"On our 2nd night at the resort, we attended a family event at the Reds venue where we had a very nasty experience with a red coat staff member named HAYLEIGH. She singled out my 5 yr old girl and stopped ONLY her from taking a picture with the Mr. Potato head character.
When I saw my little girl close to tears I approached HAYLEIGH and requested politely to grant her just one picture as she was the last child in line. I would have understand if there were more children behind her and all asked to leave but to ask just the last child out??? I was told rudely by her that they had already done the countdown to end the photo shoot and that ‘ I should have used my ears to listen better’ !!!! She also said that instead of dancing with my little son on the dance floor,I should have ‘paid more attention to the queue’.
I was extremely shocked at her condemning manner and reminded her that after the countdown five other white families had stood in the queue in front of my girl and had been granted a picture and why was she, the only one to be left out? Also, what does me dancing with my son have anything to do with my daughter who was waiting her turn patiently in the queue????
What is worse is that my daughter had only joined the queue (after the countdown) once I checked with the male photographer there. He later denied any responsibility saying that he was just there to take pictures! When I reminded HAYLEIGH that such an attitude towards a guest and a child was not acceptable, she very arrogantly pointed to her name tag and asked me to report to whoever I liked, it made no difference to her! She spent about 2-3 mins arguing with me and the Mr Potato head character remained in the background but she couldn’t use a minute of that time to make a little girl happy????

We have been to many other family resorts and have never experienced anything like this. In fact, most other places go out of their way to make the little ones feel special. We were initially very impressed by the Butlins resort, the ocean hotel room, the pool zone and entertainment shows where we did see friendly and attentive staff like the hotel receptionist Kirstie and most staff at the pavilion arcade. I am surprised that someone like this lady Hayleigh works in a resort of this stature as she definitely has a problem with brown/dark skin and clearly does not know how to communicate with guests.
I strongly condemn such obnoxious and discriminating behaviour in a place that claims to be dedicated to families and fun. As parents we did not spend our hard earned money, for our daughter to feel inadequate and reduced to tears just before her birthday! (she didn’t want to attend most character events at the resort after that). We checked out of the resort a day earlier than needed and must say that we have been extremely disappointed by Butlins on this occasion.

He had booked a superior room and for once, this was exactly what we got-four poster, sofa and chairs, massive bathroom with a TV! Just a fabulous place to stay and recharge your batteries. All the staff were very pleasant and helpful,especially the lady in the dining area.

Secondly at 8:00 in the morning a member staff tried to enter our room without knocking or making themselves present. Luckily we had the latch across the door. In result of this we was fully awake and was at unease.

387,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,14,Property stolen from our room,"Stayed here 8th - 12th July 2019. This is the second year we have visited the resort. The rooms are in desparate need of a refresh but the new pool was great and that is what we have given the 1 star for. The reason for my negative review is the customer service we received after we left. Our 1 year old was sick so we rushed home and left 1 bag of our items in the electric cupboard. So as soon as we realised I attempted to call guest services. This alone took over 48 hours to get through to them. Finally I have spoken to 3 different people and was promised a call back by 12 noon once the cleaners had checked the cupboard for me. 12noon comes no call so I asked the lady when I can expect a call or call back myself. She then told me 4pm but this is when the new guests check in surely the room could be checked at 11am when the previous guests left or whilst they were there give them a curtesy knock to ask to check the electric cupboard? So I call back at 2pm to find out that our stuff has indeed been stolen which amounts to just over £300 plus a bank card. So disappointing as should this have been dealt with promtly and efficiently we could have got our stuff back. Will not reccomend butlins to anyone nor book another holiday with them.

329,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,184,Honest review as always,"I’ve stayed here many times and never had a bad experience, I’ve stayed in every type of accommodation and over the years eaten in every food outlet, every room I’ve stayed in has been immaculate and all the team in whatever department are smiling, helpful and friendly.
Of course people will find fault but often this is easily resolved by asking for help and not taking to social media to give negative reviews.
Yes silver accommodation isn’t as luxury as the Wave hotel but you know that before you book and by the price.
There’s always early bird booking on resort offers and this week there’s 40% off next year!
The shows are world class for a resort like this and the Funfair is always great I love the hook a duck with great team, loads of different colored ducks and so many prizes to choose from for our 3 year old.
There can be up to 5000 people on this resort at any one time so things can go wrong but in our experience if you have a genuine grievance they will go way beyond what’s deemed as fair to rectify it.
The new splash pool is fabulous obviously it’s not for Olympic swimmers it’s just as it should be ‘family orientated’.
We’re here now for Halloween and it’s been themed and the face painting stall do some fabulous scary faces. We’re back for Christmas when once again it’s themed and fake snow everywhere. Thank you Butlins we love you.

361,Church Farm,Accommodation,Littlehampton,AccomOther,81,An excellent stay!,"Just got back from a lovely stay at Church Farm. From the moment we arrived, Ray in the gate shook our hands and directed us in. We were far too early to check in, but the facilities were available to us.
As the weather was good we decided to explore a little. The nearby coast is completely pebbled, you can get to it in a variety of ways, the staff can help direct you. We sat on the stones for an hour before walking through a residential area. Here you'll find amusements, cafe, chippy and a pub. There is one on the front, but it's members only.
Back at the resort the mash and barrel bar is quite large. There's an outdoor bit with a park for the kids crazy golf etc. There's an outdoor pool, but it was shut. Drinks prices are reasonable, there are a number of TVs in the bar, these showed sport all week, mainly the football. There's a couple of pool tables and a dart board.
The show room is where the activities like the bingo take place, the usual story of louder music and kids running about. The staff there are great with the kids as far as we could see.
We used the pool at one point, it looked clean and well organised but it isn't that big and filled up quickly. The slide is good fun!
They offer loads of activities but there is a charge; £10 for archery, segue etc. It's a pity some of these weren't free, it could get expensive. There are free ones I think though.
The caravan itself was great. We went for a comfort plus caravan, and it was spacious, clean and warm when the weather turned thanks to the radiators. It was spotless when we arrived and very hospitable.
At all times the staff were friendly and helpful; we really enjoyed our stay. It's close to Portsmouth one way and Brighton the other.

79,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,3,Very disappointing in all areas,"Took our granddaughter for a term time break at Bognor Butlins as we had done last year but this time it was quite awful and what a rip off! All the activities that 9 year olds enjoy came at an additional cost usually £8 each and that is just one turn on the zip wire which was over within seconds. The archery is over booked so you don’t get your own target but have to share so spend half the time standing around. However worse than that the evening entertainment is up stairs which is serviced by only one lift! Two out of the four nights we were there the lift was out of order meaning the person in our party with mobility difficulties could not attend, that is 50% of the promised entertainment not assessable. The same happened last year and we put it down to bad luck but two years running is just not acceptable.
The food is okay for mass production but the dining room tables are really squashed in making accessibility for wheelchairs very difficult and even doing that there are not enough at peak times and people often had to wait.
The new swimming pool disabled changing rooms were really dirty on all of the four days we used them. We used three different ones and each had terrible drainage problems. My granddaughter and I actually got locked in one of them when the handle stopped working inside. We were eventually let out by another guest after repeatedly banging on the door and shouting. We immediately informed the person on reception, who didn’t offer any apology but said they would deal with it. We watched and waited she didn’t move and we were concerned that no one else should have the experience that my husband found a lifeguard and explained again and he then locked the door. Once in the pool area there were no easy access steps or hoist to get in or out of the main pool from the wheel chair. My granddaughter throughly enjoyed the different pool areas and they were successful.
The fun fair is diminishing too with two adult rides missing from last year only one of which has been replaced but with a children’s ride.
Definitely not the Butlins we’ve known before and loved but a Hugh expensive disappointing experience that we will not be repeating.

The meal deals were excellent so I would recommend them. So yes very enjoyable sleep. The cleaning issues were not bad they didn’t clean bath and when they changed the hand towels one had a hole in it. Yes the bath had rusty colour round the sides but that didn’t me also the toilet had pink paint don’t know why but still no issues. I don’t know why they didn’t change the bedding maybe as I am staying 3 nights they just tidied the cover but not changed them for the whole stay. So yes I would recommend this premier inn and recommend the meal deal at the beefeater the onsite restaurant as the food was excellent just managed to have 3 full English breakfasts.

They were also able to accommodate the last minute change of us having to bring our small dog.

We had stayed at the Inglenook several times in many years ago and always enjoyed our time there. If anything the hotel has improved.

The room was small but immaculately clean with everything you would need. There is a basic but satisfying choice of cereals and yogurts, jams and marmalade and juices. The cooked breakfast options were plentiful, very well prepared and used top quality ingredients.

We did not eat in the restaurant on this occasion but it was always busy and the menu and specials looked wonderful. The Sunday lunch carvery look particularly delicious.

The bar was relaxed and friendly with an impressive variety of beers, ciders and specialised spirits. Despite the intermittent weather we were able to enjoy a couple of hours in the wonderfully maintained garden. It is easy to understand why this is a popular venue for functions

What impressed us most was the service and attention to detail, nothing was too much trouble. Service delivered by a team that enjoy what they do and with a pride that can only come from a truly independent hotel.

Then when my friend and I got changed to use the swimming pool couldn't use it as there was aqua swim fitness class going on in the pool. So we sat in the room to chill, there seemed to be lots of people in the room chillin. We then had to chose what time to have lunch and our beauty treatments were 2pm and 3pm, so that day we couldn't even use the pool. We had also been told by other people in the room that you had to get changed back into your clothes to eat lunch? We had to keep asking about everything which seemed that there was no organisation. What was really disappointing was that this was our 40th Birthday celebrations. The only thing that was good was the beautian she really made the afternoon with a relaxing back massage and a relaxing facial. Thank you.

Some deco work is needed but we could see that painters were busy working away refreshing rooms - upkeep of a hotel is an endless job but the good thing was that you could see that they were working on this.

340,Church Farm,Accommodation,Littlehampton,AccomOther,53,Nostalgic trip back to Church Farm,"We came here on the Sun Newspaper £9.50 holidays and I chose Church Farm as I had many holidays and happy memories coming here every year as a child before Haven took it over so it was a real nostalgic experience.
We were greeted by Ray who is on the security gate as you enter, very nice chap who made us very welcome. The check in staff were very professional and polite.
When I booked the holiday I upgraded to a comfort plus caravan and we were extremely happy with it as it had multi room heating, as the weather was very cold this was a bonus. We were in Ballast Rise which isn’t too far away from the entertainment and swimming pool etc so it was a nice short walk to get there.
Our only gripe when we entered the van was that the cleaners hadn’t hoovered the floor and dining benches and they were covered in bread crumbs.
We were given a three bedded caravan and this was very welcome as when we hired a high chair for my friends little toddler the very helpful chap that bought it along didn’t hesitate when I asked if he could move the single beds in one of the rooms so we could place the travel cot in there.
You will need to bring your own cleaning products i.e washing up liquid, washing up sponges and tea towels and oven gloves. There’s lots of cutlery, utensils and crockery supplied though. Nice big TV too.
The park is very well maintained, we loved the indoor swimming pool, the amusement arcade and soft play area was such fun for the little one. There is a restaurant called Mash and Barrel which we ate in one afternoon, the food was really good. There is a shop on site too, but further down the road is a local Tesco express and near the seafront is a CoOp.
We also used the local Chinese takeaway along the road just about a one minute drive from the site called Jasmines, very good food.
We will definitely come here again and looking forward to next time.

56,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,39,Avoid Ocean Hotel,"I’ve left a full review of the hotel on the hotels page, but let’s just say we were less then happy with the noisy doors, light switches, lifts, and neighbouring guests. It totally ruined our holiday from the first night, with noises into the early morning, all 5 of us were kept up and I personally did get a wink of sleep, I’m so disappointed with butlins ocean hotel, the design of the rooms, corridors, the actual doors and the sound proofing.

We have visited butlins every year for 4 years, the wave hotel is so much better for noise and layout. But this year also saw a huge influx of lower end clientele, unfortunately I would call them chavs, I understand that this isn’t butlins fault, but it’s a fact. These guests are load and anti social, we will be taking our money elsewhere from now on.

The plus side is every single member of staff on that resort is a credit to the organisation, so friendly, so up beat and just fantastic, shame about the room and guests.

111,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,60,Lovely Location - Tatty Hotel,"Where to begin – this is definitely not the standard of hotel synonymous with the Hilton Brand, in my opinion it is the worst Hilton I have stayed in to date! The hotel is in desperate need of a major refurb, the creaking floorboards threadbare carpets and scruffy walls in the corridors are very off putting. The building itself is charming and with some serious investment it could be a lovely venue. Our room had recently been painted and although small was generally clean – I did, however make the mistake of looking out of the window to find that the windowsill was filthy and covered in dust & cobwebs – which was a shame as the rest of the room was fine. There are also no lifts available so if you have mobility issues be sure to request a room on the ground floor. There was no air-con in our room, although there was a very noisy metal fan supplied, so it was a toss up as to whether the heat or the noise kept you awake at night. The reception staff on check in were very helpful and efficient – not so good on check-out (different staff) who seemed to be struggling with the busy period. We also found the bar staff to be very helpful and friendly – but the drinks are over priced – £12.50 for a large glass of Sauvignon Blanc! The biggest shambles was definitely breakfast time – we headed down at 08.45 and there was a very long queue, we were eventually seated at a table – only to be moved on by a very angry customer when he returned from fetching his breakfast a few minutes later – so back to the desk to wait for another available table, without so much as an apology from the lady who sat us down in the first place! It was a very hit and miss affair with some tables being offered teas & coffees and others being left to fend for themselves. Admittedly it was a very busy breakfast session, but the wait for certain hot items (eggs/bacon/sausages) was ridiculously long, the remaining items were congealing on your plate before the stocks were replenished, and when I asked a member of staff how much longer the wait would be, I was informed by her that it wasn’t her department so I would just have to wait as one of her colleagues would deal with it! After a wait of over 45 minutes (from initially queuing) we decided that enough was enough, and left without bothering. We would have complained there and then but couldn't find anyone to complain to - and after the attitude of the member of staff we did talk to anout the food issues, we thought we'd be wasting our breath anyway. This Hilton was terrible value for money, and to be honest I have stayed in better budget hotels, definitely one I will avoid in future!

246,Swan Hotel,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,2,The Swan Hotel Arundel,"I made contact with the hotel on various occasions through messenger on booking.com explaining that this was a very special double celebration for my husband and I. I asked there advice on a tranquil spacious comfortable room with a view. I was told I had a super room selected for us for all of the above reasons I stated. (paid a premium rate)
I booked a table in the restaurant and was really looking forward to a relaxing weekend.
When we where taken to our room it was a bit impersonal bare floors, no rugs and a few curly hairs in the shower to greet us....
The music in the bar below was loud but I guessed it was at least going to end at 11.30-12. It did BUT then at 7.30 am Sunday morning it kicked off again! I tried contacting reception no one answered! They probably couldn’t hear it ringing!!!!
I messaged them through booking.com no one replied! I even rang the hotel from my mobile and no one answered.
An hour later after we where wide awake the music eventually got turned down but by then we where up!
The food in the restaurant was good, the service was slow due to large Christmas party bookings apparently.
Such a shame sadly won’t be returning!

137,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,118,Hotel tarnishes the Hilton brand,"We stayed here for one night. The Hilton group offers a middle of the road standard. Being an old manor, we thought Avisford Park might in fact offer a little more appeal than usual. Unfortunately we were disappointed. This hotel looks so tired and is in desperate need of an upgrade and modernisation. Carpets are worn, walls are scuffed, the beds are very hard and it really is not a four star hotel.
Our room was large and airy but it was old fashioned - in a bad way - no character here. The bathroom was very dated.
Although the food served at breakfast was satisfactory, service at breakfast was poor and the young staff need some training. It was all very basic.
How can this be a Hilton? We will bypass it next time if we are ever in the area again. There are plenty of other nice hotels in the area to choose from.

It’s a very slick operation. Well organised, great entertainment, a wonderful new, swimming complex, lovely accommodation and so much to do. The beach side resort is well looked after and maintained, with beautiful gardens and a range of accommodation to choose from. There are many good cafes and restaurants to eat at, both in the resort and the main town.

We stayed in the Seaside apartments and although we didn’t have a balcony as promised, we were very happy with our choice. Designed in a kitsch, seaside theme, it was welcoming and functional.

What a brilliant week we all had! Billy Butlin would be proud of his legacy.

The room was spacious, absolutely spotless and the communal areas were also very clean and the reception well stocked with extra milk, tea, coffee etc. The asset of this place is the staff. They couldn't do enough. James, whom I met at reception when I arrived me in the evening was professional, friendly and helpful. He treated me as if I was staying in a five star hotel. The lady in the morning was so professional and kind when she reassured me that it was ok to check after 12:00.

0,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,17,Very disappointing,"We Arrived May half term with my two children aged 11 & 8 to a “New Style Silver Apartment”. This holiday included no meal plans, no additional extras and cost me a few pound shy of £1000. The website explains you can enter the park from 1pm but cannot access your room/apartment until 4pm. We went to our apartment at 4:30 and the cleaners were still in our rooms cleaning. We were self catering so had to ask to put our food we had bought into the fridge, the cleaners allowed us to do this but not without a look of disgust. The apartment was still dirty even after they had left, windows had lipstick on them, glitter all over the chairs dust on the radiators, scum on the backs of the bathroom doors and chunk of plaster missing from one of the door frames. The kitchen was not well equipped; no frying pan, limited kitchen utensils, a tea towel thinner than a muslin, and bowls that were greasy. We had to ask for another towel, the vague looking guest services employee and explained she’d get one to us that afternoon...it never came.

The apartment is ‘rough’ looking, very small, dark and depressing. They’ve crammed bunk beds into one room so that not even the door will open. They’re old apartments attempting to look new but unfortunately failed.

The swimming pool was the BIGGEST let down. It was freezing. It’s newly refurbished and looks fantastic, but the pool temperature is unbearable. The que for some of the slides varied between 30-60minutes. The pool is open to the general public so it gets ridiculously busy and unfortunately for those who have paid for a £1000 holiday have to suffer the consequences. The changing rooms were filthy; the floors covered in mud.

The entertainment in the evening was ok however people using mobility scooters would often block entrances, doorways and fire doors to park them. I don’t believe there are any parking facilities for these. When we asked a member of staff to move the scooters from a fire door he explained “it was not his responsibility”. This was the last straw in an already horrible holiday.

I’d decided on a Butlins break this year instead of a holiday abroad. I thought it would be easier for my family and also saved some pennies. I wish we hadn’t have bothered.

I feel let down, exploited and sad for my family and especially my children. It was a horrible holiday, please don’t waste your money guys, go abroad, Centre parcs, haven...any. Please don’t give your hard earned money to this cruddy establishment.

Now we shared a room in the wave hotel which looked nice but there was some loud children nearby which disturbed me and rob later when we was having fun but they got a sight they can never take back! The food was not to bad but there was the occasional imbosile around causing hassle to Rob however it was not to bad apart from the diner - took to long and did not allow us to enter with some hungry kids which we wanted to feed! The Rides were appalling to say the least, we tried to get onto the bumper cars together but they said ""not even one of you could fit in one"", very offensive and in general very disheartening. There was a statue of Billy Butlin and all the youngsters of the modern age were chanting ""willy butlin"" - how immature.

I was concerned it wouldn't feel like Christmas but no chance of that happening! Everyone makes a huge effort there to keep the Christmas spirit going the whole time and the extras like the selection boxes, reindeer food and table cloth and crackers in the room were just so lovely.

We stayed in one of the oyster bay apartments which is totally adequate for us, there was 5 of us (2 adults, 2 teenagers and 2 year old) so we had three bedrooms and plenty of space. It's not the Ritz but I didn't pay for that so dont expect it! Was comfortable and clean. The showers are very small but we all managed just fine.

The shows were brilliant, especially the panto on boxing day and we love the new pool!

1,Norfolk Arms,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,19,"Friendly staff, clean rooms, breakfast needs some work","The Norfolk Arms is perfectly situated within reach of just about everything in Arundel. The staff there couldn't be more friendly, welcoming and accommodating. My room, a single, was clean and well appointed, although the pillows were rather uncomfortable - one was very thin and they were both a bit hard. A fan had thoughtfully been provided to deal with the extremely hot weather. The problem with the breakfast was that the ""vegetarian sausage"" was in fact a roll of mashed potato and carrot pieces, rather than a Quorn or soya or even seitan substitute. As the vegetarian breakfast came with hash browns but only one poached egg, this made it very potato-heavy and protein-light. (The standard ""full English"" has both sausages and bacon.) The young serving staff at breakfast were very pleasant and helpful.

29,Foxwood ,Accommodation,Arundel,AccomOther,354,Fantastic but one negative.,"We stayed as a family of 4 in August 2019.

Check in was super quick and easy and our pitch was huge and easy to get our stuff to with the provided whellbarrows. The chap who checked us in was super helpful and a real example as to what hospitality should be. This pitch was on the right as you go down the track and as far back as you can go from the kids rope swing.

We truly loved almost everything about this site, clean showers, nice and quiet neighbours and all the other plus points previously mentioned in others posts.. But! There is considerable road noise.! We arrived on a Sunday and there is a race track not far away that didn't help but I think the bulk of what we were listening to was motor bikes on the A27?

It did quieten down pm but it woke me about 5am the following day. It sounds odd but if you pitch to the left of the path, closer to the road, it is quieter due I think to a hill that deflects the road noise.

Would I go back? Yip absolutely but I'd take an ear plug.

351,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,3,"""carefully curated to fit in with your tot’s routine"" - yeah right","We took our 18 month year old daughter to Butlins last weekend. It was booked as a JUST FOR TOTS weekend, which was advertised as being 'carefully curated to fit a tot's routine', and that there was no need to worry. It was set up to allow for 'enjoying quality time with your mini-me's'.

On paper, this seemed to be true. Amazing acts such as the Teletubbies during the day and Justin Fletcher in the evening which our little one loves made it seem like a no brainer. We took up a variety of offers and ended up with a 'sort out your own food but everything else is covered' total of around £450.

When we got there, the weather was a bit lousy. No one can do much about that. The staff as we entered the parking were happy and helpful, as were the staff on reception who let us know about the activities on whilst we were there. This was when we were told that even though Justin had a couple of shows on, we HAD to take the 7 o'clock showing - which is normally bed time for our little one so already not QUITE fitting our routine... but it was a holiday so we let that slide.

We then proceeded to our Seaside Apartments which we had paid extra for as they were sold as ""Perfect for families"". What they don't tell you is to enter the apartments (if you don't have a ground floor one), you first have to go up a metal spiralling fire escape to get to your floor. We looked around and saw countless families struggling to the 1st and 2nd floors with kids under arms, prams, suitcases and more. Not what I could ever describe as kid-friendly, and more than that what I WOULD describe as unsafe. Due to the bad weather these metal steps were really slippy and at several times over the holiday we had some near slips - particularly when bringing the heavier luggage/prams in and out of the apartment.

Inside the apartment itself was of OK quality, and the living room was comfy. The twin bedroom which we'd specifically booked for a travel cot however was not big enough for one. We ended up having to completely re-arrange all the furniture in there ourselves including stacking some bedside tables to make JUST enough room for the cot.

We also unfortunately were unable to find a room with a bath and there was only a shower - although we were told toddler baths were available to rent from Butlins when we got there. When we went to enquire about this however we were told these were more for tiny babies and would not fit our 18 mo. Therefore an awkward standing-in-the-shower-clutching-the-little-one was needed.

We had arrived on a Friday and saw there was a showing of the Teletubbies in the pavillion starting in 45 minutes - not many people had turned up to the resort for the weekend yet so we strolled down and it seemed relatively quiet... until we got to the central stage. Parents and their children including prams, bags and all sorts had already crowded the front of the stage and meant that our 18 mo had to stand with us at the back near the cafe. This was 45 minutes until anything else happened on the stage - there was no pre-entertainment to entertain the under 5s. If you have a little one of this age you might well know that keeping their attention for this long is near impossible and often results in a cranky child by the time the fun started.

We hoped this was just a one off, but unfortunately this was just the beginning of a heap of problems for us.

The next morning we were up and out of the room just before 9 and had read there was a Toddlers Relaxing swimming session where in the brochure it stated slides etc would be turned off so it was as relaxing for young children as possible.

However when we arrived we were greeted to a huge queue where someone near the front told us they had been waiting 45 minutes as they were operating a one-in-one-out process to get families in to the pool. There was a viewing window of the pool and it looked like a scene from 28 days later there were hoards of people. Parents were forced to congregate standing at the sides of the pool whilst their kids got to put their feet in, but more than that, all of the slides etc were fully operational meaning 4-5 year olds were running up and down and making it extremely difficult for families with smaller children to enjoy themselves. Because of this we bailed on the idea and left the swimming pool.

There were some elements of the pavilion that did operate well. The small rides behind the main stage such as the mini rollercoaster etc had quick queues and the staff did well to always ensure kids were strapped in properly. We ended up spending a good amount of time on here.

We attempted to get in to the soft play area too. As my daughter is only small we were restricted to the left half of the soft play specifically reserved for small children. However this part of the soft play had no ramps, or even steps. The only way to the upper level was through some holes leading to higher up shelves. This was NOT something that most 2 year olds were able to climb on their own, so parents were all heading up it as well to help. However this meant there was a huge blockage of kids ascending/descending down the one way up or down (apart from a slide) and it genuinely took us 25 minutes just to get up the first part of the soft play. Once up it was one level with a slide but also some steep drops that weren't safe for young kids anyway. We went down the slide and left the soft play too.

I understand some people may read this and think I'm moaning but this was for us, an expensive holiday, which we only took up because it was advertised as being a stress free curated holiday built around toddlers. Our daughter spent a huge amount of this trip agitated at having to wait in queues and not understanding she couldn't just run off as we'd lose our place for certain things.

The worst of this was of course the main event of Justin. As already mentioned we had the 7 o'clock showing allocated to us. On the back of the ticket it noted that doors opened from 6 o'clock. It also stated very clearly there would be no queue jumping (even to the point they wouldn't allow someone else in your family to hold a place for the others). But how bad could the queue be? We were in the pavilion at 4.30... and the queue started. These earlybirds were ready to wait in a queue for 1 and a half hours to secure a seat... and then wait an additional hour sat on a chair with no stage entertainment and keep their kids busy. This might be possible with a 4/5 year old you can pass an iPad to, but not with an 18mo. There was no way we could possibly queue for that sort of time with her, and instead we got to the queue at about 5.55. The queue was built up half way around the pavilion and security staff were having to traffic people the right way. We were surrounded with parents holding squirming kids and often having to chase after them, come back to the queue and explain they weren't queue jumping.

We eventually got in at about 6.20 - 40 minutes before the show was due to start. ALL the front seating area was full. Staff were on hand to direct you to empty seats but naturally these were all at the back, and the ones we were sent to were situated behind a huge pillar. We could just make out the stage and as this was meant to be a fun interactive sing/dance along experience for my daughter I was gutted that we were doing it from practically the back of the room.

A crowd next to us had 'reserved' a long string of seating for their friends by putting bags/coats on them and refused to relinquish any for our daughter to be able to see the stage without constantly switching from either side when Justin went behind the pillar in our way.

The actual show was good - and I don't want any of this to come down to Justin's performance, or even the staff at the event. They were genuinely nice and tried to help.

However the overall organisation and I suppose sheer number of people they had crammed in was out of control. It meant that a good 50% of people in there were not getting the experience they wanted. Which may have been alright for the group of wasted dads sat next to us who weren't even facing the stage, but for us who had come specifically for our daughter, it was tragic.

On Sunday, we made the decision that this had been a disaster. Everyone was tired and cranky, especially my daughter, and we came home over a day earlier than we should have done.

I've never left a holiday early before, and I've definitely never felt relieved to be leaving one. But on this occasion it was the right thing to do. Unless something fundamental was to change in the way these weekends are booked/managed I don't think we will ever be coming back.

The clothes airer was broken, the window latch was barely on and the toilet only flushed after about 10 goes. We paid almost 1000 for fri to mon and I feel robbed. Ocean drive was where we ate and although there was enough of a choice the food was cold. I witnessed various people hit there head on the balcony as it's very low down at the top of stairs. Unless your under 5'6 you better hope for a ground floor. Much preferred the old pool. New one is more for toddlers I feel and my 8 year old got bored very quickly.

Sadly, this time we had hot water problems. Warm tepid water was all we could get from the taps. After 4 visits from the on-site plumbers and eventually being told to run off gallons of water to get the water hot didn't really work. The bath water remained warm and the basin tap never really got to warm. One should not have to complain to Reception so many times. On the penultimate day the Shower would not work at all - absolutely no water hot or cold!! Strangely on the last morning (Monday) as we were ready to leave we got hot water out of the bath tap - phew, what a mess!
As we left we did stop to update Reception and they kindly offered to discount our next years stay.
The 70's music was a bit naff this year - no big singer or band. As for having two Comedians on the bill .... well that seemed a bit daft. It was after all a musical weekend. More cost cutting it seems. We noticed several areas where facilities were not up to standard. Hopefully this is just a momentary lapse and things will return to the good old days!

The hotel is near to Arundel and has extensive grounds.

Our room was well equipped but had an extremely noisy creaky floor!

We had several meals during our stay. There was a good selection of typical hot and cold options for breakfast.

However both our evening meals were unacceptable, and lacking In flavour, with over cooked or under cooked elements and the service was extremely slow.

Friday’s buffet was absolutely awful, watery bland ‘curry’, pasta, ‘stroganoff’ and the most basic of salad options and deserts.

Last night’s dinner service took over 3 hours as there were very long waits in between courses so we finished at 2240!! This meant that we lost an hour of our entertainment leaving guests disappointed!

The hotel doesn’t have any lifts which made it difficult with our luggage as we were on the second floor with a lengthy walk to our room (far from ideal for anyone elderly or with health issues).

Several areas are looking rather shabby with maintenance needed, new carpet, paint etc.

The staff were very polite and helpful throughout our stay but clearly just could not cope - there just weren’t enough on duty.

All in all we did not get the standard of stay you would expect of a 4 star hotel so feel disappointed.

224,Rustington Manor,Accommodation,Littlehampton,Hotel,1,NOT fine dining AVOID AVOID AVOID,"We dined here 4 weeks ago on a Saturday evening.
The menu consisted of a variety of 5 choices of meals one being veggie so we both like meat so this was reduced to 4 meals! The waiter then told us that the fish dish was not available!! down to 3 choices now and that there was no more rump steak but we could have Sirloin.
Well better cut of meat so that is what we ordered.
This was the toughest piece of meat we have had and a total waste of money.
ALL there meals come with chips, (ALL OF 5 when available) and they call it this FINE DINING!!
We decline having deserts or coffee but the waiter insisted we spoke to the manager.
The manager was called and I asked about the wording of 'FINE DINING' he said they was going to remove that and offer a new menu which would be in 2 weeks and took our number and said he would phone us when this NEW menu was available for us to sample free of charge as a gesture of good will as our evening had been spoilt.
The venue is pleasant, and apart from us there was 6 other people??? on a Saturday night speaks volumes.
The Lamb pub is very close with far better menu and far better quality food

190,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,10,Poor,"The new Splash pool changing rooms are absolutely disgusting. The floors are covered in gunk. There was a soiled nappy trapped between the baby changing unit and the wall in our changing unit - woman at front desk seemed utterly uninterested. I was expecting Splash to be something better than, or at least on a par with Centre Parcs - it is nowhere near that level. Woburn Forest which was opened 5 years before this over-hyped Butlins water park is just head and shoulders above it. Main buildings are very tired and worn looking. We had a photo shoot at Splash and after we had walked around the pool areas taking photos were told to return the next day, I explained the next day we would be about 200 miles away, and asked why I wasn't explained that beforehand, girl shrugged and said contact guest services. Went to guest services, closed. Phoned them the next day, then told to phone photo booth, several calls later was told I couldn't have them due to GDPR. Contacted customer service ... not interested in my issue, nor my time being wasted like this, and when I said that they should tell customers that if their photos were taken after 4pm, that they had to be in the resort in person the next day to collect them (ie not to waste our time as customers in a fruitless excercise), customer service respond, and I quote 'your comments regarding this being communicated to guests will be kept in mind for future discussions'. That they will only 'keep' this 'in mind' for 'future discussions' makes me think someone needs firing in their customer service department, and as for my wasted time just an empty word 'sorry', not even ""oh hey look you wasted part of your day and an hour or so trying to get your photos by contacting guest services, etc, as the girl advised you to do, here's a 5 pence voucher to buy a sweetie"". I got nothing for that, just ""Yeah, sorry about that"". If you think that is customer service, honestly you need to have a massive rethink.

143,Bailiffs Court,Accommodation,Littlehampton,Hotel,71,Amazing Experience,"We (3) went for afternoon tea (reservation recommended). The hotel is too beautiful to describe- so much history. Our server brought a tray of sandwiches, which included smoked salmon, cucumber, egg mayonnaise, ham and tomato. He also brought 2 tiers of cakes, which included scones, passion fruit mousse, cheese cake, chocolate gateau, almond and cherry cake, clotted cream, blackberry jam and lemon curd. A choice of tea or coffee.

The whole experience was absolutely amazing and our server certainly added to the experience. We only wish we asked his name.

For a starter I had calamari - the best I can remember - cooked in a light fresh batter. If you've been shunning this dish of late because it always tastes and feels like tough rubber, then please give it another chance here. It was faultless. To follow I chose the fish of the day - a fillet of sea bass. It was perfectly cooked and served on a bed of french beans and asparagus. Upon request a few saute potatoes were added to augment the dish. For pudding I had one of three homemade fruit pies on offer, served with ice cream or cream. To accompany the fish I had a glass of Sicilian dry white wine., which had lots of flavour and no harshness.
All-in-all it was a fabulous, tasty meal - leaving one feel nicely fed but not stuffed - and all for a very reasonable price. The quality of the cuisine could have come from a kitchen charging 50% more - if indeed you can find it.

We told her we knew what we wanted to order, a carvery, which in theory is quick because all the food is there ready... wrong, she said there is a system whereby they take tables to the carvery to be served so that there isn't a long queue, and it would take max 10 min. she got our drinks order and we waited 40 min, looking at them several times and asking twice. At one point we thought of leaving but every time she said you will be next.

414,BailiffsCourt Restaurant,Food,Littlehampton,Restaurant,36,Missed a trick,"Friends booked me and a friend a spa day for my birthday . Been before but not overally impressed and sadly after the day even less impressed, in fact we left early. I must just say though the massage I had was one of the best I’d ever had and was very good - but then it should be for the price.

The disappointing factors :
When we got there we asked to have something to eat .. like a brunch, sadly we were told they had nothing to offer us, we asked whether the hotel could provide us with a meal but sadly that wasn’t possible either ..
So my friend and I actually left the premises to go somewhere else for brunch. When we got back we got changed, changing rooms really pokey and smelling of old ladies rest home . Whilst poolside we were hoping someone would come past and offer us a refreshment or something as it was so hot in the pool area, but no staff members were making themselves available , just seemed to be lots of them congregated about at the reception area folding towels , in fact I didn’t see them do anything really other than fold towels unfold towels and fold towels again. Eventually I wandered into the reception area and asked for some drinks . After our treatments again we were offered no refreshments or drinks just put into a room with no one venturing in or out . A while later a friend came in to join us for afternoon tea , once again we found ourselves sat upstairs waiting for someone to come and take some orders, but again no one about , it seems if u want something u have to make your way down to reception each time.
 We were so disappointed we decided to just all leave and and cut our spa day short, and spend our money elsewhere.
 Personally i think it’s madness that bailiffscourt are so short sighted, anyone knows that food and beverage at such a place is your biggest money maker. Clearly they don’t need the business. Most odd. I won’t recommend a day spa. I’d rather drive an hour out of the way, and have better service. Thank you but it’s not for me.

Service was excellent, the young lady checked us regularly.

House wine was a sauvignon and crisp and refreshing. As good a house wine as I’ve had.

We where then able to sit there looking at our meals getting cold because they hadn’t brought any cutlery out. When they did, they hadn’t brought enough and had to go back to get more (we were a table of six, that’s not a high number to count to). The drinks then arrived and the waiter said “I’ll get you some different cups, these ones are dirty” (the cups he’d just brought out)!

We over heard another table complaining the drinks were taking a while. A suggestion to improve would be - if you’re having people order at the counter, make the drinks for them to take back out. Very common in a lot of places.

Apparently it’s what you do we were told from behind the pole, a fair distance away! To be reprimanded by the arrogant male bar tender & ridiculed by a group of young girls (who’s ID I hope were checked!), was embarrassing & totally unnecessary. My point to the management is simply this. If you wish your customers to form orderly queue at an empty bar some 8 feet away from the bar (especially when its empty)please make this clear by placing a sign for all newcomers like ourselves to avoid further unpleasant confrontations.

1008,Knights Table Steakhouse,Food,Arundel,Restaurant,17,FIRST AND LAST VISIT,"Booked via phone 31st Oct at 14.22pm for Sunday lunch on 3rd November, said we wanted the carvery and how much was it. Was told it was £14 and given the time of 2pm. At no time was I informed there was a ""carvery system"" and now wish I had looked on here and read Helen of Brighton's review of the 18th August. First off they said they could not find my reservation in the book then someone had a look and found it! Told them we wanted the carvery but waitress said she would put our name down for it?? meantime get our drinks. 30mins later still no news re carvery yet see people coming back with food from there (remember we did not know about the carvery system then), asked waitress again how long it was going to be and she said she did not know! Err what about going and finding out for the customer! I had not opened my bottle of drink and we decided to leave then without eating as could see this was going nowhere and it was getting late for lunch, went up to pay for partner's bottle of drink which had been opened and half-emptied (both soft drinks, not that that matters), they then tried to charge me for both, said I was not paying for mine as I had not opened it and had wanted it with my dinner which did not seem to be coming - we had pre-ordered carvery on the previous Thursday and no mention made of their carvery system to which man on duty at counter said he only works weekends! No appologies made whatsoever. This establishment might look the part, but needs vast improvement on customer service, safety, eye sight tests/reading classes and their so called carvery system (never ever come across this before) which I was informed was due to being in a small area with too many people going up and live flames of candles there ... HEALTH & SAFETY is this safe with young children around? Lit candles on all tables, as a family eatery would be safer for battery candles hence still look the part. Our table also was sticky - needs to be spray cleaned after every use, simply health and safety requirements. We really had been looking forward to this but still got our Sunday roast.... further down the road at the Swan... no ""carvery system"" there, and meal was delicious and cheaper! Even on an off busy day, no excuse for poor manners towards customers and have the courtsey to keep them informed especially of your so called ""carvery system"".",4.0,2.0,British,1

912,"The Windmill, Harvester",Food,Littlehampton,Pub/Bar,5,Absolute Shocker wish I’d read the reviews,"Waited 7 mins to be greeted. I don’t time these things but I was looking at the time on my phone when we got in there. Think about that. 7 minutes standing there hoping someone would at least give us a nod, let alone approach us with an 82yr old and 2 small overheating thirsty girls. Totally unacceptable and I should have left then but the girls were hungry and it was my 82yr old mums birthday. What a treat she got, not.

When the server finally came over she sternly asked if we’d booked (as though it was unlikely we’d get a place)? It was 5:45pm, hello.

The restaurant was half empty by the way so id dread to think what it’s like when it’s busy. Unless you have the patience of a saint id avoid this place. I’ve come here on and off for years when invited by others and although the food has improved, it’s more expensive than it used to be but there’s always a problem either with hygiene, sticky tables, rude staff (not today though, they just didn’t get near us), poor supply to the salad bar, etc.

30 mins after being seated we were given no salad bowls but more importantly we were parched but STILL NO drinks on the hottest day of the year, so no rehydrating my 4 and 6 yr old in sweltering heat. 30 minutes after ordering with not even the jug of water that we ordered is unacceptable in that heat. When I finally had enough I wandered up and got my own jug at the bar. Intriguingly it had a big bite mark chunk out the side of the skanky worn out water jug. It should have been in the bin. Oh and they don’t have any ice on the hottest day in summer!!! Basil Faulty runs this place, surely?

No tomatoes or cucumbers in the salad bar just a watery mess where they once lived. Loads of sauces to choose from but it was a lucky dip as none were labelled running the risk of giving your child chilli sauce instead of ketchup or relish.

We ate the cut-down salad off little side plates as nobody gave us bowls so we improvised with what was there. My mum only had salad bar as she’s elderly so her whole meal was on a tiny side plate! Disgraceful.

After being left to fend for ourselves I cleared the finished salad plates myself in the end and put them on the tray I got from the bar when I went to serve myself and my family that jug of water.

As a side note I took my little one to the men’s bathroom. She’s kicked off her sandals under the table in the heat but I hadn’t realised. She then walked into the toilet and walked in urine leaking from the urinals. They had put out of a sign to say wet floor but it was puddles of wee all over the bathroom everywhere so my little princess had walked through lots of pee to get from the cubicle to the sinks, the poor little mite. It should have been mopped up or locked up.

Nobody asked how the food was, we weren’t offered any more drinks (not that they arrive anyway) despite it being sweltering. We didn’t get spoken to by anyone in that whole time since ordering food and due to the continued lack of staff I eventually had to go up and stand at the tills and interrupt a member of staff in order to actually pay the bill and get the hell out of there.

I noticed on the wall above the till it said something like “remember, no more bad reviews like the one from D.L” with a big arrow pointing towards it or something similar so it’s not as if they don’t know they need to buck up their ideas. To be fair the 2 people I encountered at the till were kind and apologetic. I wasn’t one of their tables but you could see they were frustrated and working under pressure in what seemed like a sinking ship so I did have sympathy for them. Very poorly managed though I’m afraid and lots of customers looked disgruntled. More staff and someone in maintenance to sort the bathroom, ice machine, I’ve cream machine is what’s needed.

The simple food took 45 minutes to arrive which is way too long in a half empty restaurant. Other restaurants set your expectations if there’s a long wait over 20 mins.
The food itself was ok when it arrived but I just wanted to get out of there by that point. I’d have to be desperate to go back there

This wasn’t our first choice as we have a Papa Johns just up the road from us at home. I’ve never seen a Papa John’s with a dine in option which was nice as at first we kind of assumed it would be takeaway only.

I was pleasantly surprised. There was a buffet including pizza, pasta and salad or you could chose from the Papa Johns menu. My parents, my 22 month old son and I decided to chose from the menu. My son loves pizza so we knew he would love it and he proved us right by devouring the whole thing!
My dad has never really been a huge pizza fan, but like me, agreed that it was one of the nicest pizzas he’d had in a long time. He had a double cheese and double pepperoni pizza, my mum has a vegetarian pizza and I have a pizza with pepperoni and chicken and they were delicious. They arrived on these pizza tray things, were nice and hot and looked very appetising - a lot more appealing to the eye then how it would be in a box!

Having read recent reviews about the food and experience we were optimistic that we'd have a local restaurant to add to our regular places to go for a sunday lunch. Admittedly we hadn't booked, but our general experience with the local pubs is that you dont need to but you may need to wait for food which is totally fine with us.
We arrived at 1.15pm to find there were 2 tables with shade available in the garden. Brilliant! We went into the bar area to ask whether we could have a menu (there's only waitress service inside and not outside, which was fine) The young lady that was behind the bar had stated there would be a 30 minute wait for food which we had said was totally fine. We were happy to wait for food whilst we had drinks. If I'm honest the way she responded made us feel like we had put her nose out of joint that we'd even asked about food. She then repeated that there would be a 30 minute wait... to which I said that was fine. She seemed surprised it was ok. But in all honesty I was happy we had found somewhere that we could get a table at without booking. I asked my partner whether he picked up on the frostyness and he completely agreed. Anyway after shaking it off, we got our toddler settled into the high chair and chose our food. Only to find that when we then went back into the bar to order food and drinks that the young lady said we couldn't order until 30 minutes time! It is the most absurd thing I have ever heard in terms of a service!! I completely understand that you may need to wait after ordering.... but to have to wait to ORDER.... is baffling! She was so abrupt I was so taken back. The most frustrating part of this was that the manager was not interested in even facing us to speak to us. We were not worthy of her attention. In fact I'm not sure if anyone was. I am gutted because it has potential to be great. No matter how good food is, Service is key and there's no point having staff that dont have any customer service skills. I am disgusted at how we were spoken to.

The irony is that we headed up to the Village Inn, they were just as busy as the black horse. We got the last table in the garden, we ordered, the staff so friendly and our food was on the table all within 15 minutes.

I was part of a largish group, there was a few couples seated as well as a very large group of people who appeared to be known to the owners of the restaurant. From the moment we arrived there were children running around the restaurant (from the large group), we were all a little concerned with all the plates of hot food coming out of the kitchen, and to be honest you don’t expect that in a restaurant when trying to enjoy a meal out. We decided against starters so we were given complimentary nachos to nibble on while we waited for our mains, which was a lovely touch and quite tasty, although the cheese appeared to be like the sort you’d expect to come out of a squeezey bottle. The main course (I chose a burger and fries) was huge, far too much for myself, although I’m sure many would be able to finish it off, so great value for money. Unfortunately the burger itself was nothing particularly special, a few of us found the burger bottoms to be quite soggy and found that we had actually been eating the paper it was served on as that too became very soggy. The cheesy chips appeared to have the same squeezey cheese on. Overall I was a bit disappointed and probably won’t go back, maybe having another large table along with us was a factor, maybe it was just not to my taste. Sorry.",2.0,1.0,Other,1

67,The Town House,Food,Arundel,Restaurant,142,Well Worth The Wait,"It was my birthday so we decided to get the train to Arundel and just find a restaurant and have a meal. We had often spoken about going to the Town House but on the days we vistited, it was always the days the restaurant was closed. We were in luck this time and managed to walk in about a half an hour before last orders for lunch were taken. The welcome was warm and friendly and the menu and specials were explained (including the prices) which was very helpful. There were not too many diners which meant for a reasonably speedy service which was a real bonus in which is a busy town at the best of times. The food itself was excellent and we had no complaints whatsoever. Small squares of bread made at the restaurant were served with oil and balsamic while we waited for our meals.
This is now one of our ""must go again"" places to eat now on a special occasion. However, it's best to check their webpage for opening times and in the evenings you must make a reservation.

Noose was around to welcome us so we stood at the ‘wait here to be served’ sign like idiots and someone said ‘just sit down they are short staffed’. They did appear to be with only a young lad trying his best to serve a reasonably busy restaurant.

We ordered Steak Pie which came with kale and mash and it was delightful. Nice drink and reasonably prompt friendly service made it a great meal out.

AN American lady next to us, who seemed to have never had a pub pie before, was struggling with her pie ‘I’m having problems cutting it’ she told a randomly appearance of a waitress/manager who went off and replaced it promptly with a much better cooked pie. How it even got served I don’t know.

There were several items on the menu that were not available even though it was very early in the evening. The food service was very slow. We had to ask twice for a carafe if water and it finally arrived just as we were finishing our meals.

I suppose we should have complained at the time but we didn't get an awful lot of attention from the waiting staff who were obviously busy elsewhere. There seemed to be some regular customers getting much better service than us. It's unlikely we'll visit again but I don't expect they would care! One other problem we had was with toilet accessibility - mum couldn't actually get into one of the cubicles - she is blind and uses a stick and couldn't find a way to wriggle round the door - maybe we missed a disabled access loo as I notice another of your customers brings her mother in a wheelchair.",3.0,2.0,British,1

The restaurant is dirty. The salad cart was almost empty and completely tasteless! No rotisserie chicken on the menu as run out. My second choice of pork belly had also run out, the waitress Rosin couldn’t care at all, shrugged her shoulders and walked off. Never came back. We asked for the manager who was very friendly and said all the right things, we placed an order of drinks and never saw her again. Had to go to the bar to collect our drinks as 20 minutes had passed. The barman was too busy on his phone to sort the drinks order, didn’t even acknowledge us. The food was not that great and we had to send 1 plate back.
Basically this place is run by kids who have no customer skills whatsoever.
Harvester you should be ashamed of this restaurant.
I will never return to a harvester ever again.
As a local taxi driver I will be telling customers to avoid this place.

However my husband, who did not have a starter, struggled to eat all of his cutlets as he was quite hungry. He is not a “foodie” but even he said they were the worst cutlets he had ever eaten.

I made the booking weeks ago and followed it up with a visit to the restaurant two days before. My friend is partially sited so I wanted to ensure we had the table by the window where it was bright.

When we arrived, the table I requested was occupied. We were asked to sit in the middle of the room where it was dark and noisy to wait for the table to become available (why were they not sat at this table in the first place was beyond me?) The waitress came over to take our drink order, we were never asked at any point later in the evening if we would like another....We then ordered our starters and mains at the same time. Food was okay, not overly special, we have all ate far better Italian dishes elsewhere. My meal in particular was warm, not hot, so I found myself eating it quickly before it turned cold. The table was cleared and the dessert menu offered and that's where it ended. We were totally forgotten about. Part of the reason for choosing Mamma Mia was to try the homemade lemon cheesecake as this came highly recommended. We were going to order 4, at just under £20 so fairly highly priced. We waited... and we waited ... To add further insult a very large party of 20+ descended on the restaurant and the staff rallied round like they were celebrities. This was the final straw. I consider it unacceptable to wait in excess for half hour to take a dessert order, who knows how much longer we would have waited had we not requested the bill and left? Disappointed. Will neither return or recommend.

Cold bacon, over cooked cold sausages, scrambled eggs etc. No bubble and squeak, no poached eggs. All available food was put on to cold plates resulting in a very disappointing breakfast.

That evening we decided to try the evening menu, again the same as our local ""Premier Inn"", why oh why did we bother - we had booked a table for 7.30pm, went down at 7.30 to discover they had given our table away!! We took a table in the bar as offered without making any fuss, were handed menus and told of 2 items unavailable, Hubby made his choice - cod and chips and I made mine - chicken in a basket only to be told ""Oh sorry thats not available"" Made a 2nd choice ""Oh thats not available either"" - and my 3rd choice was unavailable too!! By this time I had lost the will to live and went for gammon roast, 2 very small slices of gammon 3 awful soft roast potatoes and mixed veg arrived with a yorkshire pudding you could have used as a ping pong bat!! NOT GOOD! My husbands fish was not much better, grey looking cod with soggy batter - the triple cooked chips were the only saving grace. I felt very sorry for our waitress as she knew it was not good - she offered us free desserts which we accepted as we were starving. Mine was delicious (chocolate and raspberry torte) my husbands vanilla ice cream was ok too!

Our actual Premier Inn room was lovely, clean tidy and as you would expect, but you really need to sort out the restaurant side of things - we were advised by the grumpy restaurant manager that the restaurant was a different business to the hotel, but in my eyes it is endorsed by Premier Inn and should be a much higher standard.

The soup was stringy and pretty poor.

Most the veg was good but the kale served with the roast was so chewy and actually inedible.

The Lamb shank was extremely tender, fell off the bone and was seriously good. Big hearty portions and generous with the gravy and Yorkshire puddings. I added an extra slice of beef as I was hungry and wanted more meat.

Unfortunately they’d run out of cauliflower cheese and pigs in blankets.

I didn’t try any dessert but the ones coming out looked good, I expect they’ll taste pretty good as well.

The decor has that traditional pub feel but it’s been done up really nice outside and the back patio is perfect for a sunny day. Plenty of parking and it’s a nice cosy sociable vibe with plenty of space.

As far as pubs go this is very good and I’d definitely return for food again.

I waited ten minutes, checked the app again “your pizza has arrived / enjoy your food”.

I was however in a holiday cottage and the address came up on the app when I put in the postcode. The store said they’d have our order with me shortly. I said that I didn’t want the order that had already been sent as it’d be stone cold. Good enough the store said they would cook fresh and re-send. An hour on from my preferred delivery time I called the branch again and spoke to someone else this time. The guy said the order was on its way. How long I asked as I had already been waiting almost an hour on from the original delivery time. The response was vague. I asked if they would take some money off our order due to the mess around. The guy on the phone put me on hold to check with his manager. After a VERY short wait, I was told no, because the driver tried to call me and there was no answer, they’d be no discount. The so called attempt to contact me was a blatant lie. My phone had a signal and maintained such for the two occasions I spoke to the branch. The order arrived a few minutes after the call. I was keen to send it back without payment, my husband however, decided to accept it and pay for it, with a tip! The driver that brought the redelivery said his colleague messed up, went to the wrong address and he knew our location as he’d delivered there before. The food was barely hot, thankfully I had the oven ticking over for an hour (just in case) so warmed it to an edible temperature.

I would also like to add that the branch was just over two miles away so it wasn’t as if we were in the back of beyond. Appalling customer service. I wouldn’t order from here again if you paid ME.

Thankfully my local branch of Domino’s is super reliable. Littlehampton could learn a thing or two from them and from your competitor; Pizza Hut for that matter, even they have a Speed Guarantee.

We were first in restaurant at 12.30 so order taken promptly by lovely girl. On a sunday its a 3 course set menu for £19.50pp. For starters we ordered the fried brie & chicken lollipops. Received within 10 mins. The lollipops were the 2 popcorn sized bites on a bone in breadcrumbs-well overcooked & 2 bites. For mains we ordered roast beef & lamb. The roast potatoes were rock hard you couldnt even cut with knife, the yorkie burnt & the veg had a funny taste & well over cooked. The beef was so fatty, grisly & you couldnt even cut through it so my cousin couldnt eat it so we told the waitress. She apologised & took our plates away, she offered us another dinner but we declined. We were then greeted by the owner who came up to our table placing his hands on it & in an agressive manner said ""i believe you have a problem with your food"". He was unprofessional, rude and basically said there was nothing wrong with potatoes they were crispy, (they were like rocks) the yorkie is how they come (burnt?) & he & the wife checked our plates & nothing wrong. (Would love to see them eat it) My cousin said sorry we beg to differ as she couldnt eat it & his responce was ""ive taken 10% off your bill"" & just walked away!!!! A true professional manager should have apologised,listened to his customers with empathy & should have not of charged us for 1 of the meals as not eaten-a measly £3.20 off total bill & the rudeness was unbelievable.

Called the restaurant to ask if we could have fresh ones that we could eat along with the mint sauce that you normally would get but didn’t receive. The man on the phone was very rude but said he would STRAIGHT away, however after 25 minutes the food still hadn’t arrived. So everyone else had cold food sat around waiting. Called to ask how long food would be and staff was so rude and told me to talk to the manager and manager was just as rude.

974,"The Windmill, Harvester",Food,Littlehampton,Pub/Bar,27,Take away very disappointing ,"Since we were unable to go out for a meal my sons decided to treat me to a Harvester take away for Father’s Day.

One of them placed the order online via the Harvester website at 7pm for collection at 9pm. One of my sons wanted the “Cowboy” burger but didn’t want bacon on it as he doesn’t eat pork, although you can “customise” your order there is no way to exclude an item, only change the sides. When confirming the order the site suggests phoning the restaurant if you want any changes. The site also advises that the details have been emailed.

After about 15 minutes I phoned the restaurant and said I wanted to modify an online takeaway order. The person who answered said he couldn’t find it on their system and since no email confirmation had been received yet I should call back when that had been received.

I rang back shortly after 8pm as I was concerned that we’d still not had email confirmation and since the phone wasn’t answered I left a voice message asking them to ring me.

Come time the order was due to be collected I was greeted well and the server went to bag up the order which only took a couple of minutes. I took the order home and my wife was dismayed to find that although she had ordered 2 jacket potatoes with her “Simply Chicken” these were not to be found but it appeared she had a portion of chips instead. She had also not received any gravy. Her vegetables were cold, not room temperature, actually cold.

We felt the portions were small considering the prices seemed pretty high.

We had ordered 4 desserts which were not to be found so I returned to the restaurant. The server (no name badge that I could see) was extremely apologetic and went to get the desserts.

The chef brought the desserts out and explained they need to be heated at home since if they were to heat them the plastic containers would melt. This should be made clear on the menu when ordering.

All the staff looked tired after what had probably been a long busy day but were still polite, helpful and friendly. That was the only redeeming feature as we felt the food was poor value and quality as was the accuracy of the order.

Over 4 hours later we still haven’t received a confirmation email or return phone call.

We were not charged this, we charged the normal rate per dish. When a member of our party asked about the bill, she was told “you didn’t ask for the deal so you got larger portions...” which is odd as no where on the menu does it state that if you opt for the deal you get smaller portions..

We have eaten there before and the portions are the same size deal
Or no deal, if they aren’t, surely you should state so on the menu?? Do not treat your local customers like tourists that you can rip off which is exactly what you thought we were.

924,Lemongrass Restaurant,Food,Littlehampton,Restaurant,1,Service horrific,"Visited last night for a celebratory meal. Service was dismissive and rushed. Very quickly we were asked to order and then twice after that, each time saying no we weren’t ready. Staff were hovering behind us it was clear they wanted us to order. Had chicken satay and dumplings to start. Chicken was ok but dumplings were the worst we’d ever had, hard and dry.
Starter plates were cleared and I still had food in my mouth eating. Was wondering what the rush was and then I realised, the other waitress was stood behind with our mains. Hated this as had no break in between starters and mains and again it was made apparent there was a rush.
I had ordered what was meant to be a very very mild curry. It still had chillies in and was too hot to eat. Maybe the reason for this was that the waitress wasn’t even making eye contact when taking our order and was in a rush?
One waitress asked why I hadn’t touched the curry and we explained it was too hot to eat more than a mouthful. Rather than helping she walked away?!!!
When our plates were cleared another waitress apologised and told us we wouldn’t be charged for it. Very kind and we did appreciate this. But she said to mention it earlier in the future and they could have changed my meal. (We had mentioned it earlier and this didn’t happen).
Bill came and there was an automatic 10% service charge on there. Something we would have refused to pay had they not taken the curry off in good gest.

Overall we were in and out in 1 hour, nearly £80 down. That is not what we expect when you save to go for a celebratory meal.

474,Fino,Food,Bognor,Restaurant,2,"Nice location, ambiance and service, acceptable food.","So 4 of use ate at Finos recently. We had the seafood platter to share for starters, and a crab bruschetta starter. For mains we had the crab risotto, a pizza, and the breaded chicken, with egg and chips. Desert just had one chocolate tart with the mascapone. Came to around 100 pounds with drinks.

Restaurant was really nice and clean, nice lighting and general ambiance. Toilets nice and clean and modern. Staff were friendly and nice. Trying to do a fair honest review so its actually meaningful and constructive.

Drinks order was done reasonably quickly. Took a perhaps a while to place our food order, not long enough that it was bad, but just a bit too long. After order was made food came out in good time, with about the right gap between starter and main.

Starter. The seafood platter, tasted reasonably good. Breaded whitebait, and calamari in a bowl with some tartar style source. It was ok. decent. the seafood perhaps lacked the wow factor, but it was not bad. tasted reasonably fresh. just needed perhaps some more flavours or choice of dips. the crab bruschetta. Was a bit disapointing. Again not really bad. But the bread (panninni or something) was just a bit soft and tasteless, the crab layer didnt really have much flavour, it was just a bit bland. Not like really tasty, hard to describe. but not bad. not unpleasent.

The mains. The pizza which was just cheese and tomato. The quality of the pizza base was nice, and sort of seemed like good fresh dough. the cheese and tomato sauce had a good fresh flavor. but it lacked real flavor beyond just tomato and cheese was generally a bit bland (not a major problem for the kids menu). Also the bottem of the pizza had little black bits on it. the base was not burnt, but it had little black bits from where it sat in the oven, and these sort of gave a strong bitter charcoal flavor which was the overwhelming taste.

The crab risotto. This looked good, the texture of the risotto was good. But it had a really strong, overpowering flavor of aniseed? or something like this, maybe fennel. First spoon you notice it and you can not really taste anything else. But it became a bit sickly quickly. Again its was not really bad. but it was not great.

The Bread crumb chicken with a fried egg on top and chips. The chicken tasted fresh, the bread crumbs were fresh, it was hand made. It was not dry. the bread crumbs where a little bit greasy. and theres was no other real flavour going on apart from the chicken. but I thought it was pretty good. Fried egg on top. Fine. chips were good too. It just felt a bit like the sort of thing I make at home, tasty but a bit bland perhaps. I also thought the truffle source was properly vile, so glad it was in a little jar on its own it would have ruined the meal. but everyone else thought it was delicious and stole it :) thats a personal taste thing i think.

Desert. The chochlate tarte with mascapone, with little chocholate sticks in it. the flavour was great. the nice creamy mascapone, with sweet chocolate sticks. However the chocolate tart was bullet hard, I literally could not break it with a ton of force, it was so tough and when it broke it would shatter and fly off the plate. perhaps needed more balance was a lot of mascapone with just a very thin tart. but it tasted really nice.

Thats it. Im trying to be really honest. Would we go back. Yes. I think the restaurant has good intentions and is trying to serve good food and it felt nice in there, and we had a good time. The food was hmm.. It was ""ok"" better than average restaurants in the area. But there were big flaws with the food. Proper ""foodies"" would have been upset by some of these mistakes.

15/ 4 we went for Sunday lunch. My husband chose sea bass with aranchini balls , which was the entire dish ! I would have thought it would have at least of included some veg or potatoes or both for £ 17 ! ( so consequently not very filling for a man on its own) (suggestion the waiting staff need to make you aware of this when taking your order) .

On the other hand I ordered the Sunday roast option ! steak and came with all trimming ‘s ..lots of food!! And cheaper!
All the front of house staff are very friendly and polite , excellent service Joe” front of house manager” who listened to our comments an some suggestions and promised to give some feedback to the management ..
overall .. lovely clean, comfortable and friendly place to eat out in Bognor Regis area .

142,The Fish Factory,Food,Littlehampton,Restaurant,6,Dreadful fried selection,"The service was interminably long but the waiter did apologise and said they were short of staff so that was accepted without complaint.

Also I appreciate it is wrong to judge a place on a single visit so allowances there too.

However the meal was the worst meal I have ever eaten - a platter of seafood - whitebait, scampi, calamari and ‘fish balls’.
Without thinking too deeply about it I ordered it with chips as well.

What arrived was a large plate of the items described and everything battered and fried plus a serving of very tired looking fried chips.
The mass of fried and battered items looked awful, was not that nice to eat and I left most fearing heartburn, indigestion and an upset stomach besides a calorie intake that should raise alarm bells.

Ok I was stupid ordering a completely ridiculous fried selection and badly balanced meal but it begs the question why was it on the menu in the first place?

I noted the remains of other similar ‘platters’ being left by other customers.
So nothing that could not be corrected by having menu selections that provided much more balanced and interesting courses rather than a awful unhealthy mass of fried food.",3.0,1.0,British,1

Not offered a table in the dining room, we where shown a made up table what looked like a large broom cupboard.

We sat down the only table in the room which is tatty and needs completely redecorating.

Then the food came out, dry flavour less sandwiches, the scones where dry and reheated, the cakes where boring with no imagination or flavour, we only saw our waitress once, not even when we left.

We have had cream teas in many places.

The only certainty was the beer was cold, which would normally be enough to satisfy me, not this time however.
I could understand, it being mother's day, if they were apologetic and extremely busy. But upon reflection, our surrounding tables received much better service. Why of which I could not tell you.

As it turned out the eggs were exactly on top of each other and l mistakenly said there was only one which prompted some indignant reaction anyway £1.50 for an extra egg was a bit steep l said.
So l didn't make my self very popular in contrast my Brighton cafe gives me an extra egg just because l am a regular and are so approachable.

Simple burger and fries at 14 pounds was excessive and badly prepared . overcooked skinny fries , Less than fresh bun and swamped in that pink mayonnaise that even the Burger Chains use more judiciously. The service whislt pleasant was slow although it was a very busy Saturday night. Still that in itself was easy to predict and staffing levels should have reflected this . Everything else was average or worse and the bill was an unpleasant reminder of how poor an overall experience it was . Beautifully situated it could be so much better .

The food was really nicely cooked and well presented. I did note that previous reviews had commented negatively regarding a well done steak, it could be argued that the cooking of said steak was not the fault of the chef, more so the customer who opted to cremate the steak in the first place..... just a thought.

Went early Friday evening and not over busy but most tables including ours were sticky and filthy. Most others had glasses on them and eventually a staff member thought to pick some glasses up but heaven forbid she could wipe the table at the same time like numerous bars around the country have mastered over the years. Unfortunately another customer then sees an empty free table and sits down and then realised it was dirty and sticky but no staff members to be seen as I suppose they had picked up some glasses so they could relax again and wait for more to appear. I note the management have made a previous comment that they are trying to get staff to wipe up. Please give them and apron with front pockets to carry a spray, cloth and wipes so they have no excuse not to think that if they pick up a glass they can clean at the same time so the next customer gets a seat at a clean table. Unfortunately the female staff member did her same nonchalant non caring practice at three different tables in 45 minutes between 6.30 and 7.15 last Friday. Shouldn’t be that hard to identify her??

887,Mustards,Food,Bognor,Restaurant,122,Pricing,"I did dine at Mustards earlier in the year and as with a lot of places in West Sussex in my opinion was fine without being anything approaching memorable.
However I had the set menu and I did at the time comment to my dinner companions as to how long they could keep it at the very good price level it was.
I was not going to write a review, and am still not going to. But would like to comment on the review about the set menu prices going up 12%. The reply by the owners was clear and distinct and put the case very well. However it did miss one very salient point that all restaurants, pubs etc have to cope with on top of rising food prices, utility prices, business rates etc. That is that we tend to forget, as it is included normally in the price in the UK that 20% of what you pay goes to the government in VAT. So if you have the set meal at £22.95 then £4.59 is going straight to the government. Yes you can claim VAT back but in the restaurant business very little ! am told. We have one of the highest VAT rates in Europe for hospitality.
I am not a regular visitor to Bognor Regis but one of the things that you do notice as opposed to some of the dare I say it 'posher' places is the lack of restaurant chains.
If you have independents whether they be restaurants, bars, pubs, cafes or any business you should use them or lose them!
Business is incredibly tough at the moment and if you still think Mars Bars are 10p or you can get a well cooked three course meal for less than £20 well you are about 10 years behind the times.

At this point I realised that they do not have a chef, but someone who honed his skills doing school dinners in the 70's.
The gravy on my partners beef was so thin, that they had tried to thicken it with tomato ketchup.

We had whitebait and camembert to start (shared) I haven't had whitebait for a long time (theme here isn't there lol) and had been fancying it for weeks. I wasn't disappointed.

My husband and I and 2 others had been there a couple of weeks before really enjoyed the food and thought it would be ideal for a group of us. Arrived and went in for drinks , got these apart from a couple and they said they would bring over to table. Poppadum's ordered and chutneys and they arrived. Then main meals ordered. One couple wanted onion bhajis for starter. We still hadn't the drinks previously ordered, I had to go to the bar and remind them and wait. Not ideal. However starter arrived and obviously there was a wait in between no an issue. Then two vegan meals came out with out rice but the girls started to eat as hungry. We waited and waited and eventually a prawn curry x 2 arrived still no rice or naan bread The curry was congealed around the edge implying that it had been microwaved, and hubbie was looking through and could only find 4 prawns not a lot between 2 of us. To this time others had still not received their meals then the sides came out in drips and drabs and the rice still hadn't arrived!! You can imagine by this time we were very disappointed a birthday celebration that it was supposed to be, degenerated into a farce. My son got extremely cross as did my husband and we complained fiercely. By this time we were so disgusted with the meal and the terrible service and fact it hadn't come on time or was hot we did not wish to continue . The manager Michael came out and apologized but did not offer for me to be replaced he then disappeared. Needless to say this all ruined our experience and we had felt embarrassed as we had recommended the restaurant to our family. The tension between us was extreme made worse by the fact we were hungry!!! Quite a while later Michael turned up with a bunch of flowers and a cake and said oh this was lucky I had these at the back Oh yes. I thought. SO VERY SADLY THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS UNPLEASANT AND I COULDNT UNDERSTAND WHY SO BAD.

286,Knights Table Steakhouse,Food,Arundel,Restaurant,32,Very Poor Carvery,"We went to the Knights Table for a family birthday lunch on Sunday. After reading the many excellent reviews we were really looking forward to a lovely meal in a relatively new restaurant in Arundel.

Unfortunately our experience didn’t match the reviews.

After ordering the carvery for all of us we were told by the waitress that there would be a little wait, about ten minutes, while the carvery was ‘freshened up’.

However when we reached the carvery we were greeted with beef that had literally been seared on the outside and was raw and very bloody, 2 chicken pieces that were so pale they also didn’t look cooked and gammon that was over cooked and incredibly fatty. With the benefit of hindsight we should have refused the carvery and ordered something else but stupidly not wishing to make a fuss we carried on with it. In reality the food should never have been offered to us. There were little veg, the carrots had almost run out, the Yorkshire puddings were cold and tasted like cardboard and the roast potatoes inedible.

Interestingly, soon after we had been served, the carvery food was cleared and replaced. Perhaps we chose the wrong time to eat but again we should never have been served such poor food.

When the waitress cleared our plates, saw how we had left most of our food and asked how our food was she said ‘thank you for being honest and we welcome feedback positive or negative’ but with respect these are clearly just words.

Oh and for the record my husband would only have given a one star, not two as I have.

Whilst the decor is quite quirky, the hard wooden bench seats we were given were quite uncomfortable.

Unfortunately, we will not be returning to the Knights Table which is a shame as we do like to support local businesses.

Food was brilliant, bags of flavour and reasonable. The Wine list was above average with most bottles on the higher end of what you'd expect to pay, but you do pay for what you get.

Specials were nice but not for me on this occasion as I'd already decided ahead of time on the choices.

Tips; book early and in advance, clearly a popular choice for locals and mid week. Look at the specials and try the Rioja.

More like a starter size but at £21 felt it was very mean. Still felt hungry after this course, so decided on a dessert which I am usually too full to order!! Other orders within our party were the steak and a venison stew. Again the stew was a small portion served in a small pot soup toureen type dish with 2 tiny dumplings on top.

I hadn’t heard great things but my Nan and grandad had booked it for their 60th wedding anniversary. All together there were 12 of us. From the get-go we all felt quite rushed to eat - we had already let them know our ordered before we arrived and we were serviced within 5 minutes of sitting down. I had roast beef and it was disappointing - the potatoes tasted like frozen Aunt Bessie’s. It was all slightly cold as well. I asked for some more gravy and the waitress who looked so miserable said she would get some. I waited for 10 minutes and still no gravy. I asked again and she said ‘yes I’m getting it’ in a very teenage stroppy kind of way. She then comes out with the gravy in a measuring jug!!!!!!

When it came to the cake and Prosecco, I was refused a glass of Prosecco (despite being 27 and being with my whole family) because I didn’t have my ID. I understood, but to then be told by the waitor that if I tried to drink any he would come and physically take it away from me was extremely rude and threatening.

On Butlin's dine around package and the wife only wanted a small pizza.

Waitress: No madam you can only have a medium pizza on dinearound.

Me: No No the wife won’t eat all a Medium pizza, a small will just be fine otherwise it’s a waste of food.

Waitress: No you MUST have a medium.

Me: No No you have a corporate responsibility not to waste food we will only have a small.

At which point the waitress stormed off without taking our order and shouted after the manager in a hissy fit. No I will be back in a minute Sir or let me check with the manager Sir. Just a full on childish tantrum from the waitress.

All for asking for less food for the money we are paying. There are people in this world that can’t afford to eat and this waitress wants to just waste food and throw tantrums. Where is your CSR policy papa Johns/Butlins. The waitress then refused to serve us for the rest of the meal, most likely due to her own embarrassment. No apology given for her utter childish performance.

We managed to get the reduced small size meal for the price of a medium in the end and the remainder of staff/Manager were very attentive.

Unfortunately our day ruined by one.

883,Magna Tandoori,Food,Bognor,Restaurant,141,Fawlty Towers revisited,"I have found Bognor Regis’s answer to Fawlty Towers, The Magna Tandoori. We have just spent part of our evening watching a gradually unfurling tale of woe.
We’d booked and arrived on time, were shown to our table in a very busy Restaurant and sat watching for quite some time before we had to ask for someone to take our order.
This gave us the opportunity to watch a procession of waiters walking up and down the restaurant, without appearing to notice what was going on.
We were being served by a waiter who seemed to have a wish that he was a million miles away from the restaurant, to say he was surly, rude and couldn’t really care less what was happening to us would be an understatement, he then proceeded to ask the order taker to accept our food order.
A starter devoured, a Prawn Puri, as food goes it scored around 3 out of 10, boring and heat with no spice zing to it. Having used some cutlery a new fork came bouncing across the table with all the grace of a Barnes Wallis bouncing bomb, thrown instead of placed. New plates were treated similarly with no grace at all.
The food, served reasonable quickly considering they were so busy, was quite good, not spectacular, but regular ‘Indian Food’, in good sized portions and reasonably priced.
Behind us continued the melee of people, it was bit like eating in a train station. Trying to pay, after finishing what we wanted to eat, was again moments of delights and leaving our utensils at the finishing positions on our plates, we were passed by at least 6 waiters who looked at our plates and just walked on by, sometimes walking to the other end of the Restaurant and walking back again.
You would have thought the fun would stop there, but they had one last treat for us, the bill was brought, with hot Towels and 2 After Eight mints between 3 people.
So, thank you Magma for such a fun ‘Fawlty Towers’ evening.
Will we be back?
Maybe when Customer satisfaction comes higher on your list, than cramming them in and some of, not all, your waiters realise we are customers. If I want to be treated this way I will go back to Won Kei in London, where the Waiters are expert in the art of giving customer satisfaction by being rude all the time but have perfected this art so well that we enjoy it.",2.0,1.0,Asian/Oriental,1

The DJ was very good playing a wide spectrum of music that suited those that wanted to get up and dance. The finger buffet supplied was excellent and the quantity was more than enough, I would suggest ordering for 10 less than invited to avoid waste. The venue itself is great for the number we required with various options for the guests to either sit outside or stand at the bar and catchup and those that want to dance stay in the function room.

Very few options for vegetarians.

Peppered chicken for a kids meal? Peppered over cooked chicken which meant that no amount of chewing would break it up to actually be eaten.
My chicken was over cooked to the point it was burnt and that was the over powering taste of the dish.
The chunky chips had a funky taste to them which was not pleasant.
My sisters vegetarian options were revolting and cold in the middle.
The salad bar which is what we like about going to the harvester was a disappointment, brown lettuce, and the rest of the salad bits, coleslaw etc was all wet and soggy/slimy.

Fresh local Sea Bass and Prawn Sauce advertised via the chalkboard was the preferred substitute. Sat here awaiting with a long face, the King Prawns with Garlic and Chilli starter arrived. Immediately my smile returned, the Prawns looked & tasted lovely. Unfortunately my enjoyment was interrupted with Pettycoat Goverment wanting to swap her starter choice of Crispy Korean Sesame Chicken as she found it too spicy. To keep the peace and harmony in our relationship we duly swapped. The Chicken was succulent and crispy & deboned, well done Chef. He also kept the head on the prawns but took time out removing the shell over the main body. Nice touch chef!!!

1001,George & Dragon,Food,Arundel,Pub/Bar,4,"Sadly, they've lost my business. ","I would love to tell you that we had a wonderful time, sitting in the garden admiring the view with sandwiches and a pint, but we didn't even get to order. Arrived at 12pm, most of the tables were empty. I waited a few minutes to be served at the bar, and asked if it would be ok to eat in the garden as I was confused why there was a sign saying that food was only served on the small terrace - why would we want to sit there, crowded with nasty metal tables, when there's a beautiful pub garden to enjoy? The lady behind the bar asked if I had made a reservation, to which I had replied that I hadn't. I was then told, very firmly, that those who had booked got priority. Fine, we only want sandwiches and I understand if the kitchen is busy, I said, thinking a packet of crisps would tide us over. How long is the wait? ""Even sandwiches take time,"" said the woman behind the bar like I was some kind of idiot, ""and there are FIVE tables to give their orders before you!"" What? They haven't even ordered? How is the kitchen busy? I don't think they had even arrived! It was the beginning of service, they weren't busy. I left with my family, without ordering anything. I've never been greeted in such an inhospitable manner when going to a pub, especially by the person who I assume is the landlady. She should have advised, politely and with a smile, that there would be a bit of a wait as they were busy, but asked what I wanted to drink - it's a pub, afterall! But, nope. Years spent waitressing has made me more sympathetic than most, but I was made to feel like my custom wasn't wanted. Thousands of pubs across the land manage lunchtime service, and of course on busy days there will probably be a wait, but there was no excuse for the treatment we received today. The staff were rude, service is a shambles - it was chaos behind the bar already, and all these unnecessary rules to help them cope with serving food goes to show how incompetent they are at running a pub.

Food is ok, though they do not have anything like it is stated on the menu. The main courses like lamb shank, salmon is spotless, great, but the side dish is not what you order. With none of the orders. They provide a few vegan food, but more then half of it they ran out. (On a Sunday it means the restaurant is not prepared for guests.) It is hard for a vegan person.
Not mentioning the problems with the coffee.
Payment is complicated f you want to share the bill with your friends. Basically a menu is thrown to you and calculate and figure it out on your own what you ordered and need to pay.
A well operated place is doing that you say what you ordered they add up on there terminal and it is done, bill is out.

477,World's End,Food,Arundel,Pub/Bar,459,Rubbish roast! Expensive rubbish too.,"If you look at the menu here it seems the manager has ideas above his station, and above the capabilities of the cook as well! Far too many items on the menu, so hardly surprising they're poorly executed. Prawn cocktail with peppers and celery in it to bulk it out, ewww, probably why they think they can charge ridiculous prices, just for being pretentious.

The roast beef lunch wasn't worth £5 (it was nearly £15). The meat was OK but it certainly didn't melt in the mouth, took a fair bit of knife work to cut up unfortunately. The gravy was bland, tasted like dishwater. The roast potatoes were advertised as being in beef dripping, they definitely weren't! I do roast potatoes in beef dripping every time I cook a roast, they crisp up nicely and have great flavour, these potatoes were really bland and tasteless, not even seasoned.

The Yorkshire pudding was OK, but tasted strangely sweet, like it was cooked using honey (would have been great for a dessert with ice cream and maple syrup topping but) not great with a savoury roast. Worst of all were the vegetables! I like mine Al dente, these were practically raw! Seems like they were heated up in boiling water but then served before they were cooked. No horseradish or mustard offered at any point.

As I popped to the ladies loo I couldn't but help notice a lot of plates which had contained roast dinners were left on tables with lots of veg still on them. Shame none of the waiting staff mentioned the undercooked veg to the cook.

We received 2 check backs within a minute of each other, both less than 2 minutes before we finished trying to eat our food, so certainly not worth wasting time pointing out how awful the food was.

The cook obviously doesn't taste what he/she serves to customers, pretty sure if the food was tasted anyone worth their salt wouldn't have the nerve to hand it to customers and actually charge for it. I wouldn't eat here again if it was free! I value my taste buds and stomach.

Looks good from the outside but definitely a place to keep driving past!

I went for lunch today (Thursday 3rd Jan). Being fully aware and accepting of the ""round table"" policy, I made a polite enquiry regarding it being acceptable to sit there as we were a table of two. I was assured by the waitress that it was fine. After a few minutes perusing menus and having ordered our drinks we were asked (by a different ""waitress"") to move to the ""long shared table"" as a party of three had arrived .I politely suggested that there was evidently room for three at the long shared table (albeit involved requesting someone move along a seat at the ""shared long table"") and that it was not reasonable to ask us to move. The ""waitress"" (whom I now believe to be... is apparently the owners wife) then made a sarcastic confrontational comment about my lack of co-operation, and re-iterated the policy in ear shot of all... (which I had previously confirmed with staff was OK). While this was going on, my guest moved us both to the end of the long table as it had been kindly and pro-actively vacated by another couple... the same ""owner's wife"" lady then proceeded to snatch away our drinks and menus and announced that she was refusing to serve us and wanted us to leave... simultaneously shouting across the crowded restaurant that ""I had been rude to her on several previous occasions""... never having to my knowledge met or spoken with this lady before this was both unbecoming and untrue. I objected to this treatment and questioned her observations and commitment to the hospitality industry, maintaining at all time a civil tongue. She then decided to suggest inviting her husband downstairs to which I agreed. Her husband was not prepared to entertain any explanation from me and asked me to leave which I immediately agreed to do. He stated that ""he knew his wife well enough"".... of that I have no doubt. Maybe she would be better suited to an alternative role away from FOH. Very upset, and truly very concerned for her level of stress/anger/honesty, and now reluctantly unwilling to return if that customer service is considered policy.
Based on other reviews and the untruthful allegations made on the day, I fully expect this to be treated as an inaccurate account, however why would I? I can assure you this is 100% to the best of my recollection. I am very upset. Possibly she mistook me for someone else? - if that is an excuse? I loved eating in your restaurant. Feedback is a gift.

For one of our drinks I ordered a G&T, as they have a good choice of gin, and was watching the gin being poured into the measure and was very surprised to see that it was a short measure and when the team member was challenged they denied it. Measures should be filled to the top, not half a centimetre below because they’re afraid to spill the spirit.
On ordering our food I asked for gluten free mozzarella sticks to be told that there were none. This isn’t the first time there has been menu items or drinks unavailable because of poor stock control.
When our meal was delivered one item had to be returned as it was cold and a gluten free burger had a gluten containing side on the same plate which had the risk of cross contamination.
For desert a gluten free was ordered and when it was subsequently brought to the table it had a wafer in it, so was sent back.
Whilst our food related problems were resolved there appears to be a wholesale lack of knowledge about allergens and this should be addressed as a matter of urgency.

I ordered sag paneer - which is supposed to be cubes of cheese and spinach with cream, coconut and spices. What was actually served was dire. It was made with normal cheese which melted, so was mushy, with no flavour, at all, (no spices were added) a ton of cream and spinach. I only ate a very small amount, because it was so awful. I have never had sag paneer made with normal cheese, I tried it and regretted it - normal cheese in sag paneer is wrong and lazy.

I also ordered a side of vegetable curry. What I actually got was a bowl of frozen veg - peas, green beans, carrots in what I can only describe as slop. It looked like soup made with frozen veg. I sent that back and they offered a replacement. I declined.

My friend ordered a vegetable shashlic and that was slightly better, because it didn't look like soup and had a bit more flavour. Considering the cost to make with fresh vegetables, it was shocking to see most of ingredients were still obviously from a frozen packet.

(No Quorn curry on offer, which most good restaurants now serve for veggie customers).

The nan was great, perfect.

The rice was ok, hard to get that wrong.

The bread is cut fresh from the loaf and unbeknown to the lad my sandwich was quite thin on part of its slice so exhibited 2 holes within the slice.
What did I get back within less than a minute but another sandwich with a thin top slice and 2 holes in it. Told the lad it was the same sandwich and he said they had replaced with new bread.
No apology from him.. took it straight back to the ordering point and said I'm not eating that.
Later a girl waiter came over with another sandwich which was refused.
Had to explain to her that an apology would have been nice.
Received a refund which I didn't ask for as thought I'd return the compliment with a trip advisor review.

It’s quirky with lots of bits and pieces on the wall which kept my son entertained. They have a treasure chest of sweets for the children to choose one and the staff are very friendly.

What makes this place is the food! It’s a particularly generous cafe for great prices in my opinion. Much better than I have experienced in a while. I ordered a cheese ploughman’s which was very generous but the neighbouring table ordered a large breakfast and I have never seen a platter like it! The gentleman concerned was surprised and asked if he had paid for all they brought over as there was a lot of food!

Another customer then walked past and exclaimed about the amount of cheese on my
plate so people were all intrigued with the food choices.

There were choices for n the menu from shepherds pie to sandwiches, cooked breakfasts to ploughman’s and a kids menu.

Far credit to the waiter though, as he spotted this and said he wouldn’t charge for my plate. Still hungry, I ordered a sticky toffee pudding. Don’t make that mistake.

1275,"Crossbush, Beefeater",Food,Arundel,Restaurant,2,Very Disappointing Birthday Breakfast,"The standards we have experienced on previous visits here have all but disappeared.

This visit was for a family member's breakfast for seven of us. On arrival we were eventually greeted and told that there was no record of any pre-booking, however, we were eventually taken to a seating area which was away from the main area and nobody else seated in there which made it feel a little unwelcoming to start with.

After a while a waitress appeared and took our breakfast orders. There was no welcome smile or warm reception from her in fact she was quite offhand and abrupt.

In the meantime we went to the self-service breakfast bar which was in bit of a mess and was urgently needing some attention from the staff.We had to request decaffeinated coffee for two of us from a staff member and after a short wait he appeared with one single sachet of decaff coffee despite two of us requiring it! So off he trots and returns with a second sachet, not any to stock up the table. The fruit salad that we had was just about edible as the orange segments were extremely tough and bitter.

After a considerable wait some of the cooked breakfast meals arrived at the table albeit different to the orders we placed. There was no offer from the waitress to resolve the mix up this so we sorted it as such by swapping items from plate to plate. The food itself was just about warm but just about edible. After another wait the remaining outstanding meals arrived which were as ordered. Again they food wasn't very hot. We proceeded to eat the breakfast which was nowhere as good as it had been on previous visits. The bacon flavour was tainted by what tasted like steak from the griddle. The eggs were a little undercooked and so it went on.

My wife ordered poached eggs with bacon and tomato which when it turned up looked lost as it was a small portion served on a full sized plate. So she eat this but decided to order the same again as the first portions served up was very small and the eggs weren't cooked that well. After a wait of 15 minutes or more her reorder eventually arrived at the table but way after everybody else had finished their food. This felt awkward to her but she did reluctantly eat it only because we persuaded her to. This food was also only just warm so again very disappointing.

For what we paid, the whole breakfast this time didn't feel like good value for money and the unwelcoming service from the staff really spoilt what should have been a happy family occasion. We didn't wish to remain in the restaurant anymore so settled the bill and left.

As a result of this very disappointing visit, it's very unlikely that we will be returning there very soon for another family visit.

700,The Town House,Food,Arundel,Restaurant,32,Very good indeed. We would definitely come back,"We stayed and ate at the Town House last weekend. This review covers restaurant and hotel.

Hotel first: There are four or five rooms - it's small. We stayed in Thyme, which was the last room they had available. The owner warned us it was on the small side, which it was, but it was very comfortable and spotlessly clean. It's at the back, so no view of the castle. But the bed was comfortable, the linen was good and we had a good night's sleep.

The restaurant: So the Town House is a restaurant with rooms attached, rather than a hotel with a restaurant. And the meal we had was very good. The room is smallish - 20-30 covers at most. It's in a Georgian town house, so you eat underneath this remarkable moulded ceiling. And the atmosphere is warm and welcoming. There's not a long fire in the corner, but there probably should be.

The service was great - very friendly and helpful without being overbearing. The menu is short, which I always like. And the food was very good.

I had scallops to start - they tasted fresh and were very nicely cooked. Juicy and sweet and caramelised on top and bottom. Served with a pea puree (which was slightly on the wet side for my tastes) and a crispy piece of parma ham - the saltiness and crisp of the ham complementing the sweetness of the scallops. A winner (and more proof that decent ingredients, sensitively cooked are all you need)

Main was roasted venison - served a little pink (but they had OK'd that with me at ordering) - with baby onions, wildmushrooms and roasted potatoes. I really like cooking like this - everything was properly cooked and seasoned, and it was rich and delicious.

My wife had the beetroot and goat's cheese salad to start, halibut with a rosti to follow. Both were very good

I didn't have a dessert, but my wife had the cherry frangipane tart, that she enjoyed thoroughly.

With a bottle of wine, the whole thing came to just under £100. Which is excellent value for a meal like this.

Back to the hotel: breakfast the next morning was also excellent. The full English wasn't at all greasy and it was very lovely too.

So if we are in the area again, we will definitely stay at the Town House again. Try to get one of the rooms with a view of the castle.",1.0,2.0,Other,0

Neither Burger had any BACON in them and one burger only had one layer of lettuce and sauce in it. One burger had gerkins and one did not. Both burgers seemed to have been thrown together with everything falling out and were very disapointing. I understand mistakes can happen but this was more than just a mistake it was poor quality control. We will not be having this item again, and if we had lived nearer we would have returned to ask for replacements, which I do believe would have happened. However, how many other take away customers have had this happen to them? and this is why I have posted the review, so that action can be taken to improve.",1.0,2.0,British,1

First impressions were that of nice welcoming clean place. Went in and stood behind another family waiting to be seated. Seem to wait a good 8-10 minutes for someone to even come and acknowledge us. Finally a man came out and we were seated. Then again it seemed painfully slow before our order was taken. Ordered, but what I wanted they didn’t have any of, neither was the coffee machine working and when they finally bought out my strawberry and mint cooler I was informed that they’d run out of strawberries to decorate it with! Food was hot and fresh though.
Decided against a dessert as thought we might be there for another hour or so and didn’t have the time to wait!!
All in all not very impressive. Not particularly busy but staff slow and inattentive, no sense of urgency to see to customers and get them fed.
Wouldn’t recommend.

Main courses arrived with a green chicken curry - not too hot, freshly cooked vegetables in a light sauce, a plate of sweet and sour items, noodles and rice. All lovely.

632,"Crossbush, Beefeater",Food,Arundel,Restaurant,94,Overpriced Xmas dinner - couldn’t fault the staff! ,"So we booked Xmas dinner here for 4 adults & 1 child, were met by cheery staff whom I’m
Sure would rather have been elsewhere on Xmas day.
The meal was expensive at almost £60 a person and didn’t even include any drink.
I just hope at that price that the company that own the Beefeater pay their staff handsomely for working this day and don’t leave them to rely on tips!

So the meal was a bit of a mix - my starter of a soufflé came out cold in the middle.
On our main courses I paid extra for cauliflower cheese and also one tiny Yorkshire pud and a few small sausages - a bit rich considering they missed off the carrot mash that was advertised on all our meals- I don’t know if this was a genuine error but none of us had this on our plates!
No biggie but when you charge £3 for some cauliflower cheese but don’t even bother putting the advertised menu on the plate then it kind of sticks in your throat!

As with another reviewer we also opted for the chocolate bombs and although we ate earlier around 12.30 we had the same issue.
The bomb didn’t melt because the sauce wasn’t even hot!
If this was a normal day then I’d say the amount we paid £260 (just for the food) was an utter rip off - sadly you’re not paying for the food or even the quality of the food - you’re paying for the day you eat, however with that said it would of been nice if you actually got what you paid for!
The veggie roast I have to say was delicious, actually the saving grace of the meal.

Go into the place and i was the only person there other than an elderly gent, door open on a cold day, tried to shut door which was stuck open. Music playing in the back kitchen where the host (presume Vicky) was at doing nothing in particular. Eventually she came to the front, no hello, no smiley face just a miserable attitude. I ordered a bacon sandwich and a cup of tea. I asked politely for ketchup on the sandwich, then informed “it’s on the table”. I asked for strong tea without sugar, to be told abruptly “sugar on the table and the bag’s left in to sort myself”. It cost £3.50, I only had a £10 note and was rudely asked if I had smaller. I said no and offered a card, then got change and sat at the table. Then the other gent got up and ordered, same attitude and when he asked for crispy bacon was told “obviously that’s going to take longer”.
After a while and relative silence in the restaurant area and muffled music from the back, my sandwich was delivered (nearly thrown on the table). Dry old bread, under cooked bacon and cheap Margarine. Someone else came in during my stay to check if they were open as he’d tried on two previous days to get in and they were shut. He was given such attitude by this lady that I’d be surprised if he came back with his 5 friends, I wouldn’t have and certainly won’t be going back there again.

Parking a problem - both car parks in front and behind the restaurant were full at 6.50 p.m. so, had no choice but to park on the road - imagine the neighbours are probably fed up with this. Evening started off well enough although, as some other reviewers have noted - what, exactly has been refurbished! My sister commented that the carpet looks the same as when it was the Smugglers Roost (30+ years ago!). Lots of people in the bar area with the football on, restaurant busy and we were early - 7 p.m. The restaurant is large and we were seated in the area where the restaurant bar is and where takeaways are collected from. From the very beginning, the noise levels are significant, making it almost impossible to have a normal conversation, the phone constantly ringing for takeaway orders and people in and out to collect. We opted for the 'All you can eat' buffet which is good value for money as, other than the 2 Lobster dishes, you can chose anything you want. However, whilst the food is plentiful, I can't say it had much flavour to it. The evening started to deteriorate when the staff started to bring out wrong dish after wrong dish to us and, when we politely pointed this out, the correct dishes took ages to arrive so we were all eating at different stages. The staff became grumpier as the evening went on with one young girl looking like she had been in floods of tears, one couldn't help herself but slam everything onto the table and a smile was certainly beyond her, another was the only one who seemed to know what was going on and was apologetic over the service. My sister used the ladies toilet at the end of the evening and said she felt as though her shoes were sticking to the flooring - yuk!

So we ordered- the waiter was the same man who had answered my call earlier and was surly and unhelpful.
The rose wine we ordered was unavailable and a bottle of Barefoot was offered as an alternative- which is available at 2 for £10 at a local convenience store. He agreed to let us have it at the price of our chosen wine - £15.95.
Food ordered- fairly uncomplicated other than my partner not wanting Lamb tikka on his mixed grill.
Poppadoms and dips were fine - predictably he tried to take them away when we were done so we had to ask for them to be left for our main.
Mixed grill arrived and looked good, apart from the pile of unasked for Lamb tikka - this was replaced with chicken when mentioned.

Waiters and waitresses were very attentive, friendly and helpful. Couldn’t have asked for more from them.

However- that’s all the positives out the way. For around £27 per person per head- I had a couple of pints of coke, nachos starter, Double stack burger, and crumble desert.

Nachos- were disgusting. Cheap quality. Disgusting fake cheese. Guacamole straight out of a jar and lumps of tomato dumped onto the plate (once it’s been nuked in a microwave). It was bland and tasteless... it’s so easy to make Guacamole & Salsa- why the hell is it not made fresh?! And the cheese... jeeze, use REAL cheese!!

The Double Stack Burger- was ok. Burger was burnt, but actually tasted average. Definitely had better burgers- but it was not bad. However- all my parties chips were brown, did not taste or look fresh and were basically ‘just about’ warm... so pretty pathetic in reflection.

The Apple & Berry Crumble was a huge disappointment. Again heating of the custard seems to be an issue- barely warm it was. The crumble topping was nice- the rest was more like a soup. Pretty awful!!

I have been to many restaurants that serve much much better quality food for half the price. This restaurant is totally overpriced and not worth it. The food is very poor quality, lazily prepared and ‘slopped’ together. Do not expect anything of quality or fresh.",4.0,2.0,British,1

Waited nearly 30 mins for a Burger and Pie. I had to check how much longer we had to wait and was told it would be out of the kitchen next . And as if by magic it was.
Then the real disappointment the Wagyu burger was done to a crisp - I mean really well done. We asked the waitress to take a look at how well done the burger was. She told us that it was the company policy to server burgers ""well done"" and she walked off without further debate.
The ""company"" should visit The Gribble Inn to see how a burger should be cooked and served.
The pie was good but carrots were sad and cabbage (assumed cabbage) was good to death and had little flavour. A couple of pictures attached.

Contrary to the indifferent feedback left by another reviewer, I found the pulled-pork scotch egg superb- really well seasoned and tasty. Sure the egg was small but the clue is that it is a quails egg!!! It could have been runny and this wouldn't have made it superb. The liver was fantastically cocked - very tender - and the fish pie the best my wife has had - and she LOVES fish pie. The wine is on the pricey side (£30 for a Rioja is a bit steep when most charge £15-20) but apart from that a superb evening. Without the wine it would have been £63 for three courses - a bargain.

The young guy behind the bar was very sweet - he's the reason I am giving The Norfolk Tap 2 stars rather than 1. The young guy asked how we were and what we would like. I asked what alcohol free beers they have - they didn't have any, but he said he could pop across and get a couple of Becks Blue for us from the hotel - we were more than happy and grateful that he would do that.

Then someone said very loudly in an aggressive tone ""why would you do that"", I didn't realise he was talking to us at first, then he said it again but louder. I assumed it was just a local at the pub, drunk having a joke. But I looked at him and he said very seriously ""Why would you come in here and order an alcoholic free beer, WHY?!"" I explained because that's what we wanted.

He then proceeded to go on about how he ran the place and didn't understand why people came in and ordered alcohol free beers. He was hostile and aggressive. Not a very nice way to greet new customers at all. He could see I was quite shocked and taken aback by what he was saying so started to backtrack. He kept saying we should try the 3.6% beer as it is low alcohol, I tried to explain to him that we aren't drinking. He couldn't seem to comprehend it at all. He said there are no good alcohol free beers so he wouldn't stock them. Which my partner and I both said there were lots of lovely alcoholic free beers out there. He said ""Well no local breweries that sell them"", I corrected him and told him there were. It's something my partner and I have looked into a lot. One brewery I gave him was the Laine brewery in Brighton - King Limbo is a lovely beer, it's extremely popular in Brighton and Hove, we've actually been told by a few bars and pubs in Brighton they can't believe how much they're selling of it. He clearly didn't know what he was talking about, which is fine, we don't expect people to know everything about non alcoholic beers, as it's a fairly new trend that seems to be picking up. What wasn't ok, was the way he spoke to us and treated us.

We promptly got our Becks Blues (which were smaller bottles than the normal and more expensive than normal as well), sat outside and drank them quickly and left. We were shocked and upset by how the guys spoke to us and certainly won't be going back there. Of course people can have their opinions but if you're running an establishment then you shouldn't criticise customers and keep your opinion to yourself.",2.0,2.0,British,1

1. I have poor sight and didn’t see it
2. The staff when serving should verbally warn you there’s a wait
3. When a customer complains in a good establishment they don’t just offer A weak half hearted apology. It would usually be met with a offer of a complementary drink to compensate for the wait while watching everyone else get their food before you ..
The only compensation was that the overpriced pie was very tasty, but it gave me heartburn because I ate it too fast.... because I was bloody starving !!!!!

1271,Pizza Hut,Food,Bognor,Restaurant,44,What a terrible place - avoid for special occasions!!,"We were staying at Butlins for the weekend for my son’s birthday and thought Pizza Hut might be a good place to go for dinner to for his birthday as he loves pizza. I booked a birthday table online specifically stating it was a birthday (they have a separate page for special occasions), and then called up the restaurant to ensure they understand it’s for a birthday and arrange decorations as promised on the site.

We turned up on Friday, 21st June, and told them we were there for the birthday table. The lady helping us found the booking, asked us who the birthday table was for, and then we handed over the cake to her.

We noticed there were no decorations or anything on the table - just a plain table with your usual menus. We were a bit surprised as we always got decorations and our server at least wishing my son a good birthday at Papa John’s. At least we have a cake, we thought.

Dinner goes fine and service was okay. We waited for about 30 mins for the cake, and finally, fed up, we asked for our cheque. The lady brings the cheque, we pay and she thanks us for visiting.

Confused, we ask her about the cake. She apologises, goes back into the kitchen and comes back with the cake - still in the box and in the plastic bag and leaves it on our table and walks away (with an apology though). It was a surprise, but she just puts the box in front of my son.

Thanks, Pizza Hut, for ruining my son’s birthday. Taught us to stick with Papa John’s - which we ended up doing - we re-did the birthday there the next night. Shame on you Pizza Hut - your brand will not be seeing us visiting again.

Closing this place down would only improve the reputation of the brand name - I hope they do!

Offer to have take-away. “No”.
Get to table at last. No one to take order.
Eventually food arrives - but our main courses. Where are our starters?
Hopefully you get the picture - chaos!
We did start to eat eventually. However allowing all the guests to arrive at the same time is asking for trouble. Of course the kitchen and the waiters can’t cope.
It would have been so simple to have said “No, we have no table reserved for you. No, we can’t serve you very soon, No, you will have to wait and No we can’t serve a takeaway as the kitchen is unable to cope.
We would have gone somewhere else but returned on another day.
The food is good, the waiter was sorry and able to laugh with us and was appologetic.

1201,Toast,Food,Littlehampton,Café,4,Home Delivery - Extremely Disappointing !,"Since first going to Toast some 5 years ago, I have returned many, many times. I have also recommended to friends and family. This cafe always represented excellent value for money, great service and a warm welcome from staff. In fact I’ve written positive reviews in the past about this establishment, so today’s poor review is out of character for me, but justified.

At 11:37 this morning I placed a telephone order for Steak & Kidney Pudding, peas, mash and gravy. I have never ordered a home delivery before, but as I’m confined to home following major surgery this seemed a good idea. I was told the waiting time would be 45mins. After an hour had passed I called to find out where the order was. The woman said it had literally just left. Well it took the guy over 10 mins to deliver and I live literally one road away. Despite the fact the meal was 25 mins late there was no apology whatsoever.

Upon opening the container the first thing I noticed was a piece of white plastic - which looks like it came from one of those disposable knives. The meal was luke warm and pudding dried out like it had been cooked a while before and then left. It certainly wasn’t fresh or enjoyable.

So in summary, I wouldn’t recommend the delivery service. They simply can’t provide quality in a timely fashion. They’re late and sub-standard. Really a complete waste of money.

I think having read other reviews Toast is a victim of its own success. It was once very good indeed, but clearly standards have dropped and with so much competition around I would suggest they need to get back to where they were or loyal customers like myself will turn their back on Toast!",2.0,1.0,British,1

Service was very good, staff were attentive and looked after us well, both our waitress and the manager who popped by several times to make sure we were happy with everything.

We both enjoyed our meals, the food was very well cooked and presented to perfection. However I think the duck breast I had fell a little short: the ""dauphinoise"" potatoes were very bland, and the duck itself would have benefitted from a stronger-flavoured red-wine jus or berries. The terrine I had as a starter was very good, with a nice combination of salads & flavours, but the actual terrine slice itself was minute. All in all, for the price, I expected a little more.

The atmosphere is nice, lots of people there to enjoy a relaxed evening out with friends, many of them dressed quite smartly due to the proximity to Goodwood.

Firstly we were greeted by a very rude man who seemed to see us as an inconvenience (I understand that there is a cafe attached but I feel that you shouldn’t offer take away if you can’t handle it) the poor cashier was lovely but seemed very uncomfortable and aware of the weird atmosphere, we then asked if we could have some smaller/ portions of chips which he seemed confused about and then simply said “no, we can’t halve portions”, weird , its chips, it’s not like we were asking for half of a of fried egg.
Then the chips...... wowee...why on earth would you waste a location like that by chucking some oven chips in oil and hoping for the best. They were rubbery bits of food formerly known as potato, no authenticity at all.

Curries were too sweet and gloopy. Tasted of supermarket bought curry paste.

We have travelled round Thailand and sampled a wide range of thai food, and we are perhaps spoiled by living in London with some very good, authentic thai restaurants nearby.

Visited in November to check where we would be seated as we needed to fit 2 prams next to the table. Was advised it would be a table in the main restaurant area with plenty of space - perfect - or so I thought.

We arrived on Christmas Day and were seated at a table in the conservatory area on the opposite side of the restaurant and it’s as if we were completely forgotten about. No Christmas decorations in this area and absolutely no atmosphere. We waited almost an hour for our starters and then almost another hour for our main courses. The majority of the food was lukewarm at best and when someone on our table asked for mustard, they were told there wasn’t any. The wrong food was also brought out several times. A table next to us were brought out desserts before they’d had their main courses! We also asked for some jugs of water for the table and were told they didn’t have any jugs available.

A very disappointing experience to say the least.",4.0,1.0,British,1

Very busy as there was a wake on but we were shown promptly to our table and drinks orders taken.

I had a starter of chicken liver pate. It was so light and very tasty. My son had shredded duck with plum, also delicious.

Mains were ribs from the specials menu, a couple of burgers and haddock and chips. All came out quickly and piping hot.i have to say, portions were generous and the food excellent. Burgers looked home made. I asked for a finger bowl with my ribs but I needn’t have bothered, the meat just melted off the bone. The accompanying coleslaw was delicious and felt home made.

Puddings were a couple of cheese cakes and a pecan pie. Again, all looked home made and all very good.

Together with a couple of rounds of drinks, bill was just under £100 which I think is pretty good value for the quality.

Lastly, service was very good from start to finish from the two young ladies that attended us on what was clearly a very busy evening, thank you both

I didn't bother to have a cake as they clearly couldn't be bothered to sell us them but the kids had a chocolate brownie which tasted of coconut (assume this was coconut flour) and said they were dry. My coffee had the tide out, I assume this was because I had it black and it was all the machine would provide, considering I asked for it black it would have been nice to add a little bit more water but hey like I said service isn't this places forte. And then to top it off at 3:55pm someone shouted to clear the tables as they were closing and then two young girls appeared and cleared our table.

The starters were okay, but the deep fried Brie was overdone, hard on the outside and cold in the middle. The vegetarian options seemed good, until we tried them. The veggie lasagne was small, approximately 3 inches square; bland and tasteless. The Squash was just average and dry, no sauce. I left most of it. The steak had a 2 inch piece of grizzle. The two Ploughmans however, were fine, nice big pieces of cheese. But the 'piece de resistance' was the treacle tart. Yes I am joking. There was no treacle in the treacle tart. It was just pastry that stuck in the throat. Inedible and most of it was left. We did complain, but it seemed to fall on deaf ears.

Some way into the meal my wife discovered a burned area inside the pasta dish too.
Very unpleasant.

My meal was a Pizza Carbonara, which had large lump of black carbon on the plate with it, and the egg in the centre was hard. All around the edges, the base was so hard baked that I could shatter it in many places with a tap of my knife. I requested a replacement soft egg which was provided without fuss.
Neither of us was able or willing to finish the meal.

We were looking for somewhere to have lunch and had previously been in the Diner for milkshakes earlier in our holiday and thought it looked like a good place to have lunch. However after picking our food from the lunch menu and looking forward to our food we were told we should not have been given the lunch menu as the previous day there had been such a delay getting the orders out from the lunch menu so they were not offering it yesterday!!!.. my husband and I were very annoyed as by this point we had all drank our drinks and made our choices and instead of having a reasonably priced lunch now only had the option to pick something from the main menu which was much more expensive and our disappointment and frustration meant we did not fancy anything from the main menu but felt it too late to leave even though I very much wanted to just pay for our drinks and leave and find somewhere else. So we made another choice and ordered the children their meals and were all disappointed with our food. My son ended up his tears he disliked his meal so much as the pulled beef in his taco's (which were supposed to be make your own but came already made up) was so spicy he spent most of the time soaking his tongue in his water and my daughter left most of hers as she said her chips were awful and the burger not much better. I ended up giving most of my dinner to the children so they had something to eat and got the bill leaving with a bitter taste in my mouth of the whole experience and paying £46 for some lunch!..

1248,"Crossbush, Beefeater",Food,Arundel,Restaurant,122,Happy Birthday- what a disaster,"My son decided to take my wife (Who’s birthday we were celebrating), me and his family out to the Crossbush Beefeater’s.

We had booked a table to 16:00, but arrived 15 minutes early. We were shown to our table at about 15:50 and given the menus to read.

After 35 minutes the kids were getting restless so I grabbed the next waitress to go past and asked what I needed to do to get server.

She said they were very busy and apologised after explaining she was the only person looking after the area. She asked if we had ordered drinks. As we hadn’t we gave her the drinks order which turned up one short after 15 mins.

We asked to see the allergy menu and were told that the manager would have to serve us and she’d as him to come over. 10 minutes later he comes over and asks us what we would like to eat. We asked for the allergy menu and after that was sorted we have him our order to be told that the roast dinners were all sold out. That’s the first we’d heard of that after need at the table for over an hour.

We placed our order and waiting over 40 mins for that to arrive.

My wife’s steak which was supposed to be medium to well done was cremated and dry, my sones steak as part of his grill was supposed to be rare to medium and was well done, his chicken was cremated. His wife’s cheese burger was burnt and dry. My pie was had rock hard pastry and over cooked vegetables. The peas were a funny green and tasteless as if they’d bee cooked for a long time.

All in all a disaster for my wife’s birthday.

I collared the manager and explained about the food, he apologies and said he wouldn’t charge us anything, but the damage was done.

We ate what we could and left as soon as we could.

This is the second really poor mean we’ve had at this beefeaters, so I cannot see us going back.

What is the point of doing a 40% off promotion as well a being in taste card if you done get the staff in both the front of the house and in the kitchen, they obviously didn’t get extra staff in either!

I would vigorously NOT recommend this restaurant.",4.0,2.0,British,1
475,Whittingtons Band Stand,Food,Bognor,Fast Food/Takeaway,14,Very poor fish and chips right next to the sea,"We were out for the day and as near to the beach, we thought we would pop to the seafront to get some authentic fish and chips and where better to get them than right on the beach? Well, so we thought.

The kiosk is situated just a matter of feet from the pebbles of the beach with sturdy solid benches literally inches from them so we thought we'd go here as felt like a perfect location. We ordered 'Crispy cod and chips'. Some time later after serving lots of people who had ordered after us but wanted just chips, ours was ready.

As soon as I opened the box my heart sank. It was immediately obvious that it wasn't proper fish and chips. The fish was a pre-made frozen portion, which looked very much like the stuff you get from supermarkets that specialise in frozen foods. You dont need to work in fish and chips to see it (and I have). It was so clear that this was not a fresh piece of fish, drenched in batter and fried there and then. It had been deep fried for sure - it was so drenched in oil that it was glistening in the sun. It was as tasteless as a piece of frozen portion which would expect to be. I should have been suspicious by the 'Crispy Cod and chips' on the menu as it didnt say 'fresh cod and chips' or locally caught etc.

Then there were the chips. They were not authentic chips that you would expect to get from a chippy. They were closer to french fries but fatter, and very uniform in shape more akin to something you would get in a school canteen.

A final minor point - they didn't have enough bottles of sauce, vingear etc out so they were virtually empty and I watched a number of people squirt out mostly air to small amusement as it sounded like blowing raspberries, but meant no sauce.

It was very disappointing. Easily the worst fish and chips that I have paid for, and it really shouldn't be that sort of food being right by the beach in a very British seaside town.

I don't know if the chefs have changed or if it simply depends who is working that night, but the quality of the food varies from visit to visit. Sometimes a dish like harissa and courgettes and halloumi will be tangy and spicy with a lot of sauce, other times it will have no spice or sauce at all. The wine is expensive - it seems extraordinary to charge £25.50 for a cheap bottle of prosecco - especially when at the other end of the street they charge £9.99 for a very similar bottle.

But the owners could not have been nicer and more accomodating and somehow found a quiet corner for us inside! There was a delay in taking our orders which was explained and the apology was completely unnecessary as we could see how busy it was. Also there was a great selection of beers to keep us going!

613,Fino,Food,Bognor,Restaurant,3,An anniversary ruined,"Now to be fair the waitress acted responsibly throughout.
The Aperol Spritz despite instructions on the back of every bottle was terrible the recommended 3 parts prosecco, 2 parts aperol and 1 part soda included at least 10 parts soda if any prosecco at all.
The rump steak was not rare as requested but well done and chewy but the worst was the under-cooked fish on the point of raw, concealed within a wrap of pancetta. This any chef will know is very dangerous and can lead to anisakiasis a parasitic disease caused by anisakid nematodes(worms) invading the stomach wall of humans. Offering to cook it again or replace it with something else just doesn't cut it when you are already beginning to doubt the ability of the establishment.
The waitress offered to replace the Aperol Spritz and took it off the bill. The fish course was also deducted but they left the uneaten fries on £3.

So half eaten steak and half bottle of wine consumed whilst waiting ad nauseum for food is a lousy way of spending an anniversary or any other celebration so I would recommend finding somewhere else that genuinely cares about quality.

Anyway back to the pub...We sat outside, there's lots of outside seating, some alongside the river in shade other tables hugging the front of the building, there are a couple of decent sized car parks but I should think in high season these would soon be full, given how much of a tourist attraction the town of Arundel is.Best way to visit would be to leave the car in a town car park and enjoy a ramble along the river bank!

There are some good real ales on for those that enjoy them and a good choice of wines. On to the most important thing....food! The food here was very nice, there was a wait as we were visiting in a busy lunch service, but it's well worth it. The sausages were fantastic, really tasty, and everything came out fresh and hot, Staff are attentive and friendly, one nice young lady fetched us fresh water for the dog without even being asked.

You also get a better selection of wine. For a £15 pizza, there must have been less than £1 of topping on it.

My first return visit in about 3 years. On positive side dogs are very welcome & everyone seems more interested in them than serving the customers!

We both ordered the Sunday roast lamb. It was £12.95 & very average. Lamb was luck warm, roast potatoes were terrible again luck warm & not cooked in the middle. The veg was a joke, for two of us we got a few bits of broccoli (5 tiny bits) 10 small carrot slices & some red cabbage. I am sure if one person had ordered a roast they would have got same amount of veg. Yorkshire puddings were as flat as a pancake. Asked for extra mint sauce. It was mainly vinegar & very little mint.

I can honestly say this is one of the worst roast dinners I have had.

The ladies toilets were disgusting and both of them were blocked & on the verge of overflowing. Very dirty & looks like they had not been cleaned for ages.

No wifi.

Only ordered 4 things, two roasts & two glasses of wine. Bill was not itemised but seemed expensive. When I queried it turns out they overcharged us £5 for wine!

Met by a lovely and polite young lady and as the only diner at 7ish was offered the pick of the tables, she was knowledgeable about the menu and brought me a very cold Estrella very quickly, she also did a couple of check backs.
Slightly annoying to hear somebody at the bar moaning about the F***ing glass washer and on a busier night may have offended customers but as I say probably staff night off or friends. Cod starter - cod was ok perhaps another few minutes would have crisped it up but the chicken along and dressings were lovely. Main course beef wellington that also probably required another 7/8 minutes to cook the beef thoroughly and fluff the pastry up fully.

All four of us who had left literally the whole bowl and yet not once were we asked if there was a problem or how our meal was.
The 5th person who had ordered it, got forgotten and he ended up with a carbonara to eat after we had all stopped trying to eat ours. His though,was even worse than ours. It was so far from al dente it was basically uncooked and other than the taste of flour there was no flavouring at all.

The tractor ride is lovely and the set up is great for getting close to the lambs, chicks and ducklings. It wasnt too busy so my daughter got lots of turns to hold the chicks. We have been here before and always been impressed. The volunteers are very good however left a little dissapointed by one this year, a young chap in the lambing section handing out the lambs to those who wanted to hold them. My daughter was waiting to be passed a lamb and as he got one and came over he was spoken to by another member of the public. He stood there holding the lamb he was about to put on my daughters lap and continued his conversation first leaving us waiting......all well and good had the conversation not been about how they ""Have a bolt put to the head"" obviousldy describing how they end up being killed and what is involved. I appreciate this is sadly the reality of what happens to some of the lambs but felt it a really unneccesarty conversation to have in front of children and whilst holding the lamb in his arms as we waited for him to finish describing a lambs final moments. Wasnt impressed by tis and luckily i do not think my daughter heard the conversation otherwise that couild have potentially been quite upsetting.

Entrance is very expensive and also very complicated. 4 different price plans for a ‘normal’ adult, then vouchers to use at the over priced gift shop and cafe. You get asked at least 6 times during your visit to the castle to show your ticket.

The biggest disappointment was the lack of history explained. The information given as you walk around is in no sensible chronological order and doesn’t give any stories. You do however know the dimensions of a room, when it was renovated and by whom. I don’t care about that, give me some basic simple history please. Like in every other castle and historic home.

The wife and I were really looking forward to our visit and were left very disappointed. We were planing to bring the children sometime but we won’t waste our time or money now.

12,Butlins Day Visits,Attractions,Bognor,Amusements/Fun,30,Mislead dirty not much open,"Came to Butlin’s 70’s weekend with 10 other work ladies.
We paid extra to be on the ground floor and together. (Gold) We got the ground floor but were in different blocks😬. On complaining the receptionist said we were never going to be together as they do not have two 6 person rooms together so we were mislead on booking. She said she would listen to the taped conversation to see what Butlins had said and call us back, still waiting.

Room block 4 floor was filthy and there were no shelf’s in the oven, shower head kept falling of.
Room block 5 floor was also filthy and all our pans etc had not been washed. Lots of cigarette buts out side our room which kept getting walked in. Was told they would be cleared up but never was.
A cleaner did come over and clean the rest of stuff that we hadn’t finished cleaning on arrival.

Wanted to hire the bikes out, but apparently they do not hire them adults only week ??
The fair was not open either.

We all paid to have a spa, the changing rooms had two toilets and two showers no changing separate room which is uncomfortable if you don’t wish to get changed in front of anybody, we were all queuing for a shower.
The main changing room was very small and hot, very uncomfortable considering you should be relaxing.
The spa itself seem to have to many people in at once. It was over an hour before any of us could use the hot tub also the ice room was broke.
I did have a facial and that was very good.

The floors in the clubs were awful so sticky, your feet came out your shoes as you danced.
The bands were excellent

I recommend ordering a kids burger instead of an adult one as you get more for your money on a kids meal.

We were initially split onto two tables and the lady on the entrance arranged for us to be seated together, meanwhile we were asked to go to ""the bar"" (there was enough room for 2 people to stand). A make shift table was made with us perched on the end. A bottle of wine was eventually offered for this mix up. Unfortunately the evening got no better, the starter was terrible, vegetarian dish consisted of a slither of quiche, the same quiche on the main buffet table, some lettuce leaf with no dressing and 2 slices of a baguette which were marginally larger than a £2 coin and stale. The waiting time after the act and into the main meal was a long time eventually eating at 9 30. There was no organisation to the buffet and quality of food was terrible, it also ran out of a lot of things. Lastly the dessert was served at around 10.20, a slice of cake which none of the 12 people on our table could tell what it was, chocolate apparently.

The toddler area for under 4s is good too, quieter and no big kids to push them around so you don't need to be right next to your child to make sure they are okay.

The other areas are really good too, and fun for us adults as well. A few things need fixing or cleaning up but it's not too bad.

The service was mixed, every time we sat for a drink/food we had to ask for a menu/to be served and then chase them. Shouldn’t be a surprise we wanted to eat and drink, also bad for their business as they are losing out on revenue by not serving and making people wait.
The eve meal was disappointing, poor produce, small portions and very bland. The chef should not be Proud of that. My breakfast was lame, veggie breakfast with no sausage = one shrivelled tomato, one burn mushroom and a tiny portion of beans, looked pathetic on the plate!
The spa is run down, nice on the surface but tired and so so busy. Couldn’t even get a seat to feed our 8 month baby, loads of towels left and no one overseeing removing them.

Yesterday I was sadly disappointed. The lovely big pond next to the reception centre is being ""re-developed"" (I dread to think what that will turn out to be - from the little info given it looks alarmimgly commercial rather than preservational).

On the plus side the reed beds, newly trimmed, looked wonderful in the low winter sunlight and while the new boardwalk surfaces with built-in anti slip are noisier they do look to wear better than the previous chicken-wire solution.

I would like to apologise to the surly girl in the cafe whose kitchen gossip was interrupted by my presence - never mind lass, I paid by card so you didn't have the extra burden of working out change and could quickly return to the kitchen for more chat.
