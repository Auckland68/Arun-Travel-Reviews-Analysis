Lucie was very helpful in letting us park in the car park as we arrived early and then went to visit the castle which is a very short walk away. Our room was very comfortable with a small modern shower room. We ordered what we would like for breakfast and the required time the night before and my husband said the bacon was delicious! If we are ever in the area again I would not hesitate to return.

Add the cost of food, drinks and souvenirs and it makes for an expensive trip. Tacky teddy machines, overpriced icecream and queues everywhere you go. It's more like a horror day than a holiday.

3,286,Arundel,Accommodation,1,"Shocking There is probably nothing wrong with the other rooms in this Premier Inn, however I will never forget my night of torture in room 111.
Upon opening the door the physical barrier of heat struck me like a Mike Tyson blow.
The curtains had been pulled, and the window had unfortunately been left open by whoever cleaned the room. This allowed it to become superheated, and the pedestal fan that had been left running at full pelt was vainly struggling to circulate the air. This produced the same effect of the a fan oven turned up to 10.
So I popped out after opening the window to the full 3 inches allowed by the security wires, to try cool the room.
Alas it was a vain hope, as the room took on the semblance of a Tennessee Prison sweatbox, and my night was reduced to a couple of hours of rolling from one puddle to another!

The welcoming booklet explains how the air conditioning system works, in a different hotel, with a different system. The control panel on the wall stated that this system could not cool the room.

All in all, I pity the poor cleaning lady that had to remove my sweat soaked sheets, pillows, and quite possibly mattress. Not an experience I shall want to repeat ever

There was a Easter egg hunt which was good and the place was busy but not packed . This was first weekend since the new pool opened and we stayed in the wave hotel and had the premium dining plan.

So hotel very good ,having and inner bedroom for children is ideal (and a fridge) room spacious clean and fun animal designs of the towels made daily. The deck restaurant was good with a great choice , though wouldn’t want to eat like this for more than a few days (too easy to back for seconds) nice touch for parents is the table service via a buzzer.

Shows were very good for younger children as little miss and mr men were there - need to get there a bit earlier but sometime hard for children to wait as well

New pool is great for the features but does need some better management as the changing areas were in a real mess and appeared not to be cleaned during the day judging by the things left in the cubicles nappies etc.. lifeguards quite vigilant for a good reason but maybe not as friendly as they could be for a family resort ..

Staff in rest of resort were consistently great and this is a good reason to visit Butlins resort , we had an enjoyable family holiday, which is why we went there!

queue for bar was a joke think the staff were on holiday already
we left after an hour was mayhem

last night I went over an hour before to get a good seat to be meet by queue of children put there by the adults while the drunk at the bar come 5 mins to open time there all barged in which nearly ended in a fight no security to be seen
so I know this is near end of season but HT is always busy
Pros
Good fast food service in restaurant and bar
Nice staff in there
Caravan and park clean
Cons

Our two rooms were very clean and spacious with good ensuites, comfortable beds and other amenities. Breakfast consisted of an extended continental plus 5 or 6 tempting hot choices - all presented in a clean and cheerful room. Nothing on their website was misrepresented.

Exterior of hotel lovely but bedrooms just not up to standard. I won't stay again and will suggest my company reviews having this hotel on its books.

15,281,Bognor,Accommodation,0,"Ocean Hotel & spa fabulous. Splash waterworld disappointing  We stayed Friday 9th August for 3 nights. My birthday weekend and just me and my daughter in the Ocean Hotel twin room.
I’ll list the good points first....
Hotel, restaurant and room were all clean, room had twin beds but these were very small singles and not really suitable for a 6ft tall adult such as myself. Pillows were also uncomfortable so didn’t sleep well at all whilst here. However, generally we were satisfied with every other element of our stay in the hotel. Staff were all friendly, good selection of food in restaurant. Loved the pasta/omelette station for freshly cooked choices.
We had a 2 hour spa session followed by the complete calmness 2 in 1 treatment which was a facial and back massage. We both thoroughly enjoyed this time however the only downside I would say is that the spa session was 1.30-3.30pm with our treatments booked for 3.30pm this meant that we lost about 15 mins of spa time as we were required to shower, dry off and change into underwear for our treatments. Would be better to allow for showering time between spa use and treatment time.
Overall though the spa was lovely and good value.
The evening entertainment provided by the resort was excellent. A good choice of different shows and we sometimes found ourselves venue-hopping between CentreStage and Reds to make the most of the shows. The queue however for the Stephen Mulhern Show was unbelievable! We got there at 6.30pm for doors open 7pm, show start at 8pm and we joined the queue at the point where a Butlins rep was holding a sign saying “seats can not be guaranteed” Clearly a popular show so maybe have 3 shows instead of 2 would be a better way to ensure families can be seated together. I imagine it’s the same for the Diversity shows mid-week.
One other point was the draught coke tasted very watered down like it didn’t have enough syrup in it. I asked for a shot of cherry in it (as there is now an option to customize your drink) - however couldn’t actually taste the cherry at all.

Daytime activities....
We bought the Adventure passes when we booked which worked out good value for what was included. However the bowling lane broke whilst we were using it and had to be moved to another lane. I’m glad we didn’t pre-book the adrenaline passes as bad weather meant that the high ropes, zip wire and climbing wall were closed the majority of the weekend.

Now for the brand new Splash Waterwotld. ...
Disappointed is an understatement. Expected much better for the swimming pool considering it’s brand new. Not enough for teenagers or adults to do. One fast flume and one family raft flume. Some slides are under 18’s only so stood waited whilst my daughter queued for those. Stood queuing to get on the raft flume, stood queuing for the rapids. No decent size swimming space so stood in the wave machine area. Far too many people in there. Rapids were far too shallow (imagine the amount of water in a flume) so didn’t get pushed along by the force of the water at all & had to push myself along which was tiring after a couple of goes. Worst part was one of the slides after the rapid splits - the long way round - the drop was very painful. Felt like the bottom of the slide hadn’t been joined correctly. There was a painful ridge which resulted in nasty friction burns and bruises to my bottom as well as a graze & bruise to my ankle and and it ripped a hole in my brand new swimming costume, meaning I couldn’t continue in the pool. Massively annoying.

Going back to the changing rooms the exits to the changing rooms had filthy floors from too many outside shoes being worn inside. The main shower area was flooding out towards the lockers (blocked drains?) and the floors around the lockers were also filthy. Considering it was only about 11am I dread to think what they’d be like later in the day. Didn’t see anyone cleaning the floors at all.

One good point about the pool area was the variety/size and number of changing rooms. They also have spinners to dry off your costumes and plastic recyclable bags for you to take your wet stuff away in.

Overall the new pool which was the thing we were most looking forward to trying out was the most disappointing. Probably better suited to those families with toddlers as there’s a lot of younger themed areas in there.

16,301,Bognor,Accommodation,0,"Good break with a few improvements needed Booked a silver self catering apartment..first time going self catering.
We were upgraded to the gold apartment.
So the bedrooms are if good size and beds are clean and comfy in fact the whole apartment was clean and the walks white washed clean.nice patio area.
Internal doors and fixture and fittings a little tired. Paint splashed into wood!
Tv fine.
Sofas...look nice but you can't sit on them properly.. plastic so you slide off!
Kitchen...this is the area that lead to my complaint which was dealt with quickly and professionally.
The saucepan was burnt and the frying pan, the shelf in the oven broken and oven not cleaned. The cupboard door fell off. Very little kitchen equipment.however this was rectified quickly by the brilliant polite staff.
The bathroom shower only shame the power of water is poor..as it's a new shower.
Carpet is clean and new.
If the staff were given an inventory to make sure each apartment has the essentials and that things are fixed it would cause less complaints.
Other than that the apartment is fine.
Loved the evening entertainment and plenty to do during the day except there seems to be more and more 'paid' for activities..I didn't expect to pay for crazy golf!
The fun fair is the same may be a new ride would be good.
The new pool complex is brilliant and so do wonderful for the children. Second day the pool was freezing and the changing rooms was freezing on both occasions.
Watch out for the rapids..it's not rapid going around infact young age to push yourself round.. however the last slide is awful...it practically drowns everyone.. so they have 2 lifeguards to catch you...they need to sort that out!!!
Free shows throughout the day and few free activities but most as said are paid for.
Maybe a few new freebie activities needed to be included..even football was charged
for??
Overall for £379 3 nights it's been a good tiring holiday the kids have loved it.
Yes come here and you will enjoy it..just bring spending money with you.

17,2,Littlehampton,Accommodation,0,"Fun filled family holiday  We got home yesterday from a Monday to Friday stay after a weekend in Butlins - which is only down the road.
Arrived to somebody complaining at reception which meant the reception staff were distracted and I didn’t get much of a ‘warm’ welcome. But I did get an apology which was nice.
We had a deluxe 2 bedroom caravan which was brilliantly located in church meadows but had a horrible smell to it and wasn’t clean inside. We brought febreeze, anti bac wipes and bleach spray and had a good clean ourselves which made it better. We really needed to wash the sheets and hoover everywhere too, but this wasn’t possible or practicable.
The evening entertainment is absolutely brilliant and we loved it! This was probably the highlight of our holiday.
We brought our 2 year old a little ‘anxious the elephant’ teddy and somebody took it from her whilst on the dance floor. I told a couple of the entertainment team and they were so understanding and told me to speak to security because sometimes the parents of the children who take these toys, do the right thing and make their children hand them back. This didn’t happen in our case!
But, about 10 mins later, one of the entertainment team that I had spoken to, came towards me with a little replacement! She said she had spoken to the entertainment manager and he said it was ok for her to replace it, in case we didn’t find the one we had lost. It was the loveliest thing anyone has ever done! It made our holiday! This gesture alone would make me come back.
I’m sure the girls name was Emily! I really hope somebody reads this and passes on our gratitude to her! She deserves extra special praise for doing something so kind and for making our holiday so special.
The entertainment team in general are some of the best we have come across, and so friendly.
In fact, all of the staff at Church Farm are really friendly and nice.
The outdoor pool is heated and so fun!
The park is lovely and the outdoor seating is great, with loads of sun loungers and comfortable chairs and tables on the terrace.
If our caravan had of been clean and didn’t have the horrible smell our stay literally would have been perfect! I hope we were just unlucky with this.
We look forward to returning and we are already planning our trips for next year!
Thank you Emily!! (I really hope that’s her name - she’s the one with the lovely red hair!) You made our holiday so special!! Please pass this onto her!

I wasn’t sure how to spell her name but I managed to ask for the receipt today and got it. “ELISHA” always served with a smile, made sure my children had there cakes (Oreo ones) and milkshakes and by the second day knew my order, I was visiting in the morning and at night time and she was always smiling and made time to speak. Also made me and my partner the best caramel latte coolers! Yum! Please send this message to her from the pickard family... Also a big thank you to the wave hotel.

20,355,Arundel,Accommodation,1,"Worst experience ever I went to spend a relaxed weekend.The hotel has spa facilities and we found a good offer including 2 spa treatments
Our room was supposed to be “deluxe ” (please check the photos) it was facing the parking,the carpet had stains,the shower was about to fall…poor quality in all materials,we had the feeling that the hotel was built in the 90s and has no had any renovation.
When we arrived we were told that they had 2 weddings that night,that was not a problem at all.The issue was that around 1am the fire alarm started to beep.Being 8.5 months pregnant didn't help to get out of the room quick, went downstairs following the signals and we ended up behind the hotel in a dark and isolated point,nobody from the hotel was there to help
After 2 minutes someone said it was safe to go back -not an official communication from the hotel.
The following morning we discovered that our room was above the staff entrance to the spa or some other facilities so around 6am a door was banging constantly.Remember:8.5 months pregnant woman had 4h sleep.We complained at reception,but not any compensation (other than free hot chocolate –honestly?) was offered
The dinner was v nice, quality of the food and the choices, but not the service who forgot about the bread, brought us a different order and we were only 4 tables in the restaurant
The service,their response,noise, the terrible status of the room…those are not things you expect when you go to a Hilton and especially if you’re a Honors member

24,380,Littlehampton,Accommodation,0,"Short Family Break 4 nights spent at Church Farm, with 2 youngsters and the dog. Booked via the ‘Sun’ holiday promotion. Our stay was the week before the start of the school holidays so the park was reasonably quite.

We benefited from upgrading to a prestige van with 3 bedrooms, which was 2 years old. On arrival it was clean, tidy and well fitted out. Benefited from bedding, appliances etc in a quite location. Perfect for the family.

The park has a great entertainment area with evening shows, arcade and both indoor and outdoor pools. Although the pools aren’t large they are in good condition with a slide. Not sure how they will be in peak session / school holidays esp as changing areas are limited.

The mini market caters for your everyday needs. The shows were entertaining and as a family we enjoyed watching each night.

The only downside of the holiday was the pub / restaurant. Although open all day the quality and organisation was poor. Ordered breakfast (hardly any other customers present) and had to wait over 40 mins. When food arrived it was wrong and had to be sent back. Another long wait before it finally came by which time we had spent an hour waiting and had 2 hungry kids.

25,53,Littlehampton,Accommodation,0,"Exceptional service and exceptional surroundings We visited Bailiffscourt for supper last night to celebrate our Silver wedding anniversary. This is where we stayed, 25 years ago, and, even more romantic, we drove there in the same car, our 1969 MGB sportscar.

This hotel is one of the most beautiful places and settings on God's earth, and the welcome we received and the service throughout the evening was at the top end of excellent.

The food was very good. The wine list is one of the best I have seen in a while. This is a pricey place to visit, but not extortionate for a special occasion. We were very content.

If I was being picky - and at these prices, perhaps I should - the food was very good, rather than outstanding, when compared with the better restaurants we have visited in France in recent years. For example, my grilled sea bass was a little overdone and not as waxy as I would have expected, and generally the beautifully presented and delicious food lacked the last degree of inspiration one sometimes finds. That said, this is England, and I cannot recall a better meal in the UK in a long time.

As noted, and it is right to repeat, the service was really outstanding and the friendly comfortable atmosphere created by the staff permeates the whole place. Our desert plates were inscribed ""happy anniversary"" in chocolate, which was a lovely touch. We walked through the beautiful grounds to the beach after supper and watched the sun set. Oh, I didn't mention the dessert. I had a rhubarb and chocolate tart. That really was special!

31,406,Bognor,Accommodation,1,"Disappointing Took my little girl to see the ‘Amazing Animals’ 3D show, with a title like that I expected maybe safari animals or animals in the jungle or Antarctica or something. Turns out it’s actually about the worlds most venomous creatures where they had 3D wasps buzzing about, a snake biting at the audience, a shark attacking the audience, jellyfish which come down from the ceiling where the audience are warned ‘they will sting you’ amongst other things. It ends with a gorilla coming out and then chasing the hosts through a door where they could be heard screaming as they are being attacked. Before each venomous creature comes on there’s a rather loud scary alarm that goes off which freaked my daughter out each time it came on. Obviously it’s not real but my daughter was absolutely terrified and was screaming and crying, she was traumatised. There were a lot of kids there who were also screaming and sobbing and trying to hide from it all.
I went to complain to the staff after who were not at all bothered by the sight of my sobbing and traumatised daughter. I got told lots of kids love it and it does state not suitable for under 5’s. But if I had any idea it was about dangerous and venomous creatures I’d never have taken my daughter in. It’s not suitable for kids at all, it’s frightening and unnecessary. They could have made it into a lovely film about animals and been educational too. But the aim is to absolutely terrify children. You have been warned. My little girl had awful nightmares last night since we saw it.
Most of the staff are rude and unfriendly. A lot of places there either close early or don’t open at all for half the week.

37,272,Arundel,Accommodation,0,"Lunch at The Norfolk Arms Myself and a couple of family visited the Norfolk Arms for Lunch whilst attending the Bank Holiday celebrations. It was a glorious day and we took advantage of the outside garden at the rear of the hotel. Nice location with confortable seating.
Menus were delivered quickly and we decided to go for a selection of the light bite dishes.
Within minutes of our order being taken we were delivered some really tasty food.
Tender pork marinated in a zingy Malaysian style sauce, fish goujons with tarter sauce and mushy pea dips, prawns with marie rose sauce and chicken satay skewers with two dips. As is customery when my family dine out we also had a bowl of triple cooked chips.
It was meat to be a light lunch, but there was a serious amount of food as you can see by the pictures and it was simply delicious.
We all had our favouites but for me the chicken skewers were fantastic. The chicken was lovely and moist and the sauces superb.
Everything was hot and well presented in different dishes.
Looking at the menu there was so much more we could have had and we'll certainly be back to try some of the other dishes on there.
Might even try the hotel soon for an evening meal if that is the standard of the food.
Who knows maybe even book for xmas if I'm impressed next time.

This was after placing the order as the waiter didn’t know where the dish was on his tablet then came back. She was advised that if she wanted the shrimp as well it had to be the starter??? Made no sense...

Drinks took ages (had to ask), food took ages (had to ask) then I sent my chicken and waffles back as it was over cooked, dry and burnt (see the photos). The bacon tasted of charcoal, the chicken breast was dry and chewy... even the waffle was crispy and overdone. How it cleared the pass I have no idea, but a replacement came out quite quickly so I assume I was given someone else’s dish. Sorry to whoever that was!!

91,193,Littlehampton,Food,1,"Worst Sunday lunch ever. Well - I have just returned home at the end of a day when my family and I experienced what must be one of the worst lunch experiences ever.

We arrived at 1.20pm for a 1.30pm booking and were shown to our table. Finally someone took our drinks order at around 1.45pm and the drinks arrived at 1.55pm at which time we were informed that due to lack of kitchen staff it would be another half hour before they could take our food order and then maybe about half an hour more before we would be served. We were asked if we wanted to stay (bear in mind we had just got our drinks) and knowing that it was nearly 2pm and there was probably no chance of getting a table elsewhere we decided to bite the bullet and stay - as long as we weren't charged for the drinks. Which they agreed to.

Our food order was actually taken at around 2.15pm and we waited for our food. And waited and waited and waited. And waited. We complained to the management who, I'm afraid to say, were decidedly unconcerned. In fact I would say that the owner was actually rude in his response. ""Oh, It's coming. It's coming"" he said - as if that was enough.

Finally the food arrived at 3.15pm! One and three quarter hours after the time of our booking. Needless to say, by this time, my family were starving, losing the will to live and almost willing to accept anything. The meals were more or less OK except for one beef dinner which was almost cold. We were offered free desserts but to be honest we just wanted to leave as soon as possible.

If only we had been told about their staffing problems when we first arrived instead of after half an hour we would have had a better chance of finding a lunch elsewhere. I'm afraid that if this is the usual attitude of the owners then they are in for a rough ride in the pub business.

However, those are the only compliments I can mention about this place. We had called and booked and on arrival were shown to a good sized table this is where our evening swiftly went downhill.

The bar-man came over to our table after we had sat waiting for about 20 minutes and begrudgingly said ‘I suppose you would like some drinks’ he took our order, rolled his eyes and went off to make them- clearly a hassle to him!

A further amount of time passed and a lady came over to take our orders. They had mussels on the specials board, which I asked if they could make a starter size portion, if not I would have the Brie. She huffed and puffed and argued it would then be hassle to sell the remaining portion. To which I totally understood and said the Brie would be fine.

After about half an hour our starters came out, thus the mussels were cold and very little accompanying mariniere sauce in the bowl.

We ordered a burger and fish and chips for our mains. The burger deemed to be beef, but tasted rather rubbery, was a weird burgundy colour and on the cheap side. Coleslaw, was very watery and chips very oily!

The fish batter was also very oily and peas crunchy!

The food is average pub grub, the staff however are rude and the whole atmosphere was clicky. No one came to check how our food was. No one even said goodbye nor thank you when we left.

174,911,Arundel,Food,1,"Upsetting experience. When we arrived at the Town House we felt it did not appear as bright and cheerfyul as it does in the photographs. We also found the tables too close together. We were allocated a table at the bar end, in front of a passageway with a view of the unisex toilet door.
My pate-de-foie terrine turned out to be just a small portion of pate which was okay but nothing special. My husband's scallops starter was nicely cooked. My main course of half a lobster was also nicely cooked. Sadly my husband's surf and turf was overcooked and cold. The waiter returned it to the kitchen and the same meal came back re-heated and even more overcooked. The glass of champagne was nice as was the half bottle of Chablis. The waiter was efficient and friendly.
We had made this booking using a voucher from 'Gourmet Vouchers. Our son had given this to us as a present for a special occasion. When we came to pay the bill - which had come to £32 more than the £100 voucher - the problems started. The restaurant had received only £50 from Gourmet Vouchers instead of the £100. This was entirely the fault of Gourmet Vouchers who telephoned my husband the following morning to apologise and to pay the restaurant the balance. We gave the restaurant the receipt for the payment to Gourmet Vouchers expecting them to deal with the problem. The manager told us we would have to deal with it and wanted us to pay another £50 then claim this back from Gournet Vouchers. As they had offered us no proof that they had received only £50, but we had provided them with proof that the voucher was for £100 we refused (leaving our contact details) but paid the rest of the bill in cash. Unfortunately this meant we had no cash to give the waiter the gratuity he deserved. The manager loudly argued that they did not have to take Gourmet Vouchers at all - they do their own vouchers - and behaved as though they had done us a big favour by taking it when they accepted our booking. As we left nobody opened the door for us nor wished us a 'good evening'.
The problems ruined our evening......we could forgive the 'not quite up to scratch' meal but as it was a special occasion for us we would have liked to leave the restaurant with a memory of a happy evening. Instead we left disappointed, embarrassed and rather upset.

175,17,Arundel,Attractions,1,"Disappointing half term activity We visited in the February half term lured in by the ‘puddle jumping championship’ which sounded ideal for my young children who are obsessed with muddly puddles. What we found was a large, unorganised queue of families and a plastic tray with an inch of water in it. After waiting 15 minutes the children were allowed 1 jump in the plastic tray then scored out of 100 and given a sticker. The staff were trying to make it a bit more exciting but this wasn’t really possible given the circumstances. We had high hopes of a puddle assault course where children could play and splash freely rather than regimented queuing for 1 jump. Not worth wrestling them into the puddlesuit for. There was, however, a much larger natural puddle just round the corner which they enjoyed far more. This ‘event’ needs a rethink.
The boat trip however was excellent and a lovely way to end an otherwise disappointing day for the children.

179,24,Bognor,Attractions,0,"Alice's Vegetable pies deter Hitler A splendid, little, quirky museum with lots of things of interest to me. The first thing I noticed was an 1897 playbill (for “Madcap Madge”, which I somehow must have missed when it came to Bath). I have never noticed this before but the list of characters included lines spoken by them - very useful for those theatregoers such as myself, who have a tendency to doze through performances - so we had one character who said “Blessed is he who expects nothing”, but another had the depressing line, “Time, please.” (hopefully not the heroine)
Then on to “Alice’s (wartime) Kitchen” where you can listen to her talk about her delicious vegetable pies and dried egg concoctions. I was intrigued to know that the BBC Home Service regularly broadcast an 8.15-8.20 wartime slot called “The Kitchen Front” giving advice to housewives just before they went out for the “morning shop”. (None of the weekly supermarket shop nonsense in those days!) However, Alice must have been telling little fibs - or perhaps her memory is not so good these days - when she spoke of later listening to “Life With the Lyons” on the wireless, as this didn’t start until 1950.
A photograph reminded me that my favourite comedian, Tony Hancock, had filmed “The Punch and Judy Man” in Bognor Regis. As a devoted fan, I have previously stayed in his parents’ old hotel in Bournemouth.
I also enjoyed the room full of old wirelesses, memories of being a kid, bouncing a ball around the living room and breaking the screen on my parents’ old “Philco” came flooding back, although the collection at the museum in Droitwich - those were the days for wireless transmission! - is probably more extensive.
A sign told me that beer was “watered down” during World War 1 - not sure whether this was landlords making their supplies stretch a bit, or it was by government decree - but the thought that “being drunk was seen as being unpatriotic” seems a bit harsh after spending all that cash on weak beer. (Personally, I’m still following the directive about “no-one being allowed to buy a round a drinks.”)
Altogether, very enjoyable and lots of fun!

Booked a pedicure for my daughter and me as a birthday treat.
Asked when booking and paying that we could be together and could we have a glass of fizz or a cuppa.
On arrival we had seconds to choose a polish colour but told not to use the swatch as not all lours available.
Then we were taken off to separate rooms and it was at this point I was told that they have no facility for two people together.
Pedicure was done with me lying down so not sure how I could have sipped fizz or a cuppa!
During the application of the the nail polish I was told it was too thick to continue as the bottle was nearly finished. They did not have any more. The beautician then added something to dilute it.
There was no option for gel polish so we were told to wait in a dark cold room for 45 minutes until we could put our shoes back on.
I feel that £126 was not reflected in the quality or experience.
I did phone to explain my issues. After several days and a second call the manager finally called me back. I don’t think customer satisfaction was a priority.
I will never go back and would not recommend this to anyone.
I would not have put a bad review if the response had been better.
