0,6,0,Bognor,4,"Nice break, shame about the accommodation... We booked our 3 night stay from 27-30 December as a post-Christmas treat for the family (2 adults, 2 kids, 4 and 5.5 years old).

We’d never been to Butlins before so weren’t really sure what to expect and had read reviews which were either really good or terrible, so just decided to book and make up our own minds – plus it was cheaper at this time of year than our usual choices of either Haven or Centreparcs.

First impressions weren’t good –we arrived and parked in the car park to discover that our ‘apartment’ was the furthest distance away of all the accommodation. Bearing in mind that people in the apartments are obviously self-catering, and will therefore have a ton of stuff to haul to the room, you’d think they’d make some parking available nearer that part of the resort (or at least some temporary parking so you can offload nearer to your room). So, we had to do 2 trips back and forth from one side of the resort to the other, balancing our stuff on the airport-style trollies which had been left scattered around the car park. Not the most relaxing start to the weekend.

The ‘standard apartment’ should maybe get a name change to ‘basic apartment’ as that would more accurately describe it. We made our way to the apartment, located in what I can only describe as rows of very dated apartment buildings, almost prison-like in their style, complete with paint peeling off the outer walls, doors etc. Having got past the other apartments and their new owners for the weekend, most of whom were busily smoking away in the doorways (there are designated smoking areas on the site but these were mostly ignored going by what we saw over the 3 days we were there). We got into the ‘apartment’ (which is pushing it really – ‘bedsit’ might be a better description) and were hit immediately by the smell of tobacco smoke and, in the kids room, the unmistakable smell of weed. The grill in the cooker was partly broken and was hanging down into the oven and there was mildew/mould on the crumbling window sills. No towels were provided (although we already knew this, but it’s still a basic thing that’s provided in most resorts these days). A complaint was made and the grill was eventually fixed although it was only my wife’s decision to bring a scented candle with us that helped with the smell of the place.

The apartment itself is basic, with the usual things you need (plates, cups, cutlery, tea/coffee, toaster etc.), although a cheese grater might have been useful (a minor gripe but still would’ve been good). The floor throughout the apartment was uneven and ‘bumpy’, illustrated by the fact that we put a toy car on the table between the kids’ beds and it rolled all the way off it in 2 seconds. Yes, these buildings really ARE old!

Anyway, from here on things get better, so we just used the apartment as a place to spend as little time as possible and got out and about instead. There are loads of things to do on the resort, with all sorts of entertainment available for the kids throughout the day (arcades, shows, character meets/photo opportunities, playgrounds, outdoor funfair (free), go karts (£6 per car), zipwire etc.) plus the beach (pebbles, no sand) is right outside, to the rear of the site.

The evening entertainment was very good, with the Redcoats’ enthusiasm unwavering – the kids were engaged and entertained on all 3 nights, with their favourite being the animal show on the last night, which was very good and they enjoyed the disco part of the evening too. However, the queues to get in (and therefore to bag the best seats/tables in whichever venue you’re going to in the evening) start early and the die-hards get themselves in the queue about 30 mins or more before doors open at 7pm. If you’re not one of them, you’ll have to be happy with a seat at the back of the big room.

The absolute highlight of the weekend, however, was the swimming pool, including the spacious changing area. You can tell where all the money has been spent lately (god knows it’s not the apartments), as the swimming pool is fantastic. Having two under 6’s, the tallest of which is about 115cm, there was only one slide of the 5 or 6 available that they couldn’t go on (the height limit on the biggest slide is 120cm with a minimum age restriction of 8), which was a very welcome surprise. The slides, including the ‘rapids’ which take you outside (albeit undercover) and then back in were a real hit with our kids – one can swim, the other still needs a buoyancy vest – and they said that was their favourite of the slides. My only note on this would be that on the 2nd day we went in (at the same time of day as the first, around 3.30pm), it was way too busy and the wave pool seemed dangerously overcrowded. However, for all the complaints about other aspects of the resort, I have to be fair here and admit they’ve absolutely nailed this part.

We didn’t try any of the dining out places as we just cooked for ourselves, but the range and number of places available seems to be very good, although the on-site supermarket was very low on things when we went and the prices are a bit steep (they obviously assume you won’t be bothered to go elsewhere) - you’re better off going out to the huge Sainsbury’s a couple of minutes down the road.

So, overall it was a good break based on the fact that the kids had a good time (and as all parents will know, if the kids are happy it makes the holiday so much better). Basically, the accommodation is, at absolute best, basic and just about tolerable. It’s the entertainment and activities which make it (and which made this a 4 star review rather than 3). If they spend some serious money on repairing/updating the apartments and making them and that part of the resort more attractive/liveable, it would make the place so much better.

2,15,3,Bognor,5,"Christmas  Just got home a few days ago from our first Christmas away from home and have to say it was a great time!! I was concerned it wouldn't feel like Christmas but no chance of that happening! Everyone makes a huge effort there to keep the Christmas spirit going the whole time and the extras like the selection boxes, reindeer food and table cloth and crackers in the room were just so lovely.

We stayed in one of the oyster bay apartments which is totally adequate for us, there was 5 of us (2 adults, 2 teenagers and 2 year old) so we had three bedrooms and plenty of space. It's not the Ritz but I didn't pay for that so dont expect it! Was comfortable and clean. The showers are very small but we all managed just fine.

The shows were brilliant, especially the panto on boxing day and we love the new pool!

Thank you butlins for a great time!

3,25,9,Bognor,3,"The Butlins experience We previously been to butlins minehead in may 2019 and i loved it.

My parents wanted to go over xmas so my wife and i agreed (we both over 40) even though neither of us celebrate xmas.

We arrived on 23rd december and were greeted with mull wine and mince pie. Check in was effortless we arrived 1pm and our rooms were ready.

We were in silver and rooms were amazing. We didnt have a tv remote and one was provided very fast.

We had food court and the food was good, not amazing. Plenty of variety and glass of wine each night.

Xmas day the staff did the tables up amazing. As stated before we dont celebrate xmas but the amount of effort the staff put in to decorate tables and make us feel welcome was amazing

The staff were amazing. I doubt they wanted to work xmas day etc but they never showed it.

I loved the pool, got busy at times, long queues for raft slide but think the resort was at capacity.

Fireworks were amazing best i have seen very professional.

The added extras at butlins is annoying. Archery £8, go karts £6, pool £6 and list goes on. Wish they did a ""all in"" package

Beer was £4-£5 which is quite reasonable.

We avoided the xmas shows but the other shows were very professional. We had seen them in may as same shows. Hope they change them for next year

My only complaint was that on the late show the redcoats stand in front of the stage. On abba my view was totally blocked all show (i was on the front row). When i complained i was told they have to be there. The redcoat stayed in same spot.

Also the dancefloor is right in front of the stage and we had adults just standing watching the show. My 78 old dad couldn't see anything either.

Ironically on the first evening show children are encouraged to sit down in front of stage or sit with parents.

In minehead they also do this for both shows

I complained direct to butlins via email and they wanted my full name and booking reference for a general feedback.

They also don't control people being loud or drunk which we had on the last night when women behind us sang every single lyric very loudly.

The shows are so professional and this really spoilt it.

5,29,10,Bognor,2,"From our point of view.. It wasn't for us. I am coming at this from a mum of a 3 year old who we usually take to centre parcs.
first off some of the staff were amazing and I hope this review dosen't put the place in much of a bad light, but at the same time let me explain why it was not a good holiday for us.
First of all the ""schedule"" compared to CP yes there are activities which are scheduled... BUT dose the pool have to be so ridged in its times during a tots week? CP are open all day every day with food and drink available... with a swimming mad son... and this being his only really love at the place it gave us little to do the rest of time...
You might be think ahh there are shows.. rides, slot machines, activities, stuff to do around the park... well... Not for us..
Son didn't like the rides, didn't like the shows and the slot machines (which I really wasn't happy with... introduce your child to gambling... emmmmmm...) 30 mins at the most of entertainment. The winter break and constant rain meant we were stuck inside the resort and thus we exhausted the craft activity was left craving to go home. The one show we did take him too ended up scaring him...
He could not go on the big soft play because of the height restriction
The bed was dirty on arrival (They changed it right away)
The pool changing area could have offered overshoes.
We ended up coming home early and little one was sick and then my husband and I came down with it 2 days later...
Having been to CP both UK and Belgium they seem to offer less yet we get so much more out of the holiday. Maybe its because we really don't like that type of entertainment. I have left feedback with them... we had a reply, which they didnt address my issue over the gambling aspect of the site. wont be going there again.

6,35,17,Bognor,4,"Tots festive break Having visited Butlin’s a few years ago which was great, I had high expectations for our mid week break, our accommodation in the shoreline was really good and suited us as a family. We liked the pool thou the air temperature was a little cold at times, but that couldn’t be helped due to outside temp. It wasn’t overly busy in the afternoon and the changing rooms are lovely an clean.

I do feel there could have been more entertainment on the skyline stage as a lot was repeated during the week and not all children will sit through the shows on the main stage.

I highly recommend eating at the diner as food was fantastic, even thou the waitress could have been better, I felt we was processed rather than served and had a dining experience, but don’t let that stop you for going.

Parts of butlins is starting to look tired but overall still a good experience for children

7,37,19,Bognor,4,"Christmas @ Butlins After being a little apprehensive about staying at Butlins I have to say I have been so impressed. We stayed in a seaside apartment, there was 3 adults and 3 children. The apartment was clean and very comfortable, the decor was nice and the layout was brilliant. Lots of space and not too far from check-in and resort.
There was loads to do for our kids, the Santa experience, shows, activities, restaurants, parks, fairground, it was everything they needed. I like that you didn't have to pay to do extras as with 3 kids it becomes too much for us then. The waterpark is brilliant, we've done lots of water parks and it's probably one of the beast we've been to. The kids loved it and there was things for our 5 year old and 10 year old so good balance. The staff have been brilliant, there is people everywhere; when we arrived we were greeted by people at every corner making sure we knew where to do. They had our pack ready and had organised our times for the Christamas events really well. We asked to change our santa visit and the lady was happy to do that for us. Its fairly busy but it's been managed well. We are very impressed, well done @butlins!

8,56,28,Bognor,1,"awful accommodation We booked the Seaside apartment this time having been to another part of the site a year and a half before. My grandson is 3 (one and a half last time) and my daughter thought The Seaside apartments sounded nice - don't be fooled like we were.We went in October half term as my other daughter and grandaughter have a different half term to other areas of the country. When we arrived at the apartment we started to unpack the few groceries we had brought with us - I felt quite queasy as the dining table started to move (unstable). everywhere felt sticky and the veneer (if you can call it that) had started to peel off. My grandson's white socks soon became very dirty and slipper bottoms were tacky. We could hardly get into the bathroom (you almost had to get into the shower to get through the door) and we had to call out maintenance twice as the contents of the toilet and sink would not empty and started to fill up. The outside drains had to be rodded. Our front door would not shut properly on a couple of occasions and the windows of the rooms were very poor - condensation and we could not leave the window on the catch to ventilate and the lounge window hinge was buckled. Our friends also had a similar appartment and they left a day early (there were 3 in their group but 6 in ours). We did have a power cut which took out most of the surrounding area and I have to say the staff in the fish restaurant were a delight and kept reasuring us (fortunately we ordered before the power went off so we got our meal). I have already been in touch with a higher authority to complain but I felt I was being patronised and it was if the lady who responded was pacifing me with answers off a script. There was no offer of compensation only that if we were to go again they could offer a discount (we could probably get that by booking on line anyway). It has totally put me off Butlins and sad to say that my 3 year old grandson will probably miss out on family visits like this in the future - there must be other wonderful sites out there.

Still a fab weekend and we got to see Nick Heyward, China Crisis, Blancmange, Altered Images, Howard Jones, Art of What (which included some original members) & Jimi Somerville perform some of their 80's hits. The tribute bands were good quality. There was DJ's, Disco and a Silent Disco aswell as bars and food outlets. Would definitely recommend to anyone into 80's live music.

We stayed at the shoreline hotel on a premium buffet plan. The 3 night stay cost around £425 and the premium dining plan cost £250 so paid £675 in total. I will keep it brief. Upon arrival we managed around 4:30pm we managed to find parking close to the hotel. Checkin went smoothly and the staff were amazing. The shoreline hotel is catered more for under 5 year old with a sea themed room. The room we stayed in was on the 1st floor no. 119 overlooking the car park. It had a separate room with a bunk bed however the room was not enclosed but had a curtain. The room itself had a mini fridge hairdryer but only 1 plug socket that o was suprised about. Makesure you bring an extension lead. The shoreline is conveniently situated in between the splash pool which was a 2 min walk and skyline pavilion 3 min walk. You had the shop fish and chips papa johns within 2 min walk. Nothing was ever too far to get to. We dined in the deck during our stay as we were informed by a friend that it was the best restaurant in terms of space and comfort. The buffet food was good and was varied during our stay. I decided not to risk eating elsewhere as I wasn’t overly impressed with the menus. Please note that you can only eat breakfast at the hotel your staying in even if your on a dining plan. Not that it mattered as breakfast was probably tasted the same in all hotels.
Makesure you book your free activities upon arrival. I didn’t do this and when I tried the next morning I was told all the main free activities were fully booked. However I did manage to get my daughters booked onto fencing and archery. To be honest they weren’t great.
The panto was sleeping beauty which was ok. Makesure you que up 30 mins before every show starts and if your having photos shoots in order to get a decent seat. Basically arrive 30 mins before any show. It gets filled up quickly. The splash pool was probably the highlight of the kids stay. It is a very nice pool with warm water. There is a lot catered for all ages however adults are only allowed to go on the helter skelter, flume, rapids, and the fast one (can’t remember the name). The fairground was ok with only a handful of rides. We were the lucky few who had booked the character breakfast at papa johns with billie and bonnie. It was amazing. The kids had a cuddle and dance. Also the fireworks was good. Fair play to butlins for going ahead with it despite the fact it was raining. The cirque du hilarious show was very funny and enjoyable. There is something always happening at the resort so you will not get bored however the activities are repeated each day. My only qualm is that because there are soo many people on the resort you do find it difficult to get a good seat at the shows as you have granny’s queuing up reserving 3 tables etc. It does appear that butlins over subscribes. Overall the holiday itself was good, staff were amazing and kids loved it. I am not sure if I will be returning in a hurry as it does take a lot out of you as you constantly on the move. I would recommend you try it the once to experience it. If you have children over 5 then I’d recommend you stay at the Wave or Ocean hotel. One last thing we ate at papa johns on our last day and the food was amazing and cheaper than normal. We didn’t go for the buffet as we are not huge eaters. If i was to go again I would probably just opt to have breakfast included and eat at the variety of restaurants onsite as they are all reasonably priced and you probably would end up making a saving.

13,79,48,Bognor,5,"Visit over Halloween Well well well...after deliberating for years whether or not I should pay a visit to Butlins after reading lots of positive and negative reviews, I decided to visit over Halloween weekend (25th Oct) with my three young daughters aged 7,4 and 1. We stayed at the shoreline hotel on a premium buffet plan. The 3 night stay cost around £425 and the premium dining plan cost £250 so paid £675 in total. I will keep it brief. Upon arrival we managed around 4:30pm we managed to find parking close to the hotel. Checkin went smoothly and the staff were amazing. The shoreline hotel is catered more for under 5 year old with a sea themed room. The room we stayed in was on the 1st floor no. 119 overlooking the car park. It had a separate room with a bunk bed however the room was not enclosed but had a curtain. The room itself had a mini fridge hairdryer but only 1 plug socket that o was suprised about. Makesure you bring an extension lead. The shoreline is conveniently situated in between the splash pool which was a 2 min walk and skyline pavilion 3 min walk. You had the shop fish and chips papa johns within 2 min walk. Nothing was ever too far to get to. We dined in the deck during our stay as we were informed by a friend that it was the best restaurant in terms of space and comfort. The buffet food was good and was varied during our stay. I decided not to risk eating elsewhere as I wasn’t overly impressed with the menus. Please note that you can only eat breakfast at the hotel your staying in even if your on a dining plan. Not that it mattered as breakfast was probably tasted the same in all hotels.
Makesure you book your free activities upon arrival. I didn’t do this and when I tried the next morning I was told all the main free activities were fully booked. However I did manage to get my daughters booked onto fencing and archery. To be honest they weren’t great.
The panto was sleeping beauty which was ok. Makesure you que up 30 mins before every show starts and if your having photos shoots in order to get a decent seat. Basically arrive 30 mins before any show. It gets filled up quickly. The splash pool was probably the highlight of the kids stay. It is a very nice pool with warm water. There is a lot catered for all ages however adults are only allowed to go on the helter skelter, flume, rapids, and the fast one (can’t remember the name). The fairground was ok with only a handful of rides. We were the lucky few who had booked the character breakfast at papa johns with billie and bonnie. It was amazing. The kids had a cuddle and dance. Also the fireworks was good. Fair play to butlins for going ahead with it despite the fact it was raining. The cirque du hilarious show was very funny and enjoyable. There is something always happening at the resort so you will not get bored however the activities are repeated each day. My only qualm is that because there are soo many people on the resort you do find it difficult to get a good seat at the shows as you have granny’s queuing up reserving 3 tables etc. It does appear that butlins over subscribes. Overall the holiday itself was good, staff were amazing and kids loved it. I am not sure if I will be returning in a hurry as it does take a lot out of you as you constantly on the move. I would recommend you try it the once to experience it. If you have children over 5 then I’d recommend you stay at the Wave or Ocean hotel. One last thing we ate at papa johns on our last day and the food was amazing and cheaper than normal. We didn’t go for the buffet as we are not huge eaters. If i was to go again I would probably just opt to have breakfast included and eat at the variety of restaurants onsite as they are all reasonably priced and you probably would end up making a saving.

Great atmosphere/dancing. An older age group of predominantly age 40+ . Accommodation was clean and a good standard. We booked during a 40% off special offer which made it good value (around £420 between 4 of us in self catering apartment) . I don't think it would be worth the around £800 full price.

17,106,61,Bognor,3,"Poor value and inconsistent This was our 4th time coming to Butlins Bognor in 2 years and I’m not sure we will come back. We have a 7yo boy and 4yo autistic boy. They loved previous stays hence the decision to come again.

Accommodation
We previously stayed at the Shoreline hotel which is great for families with young kids. It is close to Skyline, all the activities and now Splash. Rooms were lovely and the only issue we had last time was the change in their housekeeping policy (they change towels only once during your stay). It was otherwise great if you go for the hotel dining option. We stayed twice in May and once during Easter.

This time we stayed Monday to Friday during the October half term and stayed in standard accommodation. We weren’t expecting much and accepted there will be basic amenities, however cleanliness is a must. Unfortunately toilets were extremely dirty in both, It was disgusting. The glasses were also dirty with hair inside them so we had to wash them. General cleanliness was poor, thankfully beds were fine otherwise we would not have managed. We bit our lips and stayed in order to not upset our boys. Handwash should be mandatory, we had to buy some. Wardrobes could not be used as there were no hangers. Only 2 toilet rolls were provided for a 4 night stay, we required double that. Our rooms were in the 3rd row of Oyster Bay which was pretty close to Skyline but can be very noisy at times and neighbours voices/tv can be heard very clearly.

Splash Waterworld
Great upgrade. This was the highlight for us and the only reason we would consider returning. Wave pool was slightly cold at times and jacuzzis were very cold, otherwise water was a good temperature especially in shallow (kids) areas. The queue to the Family Raft ride was very long, which posed a barrier due to our child being autistic. Butlins should consider a virtual queuing system or something similar (such as being provided an allocated time) to allow all customers to benefit from the ride. The racer and stick of rock slides were suitable for over 90cm height but restricted to under 18 year olds - due to the number of steps, there is a safety risk of allowing a small child to climb up by themselves so they need to be accompanied, however another adult also needs to be waiting at the bottom of the slides for when the child comes off - this meant that 2 adults were required to each child to benefit from this. Either parents of small children should be able to go on the slide at the same time as them or more lifeguards should be in the stairs area in case a child falls. Our boys loved these slides and we were able to manage this by me going up with them and their down staying at the bottom. The wave in the wave pool was good fun though there were often a lot of people which restricted movement, kids had a blast hitting the waves. There are smaller slides for younger toddlers and there is a small swimming area (again packed) for grown ups. Overall the new pool is a really great upgrade for kids and families.
The changing area floor was very dirty and requires more regular cleaning. Heated floor was great and there were plenty of lockers. The clothes dryers were a great idea however there should be more as there was a massive queue for them.

Food & Dining
Previously dined at Shoreline hotel which was fantastic. We selected the premium dining package this time and were allocated to the Yacht club. This was despite being told by advisor on the phone that we will have a choice between The Deck and Yacht Club. When paying for premium dining online, it also states choice of 2 restaurants and, under the information about premium dining on the website, it also mentions the choice between The Deck and Yacht club. In reality, anyone staying in standard accommodation is not given the choice and is not allocated to The Deck restaurant. We were allocated to the Yacht and it was poor standard. There was also very little choice. We had also spoken to the Chef prior to our visit to ensure our dietary requirements would be met, however it still was not. Previously we had the choice of halal lamb and chicken, now only chicken is apparently provided but even that was not available. We have a child with allergies and there were absolutely no protein options. Other issue we had with Yacht was the distance from our accommodation and having to go through the Skyline which led to meltdowns from our autistic son.

We spoke with Guest Services and were told we could therefore eat breakfast at The Deck, however this was not communicated and the staff held us up and the manager acted aggressively towards us when we showed up. She said she also has an autistic child so it is even more disappointing she was not more understanding. We were offered dinner at the Shoreline and in contrast they were expecting us, had reserved a table, cooked specifically for our child who has allergies and were very welcoming and hospitable. The difference between the service and food quality was like night and day despite Yacht and The Deck providing “premium” dining. It wasn’t cheap and we will not be picking the dining option again. I understand due to practicalities people may have to be allocated to certain restaurants, however this should be made explicitly clear on the website and by customer service agents (they need to have the correct knowledge) and the food quality and choice should be the same if the price being paid is the same. For families with specific medical issues (eg. having an autistic child, allergies) this should be taken into consideration. If Butlins cannot accommodate something, they need to be clear.

Entertainment
Skyline shows were much better than the ones on Centre Stage / Reds this year which were poor in quality especially in comparison to the last 2 years. Only show we enjoyed was wrestling. Having an autistic child meant we were not able to benefit from good seating as we could not queue. The view was restricted and it also wasn’t possible to keep our child engaged throughout the show. Having the shop next to Centre stage also meant our child was distracted by this and we were therefore only able to watch snippets of the shows and had to leave early. The holiday is already very expensive and so buying B-line passes was not an option especially as there is also a queue for that. Its a shame Butlins don’t have a more inclusive approach.

Soft play
There is an area for kids over 1m where adults are not allowed - our 4yo was therefore not able to benefit from this as he could not cope by himself. Our 7yo enjoyed it but it was hard to see him and we had to wait ages to spot him and ask him to come out. The other soft play area was available to kids under 1m, however there were a lot of older kids inside and it was packed. On the very first day, he was pushed by an older child and that scared him such that he did not want to go on the soft play area throughout the holiday. We tried to encourage him every day to try again with no luck. On the 4th day, a member of staff came in and asked all children over 1m to go out. In the past, this was one of his favourite activities and there should be better guidelines and supervision of this area.

Indoor fairground
The queues were very short and our kids managed to enjoy these. These rides are more suited for younger kids. The staff were great and very welcoming. My son nearly had a meltdown when trying to put on the seatbelt and the staff member was so considerate and helped him adjust the seatbelt so he was able to do it. They were high fiving the kids which they loved.

Outdoor fairground
There are only a handful of rides, kids enjoyed them especially the Helter Skelter. There is a height restriction of 90cm/1m which my kids were over. In the past, they weren’t able to ride on all the rides.

Activities
Previously there were a lot of activities including Balanceabililty which my kids enjoyed. Only two options available this time was Mini Bow and Fencing. The slots get booked fast, you have to book on the first day as soon as you arrive to have any chance. There are a lot of chargeable activities - my eldest enjoyed the bungee jumping and go karts.

Staff
Apart from the rude manager at the Deck, all other staff were professional, friendly and understanding.

In conclusion, we wouldn’t consider coming again unless we stayed at a hotel but prices during school holidays are steep so it is looking doubtful. There are too many problems associated with the budget accommodation.

20,131,74,Bognor,3,"Good fun but dirty apartment  We’ve just returned from a 4 night stay and although we had a great time, the apartment wasn’t up to scratch in terms of cleanliness.

When we arrived it was pouring down and we had to walk the other side of the resort with our bags on a luggage trolley to get to our apartment. We were located in the last apartment block in Oyster Bay. The pavements are all uneven and slanted in places making it especially difficult to keep the trolley straight without all of your luggage falling off. There should be somewhere where you can park to unload before moving your car to the main car park. By the time we got to our apartment we were all soaked and there was nowhere to hang our wet coats which was frustrating.

Our apartment had not been cleaned very well at all. The cutlery was dirty with dried food still caked on, glasses had been put away still wet, the oven tray hadn’t been cleaned properly and the oven stunk the whole apartment out when turned on. The carpet looked like it had been hoovered in a rush as there was still bits of fluff everywhere and there rubbish under the sofa (not even at the back of the sofa where it would be more difficult to get to). This was especially annoying as we have a 10 month old who spends most of her time on the floor. The fridge/freezer had been turned off so when we arrived there was a big puddle of water all over the kitchen floor. The fridge and freezer were also filled with water. The remote control was greasy, my hands were actually greasy after touching it.

There were a lot of little things wrong with the apartment such as the bedding was torn, the veneers were hanging off the bedroom furniture, and the TV had big black spots in the top and bottom corners. The extractor fan and towel rail in the bathroom weren’t working and the water that came out of the taps was scolding. There were no signs to warn you either. The walls were so thin that you could hear everything from the apartment next door. The person next to us snored so loud that I may has well have been in the bed with them. If I hadn’t already unpacked all of the bags and could be bothered with the hassle I would have been asking to move. Unfortunately we didn’t notice all of these problems at once, they cropped up. Top and bottom line is the apartment has everything you need and is an OK size but it wasn’t clean.

The entertainment was great, the splash pool is amazing and all of the staff are really friendly and helpful. I’d read a few comments regarding how expensive it is on site but to be honest I didn’t think it was that bad. £1.70 for a bottle of Diet Coke and a ‘luxury gelato’ ice cream was £2.40 which I think is about what you’d pay anywhere else. The toy shop is also reasonably priced.

Despite all of the issues regarding the apartment we would go again, however if we do we’ll be checking the apartment out a lot more thoroughly before unpacking. Reading some of the other reviews we may have to check out the Skegness resort instead.

Our standard apartment was in oyster bay, it was adequate and clean.
I see people complaining about utensils, did you ask for what you needed because we did and they were brought to us an hour later.
We didn’t do a dining plan but paid as we went, the food could have been a bit better quality, we ate at the pub and kitchen, beachcomber inn and papa johns. It was ok but nothing to write home about.
The cocktails are nice but don’t get a pitcher as actually worked out you got less for your money.
Overall all the stuff on for tots week was great value. Free fairground rides were a bonus indoors my son really had a great time. We have booked to come back for March next year with friends and their little one too.

As for food on the complex.....chips dry as old bones from the ‘traditional chip shop’ , pub stops food at 9pm, not everyone likes eating pizza and burgers, the diner not open at 8pm....did it even open?? Where are people meant to eat after 9pm? Burger King or papa johns just are not acceptable choices?!?!? Considering this is a holiday why does butlins shut/stop so early?? It’s ridiculous...adults are kept in line with the children and so called adult entertainment is abysmal....for example skyline ended tonight at 8.15 pm, the cafe there wasn’t open at 7.15pm when we walked round.....not even a chance of a coffee and centre stage ended at 10.15pm, as I’m not a drinker I have no desire to sit in bar Rosso...so off we go home to bed as nothing else to do.....a nice early night to get up early and look forward to a load of nothing again.....I remember when butlins was really good, kids had a great time, you could get a coffee with ease in the evening, you can’t even walk round in the skyline and have a look in the gift shops or sweet shop as they all close at silly o’clock....the cinema is no more it’s now a left luggage place.....seems to me butlins can palm the kids off with rubbish entertainment as kids accept any old crap.....adults don’t, so we won’t be back.....the most happiest member of staff I met was the litter picker man on the Monday nice friendly happy old chap....now....what is this smoking area ‘thing’, designated areas, it’s like we are being treated like 2nd class citizens the way these smoking places are positioned.....yes smoking is anti social but you have taken it to the extreme, as for one of your funfair workers lecturing me about if I smoke by the rides he will be telling me off and him finding it funny how the smokers are hidden in the ridiculous smoking area by the ice cream shop.....really?!?!?! I do not expect to be spoken to by one of your staff like that.....my holiday wasn’t free gratis and I don’t expect hostility because I smoke.....you need to up your game all round in my opinion

24,143,82,Bognor,5,"The 1 metre rule is extremely harsh Our 3rd visit to this particular resort with my wife and 2 boys (1 almost 3 and the other 8 months) and every time we’ve loved it. We’re planning our 4th visit in May 2020.

Rain or shine there is plenty to do from play doh sessions, fairground, indoor rides to soft play There’s also a fantastic swimming centre on site.

Unfortunately, under their strict insurance guidelines, your child must be atleast 1 metre tall to go in the big softplay and certain other rides including the river rapids. My almost 3 year old, who measured 98cm was not granted permission to go in the big softplay or river rapids which we found extremely harsh and we believe this needs reviewing and should be down to parental consent if you’re over 90cm.

For one reason or another they won’t let adults over 18 on two slides in the swimming centre too and this is a new rule as adults were originally allowed.

Other than that the day and evening entertainment, the food and the staff are second to none and we can’t wait for our next trip.

Special mention to Rafael the team leader in the ocean drive restaurant who dealt with my wife and her food allergies every day. He was extremely friendly and helpful.

25,150,87,Bognor,4,"Just for Tots The new Splash pool is so much better than old pool. More for kids to do, very clean and modern but then it's only been open this year! Love the idea of the in pool photographer, cameras were never allowed before (understandable) but this is a lovely touch to capture the little ones in the pool. Unfortunately the photographer had lost our picture!!
Stayed in Silver accommodation, basic but ok for 5 day stay. We didn't reserve ground floor so getting all our stuff up the slippery metal stairs was not fun! Beds were comfy and apartment very clean.
Entertainment - plenty for the toddlers to do, my grandaughter loved the indoor rides and soft play.
We also enjoyed the arts and craft morning and play doh in the afternoons, perfect for wet days!
The sky line gang were brilliant as always.
Slightly disappointed Justin Fletcher didn't appear as Mr Tumble which was how all the little ones recognise him, we did know as it was advertised as Justin and not Mr Tumble. Having said that he was very good and kept the kids focused and entertained.
Paddington Bear - This was the one we were looking forward to, but very disappointed. The story line the show was completely lost with the toddlers and wasn't aimed at their age group. My grandaughter lost interest and we left early, but then missed the crowds to get out.
I know there's other shows to schedule but the 2 main centre stage shows were split into 2 performances, 2pm and 7pm. We were given tickets for the 2pm Justin show and also the Paddington one. 7pm is very late for toddlers to be watching a show and surely it could of been done earlier. We did go to guest services and managed to get tickets for the 2pm Paddington show which suited granddaughter better!
Food - if you want to eat at American Diner, book early! They get full very quickly. Food there is amazing!
Also ate at Beachcomber, traditional pub grub, most ok but the creamy mash was certainly not creamy, very dry!
Enjoyed the 5 days so much have booked again for next year!

29,161,95,Bognor,3,"80s Weekend Break Stayed at the Shoreline for three nights with my wife and some friends as were attending the 80s weekend.

We had a family room which was quite spacious, fairly modern and clean. Toilet required several flushes on every occasion so suggest a plumber takes a look ! (Room 202)

The only other issue was that the windows looked like they hadn’t been cleaned in months, all good aside from that .

We had paid for the premium meal
Package but after a trip to Guest services we had this refunded after the first day as the evening meal choice and food quality was poor . (Over cooked and bland) and meal times 5pm to 7pm!! Who eats at 5pm!!!

This was an adult weekend break so come on Butlins, you need to adjust meal times as we had no 3 year olds with us 😩.

Breakfast was also 9-11 , too late in our opinion so the staff at guest services very kindly arranged to refund the package cost for the remaining days.

The entire weekend appears geared around providing you every opportunity to drink vast quantities of alcohol at any time of day or night so if this is your thing then great. Lots of stag and hen parties so a great environment for groups etc

The music choice was good (evenings) and the comedy club was first rate 👍

Aside from that there wasn’t much else to do which is a shame , so a little boring during the day. And made worse by being out of season as much of the site appeared closed. Perhaps Butlins could have more activities, food , coffee choices available during the day when running these themed weekends?

We stayed Friday to Monday and sadly never had our room cleaned on Sunday despite asking the cleaning lady and leaving the sign on our door handle. We were in the room when she first knocked and she said she would return but sadly she didn’t 😩.

Although the site appears to have lots of designated smoking areas, we saw plenty of examples of people smoking and vaping by walkways , doors etc and none of the staff appeared to bother trying to enforce any no smoking areas. Very disappointing in this day and age.

Men’s toilets near the centre stage area stank of urine the entire weekend, and floors and carpets and bar seating areas all looked stained and dirty. I guess that’s to be expected when promoting all day drinking , but still a little extra effort to keep clean wouldn’t go amiss .

Aside from the hotel reception staff and those at guess services many of the staff we met were quite indifferent . Not rude of course , but zero conversation, no smiles , no good mornings etc. Not what you’d expect in a place like Butlins.

We checked out on Monday morning and there was no where to eat outside the Shoreline , so we left hungry.

Considering how much money our weekend cost I can’t help thinking we’d have experienced better value somewhere nicer. I doubt we’d return !

31,165,96,Bognor,3,"80’s Weekend We visited Butlins in Bognor Regis with two other couples (aged between 45-60) to relive our youth at an 80s weekend.
We were pleasantly surprised at the shoreline hotel. The room (202) was clean and spacious. The bed was comfy (but the pillows weren’t great) The only issue we had was that we were in our room when housekeeping came on Sunday. We asked if they could come back later but they didn’t.
We had paid for a ‘Premium Dining package’ and the staff on the reception explained that we were to eat our evening meals at kaleidoscope between 5pm-7pm and our breakfast in the restaurant at the Shoreline between 9am-11am
We weren’t overly impressed at eating dinner this early but we went along with it. We turned up at the restaurant at 6:45 and were told to help ourselves to the buffet at the end of the restaurant and if we wanted a drink with our meal, we could make our way to the bar at the other end of the restaurant! We found a table and then headed to the buffet.
There was a cabinet labelled ‘starters’, although there was little evidence of the type of food earlier enjoyed by previous guests other than some lettuce, cucumber and tomatoes - I eyed up a piece of lettuce there but decided not to bother!
On the main counter, there was something that obviously used to be fish in batter, a very greasy looking lasagne, some dried up meat of some kind, an unappealing vegetarian lasagne and some vegetarian ravioli. There were also chips, roast potatoes and some soggy dried up broccoli. I opted for the spinach & ricotta ravioli which wasn’t great but was better than the rest of the over cooked dried up offerings. We didn’t bother with a drink as it was too far to go.
When the young waitress came to clear our plates, I found it amusing that I was expected to scrape all the food off and pile up the plates before handing them to her. I then thanked her for allowing me to do this!!
Being old, we tend to get up early so we would have preferred breakfast at 8am but it wasn’t to be so we made sure we were downstairs waiting for breakfast at 9am the following morning - unfortunately they didn’t open until ten past nine!
I have to say, the breakfast was slightly more appealing than dinner although the sausages were cheap and the black pudding was a bit chewy!
I popped into guest services to find out if there were any other dining options and I cannot fault the staff in there. The young girl that helped me was polite & courteous. She refunded the money for the ‘Premium food package’ (apart from the food we had already eaten) and we were then free to eat wherever and whenever we wanted which suited us much better - or would have done if the restaurants had been open! We did find the Pub & Kitchen which was nice food and lovely staff. We walked into and straight out of the Beachcomber (it was a bit too loud and raucous). We went to go to ‘The Diner’ on Sunday but it was closed. On Monday morning we checked out of the hotel and went to find some breakfast but it wasn’t to be as nowhere was open!
The venue itself needed a deep clean. Although there were designated smoking areas, there was nobody policing this and therefore people were smoking anywhere and dropping cigarette butts and rubbish on the ground. All the bars had very sticky floors- I presume this is to enable you to stay upright after a skinful!
On the whole, I don’t think Butlins is for me but if you are on a hen/stag weekend and can enjoy drinking morning, noon & night and eating junk food then go for it.

32,175,103,Bognor,4,"Mixed review We visited during a “just for tots week” and had a good time, my son is 3 and had a great time. There is good and bad to this review however the good outweighed the bad and by no means ruined our visit. We came a few months back on a day visit and my son loved it so decided to come for the 5 day trip (not really 5 days) can’t check in until 3 and need to check out by 10, but you are able to use the park before and after, we also got a great price on the room. Check in was easy with helpful and friendly staff, we had been given a slight upgrade from a 2 bed to 3 bed, while we didn’t need the extra room it was handy for storage. (Trolleys are also provided to get your luggage from car to room as it’s a bit of a trek)
The apartment was a great size and almost everything you could need was provided, (but here comes the bad)
Before I talk about the apartment I just want to say that I know the cleaners are under a lot of pressure but it’s not what I would expect from a place like Butlins.
The kitchen was filthy with crusty food left on the kitchen tops, the oven hob is also in need of some attention (maintenance wise) it smelt greasy and everything from cupboards to handles had old grease on.
Even after giving the kitchen a clean the grease was still present.
Has a working fridge/freezer and tea coffee provided.
The bathroom was also dirty (not as bad) but we had to clean it.
(I’m not a snob and have stayed in some right dives over the years and if I was on my own I wouldn’t be bothered, but this was a family break and feel things should be of better standard)
It had rained quite heavily at times during our stay and the apartment had a constant damp smell to it and in places you could see walls were wet, this probably being condensation rather than leaks. We would also find our clothes felt damp.
We tried to battle this with open windows and heaters on, however the heaters do work but are in serious need of replacement.
With that being said it is just a room and we spent minimal time in it as I said previous by no means ruined our stay.
Other than that everything else is great, plenty of restaurants form pizza, chippy and pub grub all reasonably priced and the food was pretty good. A few outdoor parks for the kids and of course the amusements. Butlins puts plenty on for the kids, play dough, arts and crafts, tiny tikes cars and so on your always find something to do. You can also do a few paid activities such as football, cross bow and bikes but we didn’t do this.
The shows are good with 3 stages showing different things throughout the day but some things are repeated. (Mr Men, Telletubbies, Skyline crew and more. My only gripe with this is that some of the bigger shows clashed but I guess they need to fit it all in.
Almost forgot to mention the whole point in us coming was a show from Justin Fletcher, it was pretty good, would have liked a few more characters rather than all the signing but still decent.
The Paddington Bear show was great and I think I my son enjoyed that even more and would say it’s a must see.
All in all we had a good time, for the price you can’t complain and my son had a great time you will always have plenty to do with your little ones be it the funfair (VERY strict on child’s heights) trampolines, Helter skelter, bumper cars or go carts (cost £6 per car) inside also has some younger kids rides, a huge soft play again very strict on heights but a smaller area for kids who aren’t quite tall enough. (They also stop the older kids, height dependent going on so your little ones don’t get wiped out) also a small new animal room with snakes, spiders etc that has an occasional talk and you get to hold/pet some of the creatures.
Staff are great friendly and helpful the redcoats go out there way to make sure you enjoy the shows.
Will say the character meet and great on last morning is a little rushed.
A few extra things there that I’m not gonna go into detail.
Burger King, gift shop, bars, coffee/snack bar, face painting, temp tattoos, wax hand models, scoops ice cream(a must) toy shop and supermarket (well overpriced)
I’m not sure if we’d stay again but will definitely return for a day visit.
Sorry for long review, hope people find it helpful.

34,179,104,Bognor,5,"Tots week, huge success for 3 year old A quick summary, silver room accommodation, basic. Entertainment and amenities, fabulous. Staff, brilliant.

We surprised our 3year old granddaughter with 4 night stay on tots week. We were very impressed by the young lady that greeted us when we booked in, she took the time to greet our little one first. We found all the staff whether they were restaurant, fairground, security or red coats to be very friendly and helpful during our stay. Special mention though to Paul on the fairground attractions, was fabulous with the children, and really engaged with then.

When we booked we knew we were getting the most basic accommodation on offer, so expectations were not high. It was evident that the room had been painted recently, giving a fresh feel. It was clean and tidy. Our main gripe was the lack of sockets, only 2 in each room and located in a corner. We hired a mini fridge, so ended up having to swap plugs constantly in order to watch TV, boil kettle or charge phones. Also there was nowhere safe to boil the kettle so extra care was needed. It was a lovely surprise to get 2 rooms that joined through a party door, giving us 2 bathrooms. Unfortunately one shower was leaking from base of unit, and the other ones door was faulty. Maintenance did come and fix the shower unit the same day though. Overall the accommodation, did what was required, beds were comfy as well.

As for the entertainment and amenities, there was so much to do. Soft play frame, indoor fairground, plus outdoor one, large swimming venue with tons of slides and rides, shows, puppet theatre and photo opportunities. I can honestly say there was no time during the week that she was bored. We booked her into 2 activities, first balancability, which we found a waste of time. Rode around on balance bikes and walked over some balance beams. That was it really. Secondly the minibows. Now that was brilliant, they got to shoot targets with mini crossbow, our little lady loved it.

We did go to the arts and crafts but since it was the same craft every morning, we only went once. We would have loved to do the play dough kitchen, but everything seemed to shut at 4pm, so it was impossible to fit it all in. Personally I think 5.30/6pm would have been more reasonable to end the swimming, outdoor fairground and activities.

There are plenty of shows to entertain, she loved seeing Justin Fletcher on stage, but queuing is a bit of a grind. A lot of people paid extra to get b line pass and to get in early. Once they were admitted, they took up the best seats at the front section, we were allowed in. Dispute being near the front of the queue, we could only get seats along the back of the lower area. As it turned out they were good enough to see. We queued for over an hour for admittance, those at the back of the queue were unable to get a seat at all. The evening performance saw the queue start to form 3hours before the show!

The skyline gang are great, as were teletubbies and Mr men. We missed the photo call with teletubbies, so it really made her week when they did a walk about on the last morning.

We paid for the premium dinning, which was a great call. We ate in the yacht diner, and the food was delicious. So much choice. Buffet style counter, so you can mix and match your meal. Every evening there was a carvery plus selection of other dishes. Would definitely recommend, as it works out cheaper than eating in the many other outlets around the resort, and healthier too.

We had so much fun we are already booked to go back in June 2020 for Milkshake mix.

There are plenty of shows to entertain, she loved seeing Justin Fletcher on stage, but queuing is a bit of a grind. A lot of people paid extra to get b line pass and to get in early. Once they were admitted, they took up the best seats at the front section, we were allowed in. Dispute being near the front of the queue, we could only get seats along the back of the lower area. As it turned out they were good enough to see. We queued for over an hour for admittance, those at the back of the queue were unable to get a seat at all. The evening performance saw the queue start to form 3hours before the show!

The skyline gang are great, as were teletubbies and Mr men. We missed the photo call with teletubbies, so it really made her week when they did a walk about on the last morning.

We paid for the premium dinning, which was a great call. We ate in the yacht diner, and the food was delicious. So much choice. Buffet style counter, so you can mix and match your meal. Every evening there was a carvery plus selection of other dishes. Would definitely recommend, as it works out cheaper than eating in the many other outlets around the resort, and healthier too.

We had so much fun we are already booked to go back in June 2020 for Milkshake mix.

36,184,104,Bognor,5,"Tots week, huge success for 3 year old A quick summary, silver room accommodation, basic. Entertainment and amenities, fabulous. Staff, brilliant.

We surprised our 3year old granddaughter with 4 night stay on tots week. We were very impressed by the young lady that greeted us when we booked in, she took the time to greet our little one first. We found all the staff whether they were restaurant, fairground, security or red coats to be very friendly and helpful during our stay. Special mention though to Paul on the fairground attractions, was fabulous with the children, and really engaged with then.

When we booked we knew we were getting the most basic accommodation on offer, so expectations were not high. It was evident that the room had been painted recently, giving a fresh feel. It was clean and tidy. Our main gripe was the lack of sockets, only 2 in each room and located in a corner. We hired a mini fridge, so ended up having to swap plugs constantly in order to watch TV, boil kettle or charge phones. Also there was nowhere safe to boil the kettle so extra care was needed. It was a lovely surprise to get 2 rooms that joined through a party door, giving us 2 bathrooms. Unfortunately one shower was leaking from base of unit, and the other ones door was faulty. Maintenance did come and fix the shower unit the same day though. Overall the accommodation, did what was required, beds were comfy as well.

As for the entertainment and amenities, there was so much to do. Soft play frame, indoor fairground, plus outdoor one, large swimming venue with tons of slides and rides, shows, puppet theatre and photo opportunities. I can honestly say there was no time during the week that she was bored. We booked her into 2 activities, first balancability, which we found a waste of time. Rode around on balance bikes and walked over some balance beams. That was it really. Secondly the minibows. Now that was brilliant, they got to shoot targets with mini crossbow, our little lady loved it.

We did go to the arts and crafts but since it was the same craft every morning, we only went once. We would have loved to do the play dough kitchen, but everything seemed to shut at 4pm, so it was impossible to fit it all in. Personally I think 5.30/6pm would have been more reasonable to end the swimming, outdoor fairground and activities.

37,189,107,Bognor,4,"Just for Tots Sept 2019 We booked a break through Sun holidays for the Just for Tots midweek break, choosing a standard apartment as wanted to predominantly self cater to save money. There’s a supermarket onsite which stocks most things (at slightly inflated prices but generally the norm for most things) but we mainly brought stuff for quick meals with us.

We were located in the fourth row in Oyster Bay, Guillemont, pretty close to the Skyline complex which was great. Could pop back easily for lunch etc. The accommodation is very tired however was clean and comfortable enough for 2 adults and toddler. We had ground floor which was great for access with pram and luggage, however, if you’re a light sleeper, would recommend ear plugs as the noise travels, the family above us were stomping around early in morning and late at night, thankfully we were tired enough it didn’t affect us too much. Single glazed windows didn’t help the noise but electric heaters in rooms helped keep us comfortable. The parking is on the far side of the resort so was up to my husband to lug 2 trolley loads of luggage across the resort in the pouring rain on the first day - pretty miserable start!

In apartment, you get an electric hob, oven (no baking trays though so had to put foil on shelf), pans, frying pan, jug etc, kettle, toaster and we had a small fridge and freezer compartment. No bottle opener, blunt knives etc so would recommend bringing these, and a non stick pan! No microwave, and for £15 to hire, we didn’t bother and made do with the hob. You get a pack with tea towel, washing up liquid, sponge and cloth, loo roll and tea, coffee, sugar and uht milk portions. Bath mat but no towels, also sign to say you can request non slip rubber bath mat if needed (we took one anyway)

Problem with electrical sockets though - there’s only one socket in kitchen which we had to swap kettle/toaster/chargers etc so would recommend an extension lead or block. There’s another single socket by dining table too, none in twin bedroom (that we could find, so had to use an extension from hallway socket for baby monitor etc).

Didn’t pay for linen but got this supplied anyway which helped. Got a travel cot in fine in twin room between beds and put our groblind on window too to prevent early starts!

Entertainment was great, enough shows with Teletubbies and puppet shows during day as well as quieter activities (little tikes toys in pavilion studio, play doh in promenade studio or library in skyline tent) too to keep toddler entertained around naps. Under 5s fairground nice and quiet after first day rush too, often only one on the rides in afternoon. Too small for outdoor fairground rides, had fun in play park, and garden near one of the hotels with sand in. Was a bit restless by main evening events at 7pm though which was a bit tedious, especially when queuing for Justin etc (we did pay for B-line passes which saved a lot of queuing in evening however still joined about halfway down Bline queue at 5.25pm for Justin - did get second row though). Justin and Paddington shows great, Dave Benson Phillips (mainly for the adults I think!) was OK, Sids show wasn’t great though in my opinion, toddler was bored. Drinks ok prices, 50p for lime and soda so stuck to that!

Short 10/15min walk into town with pubs, high street shops and Morrison’s too, pebbled/sandy beach too. Had cheap lunch in Wetherspoons one day for change of scenery.

New pool is great for little ones, although a little on the cool side, just watch out for the tiles down into the wave pool (my little one slipped twice and saw other kids slip too) and in the changing room - take care! Need £1 for lockers, would be good if advertised as caught us out first time.

Ended up packing up Thursday day and leaving after Justin - there didn’t look to be much on on Friday and we were ready for our own beds by then. Drop boxes at exit for key cards so checkout nice and easy.

We got a nice cheap holiday though Sun but probably would’ve been a little disappointed if had paid more. Heard some people complaining about rooms and food plans etc, so glad we had mainly self catered.

39,196,110,Bognor,4,"70s Weekender Our second adult break at Bognor this year and we loved staying in a Reef apartment in the Wave Hotel (see separate review). We’ve booked to return on another adult music weekend purely because we enjoyed the apartment so much and found a great deal, but next time we’ll be paying extra for VIP passes. We used to be regular guests at adult weekends up until recent years, and having returned after an absence of several years, noticed that the back row in Centre Stage (where we used to sit) has been turned into a standing area, so there’s now less seating than before. The queue to get into Centre Stage before it opened was very long each evening and we gave up on the first night (after all, we were supposed to be enjoying ourselves), and instead spent a lovely evening on our balcony! The other two nights we did reluctantly queue and managed to get seats once out of two nights. With the queues being so long it’s obvious the majority of guests want to sit else they wouldn’t bother queuing just to stand as there’s now plenty of room to do so. As much as I don’t want to pay the extra for VIP and jump the queue, with less seating than before it has now become a necessity for our next visit as I cannot stand all evening. The bar service is hit and miss (not the fault of the staff) and it can take ages to get served as there’s no queuing system or method of guests getting served in the correct order. I’d go so far as to say that the Chardonnay from Centre Stage was absolutely vile (like vinegar). I hardly touched it, and it looked as if the lady next to us left hers too!

It’s a shame not everything opens for the adult weekends - the pool for just a few hours on one day only, and no funfair, for example. I can even remember in past years when there used to be daytime bingo, but sadly no longer. However, we did have a good weekend, thanks to our careful choice of accommodation and it being in a location where we weren’t troubled by any late night noise or shenanigans! We didn’t get to see all the entertainment that we’d hoped to but it’s still a place for a fun adult weekend if you’re broad minded, plus you cannot help but smile at some of the clever fancy dress costumes. It can be annoying when the odd guest decides to stand up and dance in front of you (blocking your view) instead of going to the dance floor, and as there are 10 pillars in Centre Stage you don’t always get the best view, so it’s good that they have TV screens streaming the acts so you can pick up the bits of the stage that are obscured!

Not being fans of food court dining, we ate out at the resort restaurants during the weekend. However, it was a shame that The Diner was closed on this break (as it had been on a previous adult weekend we attended this year). This limits the choice of restaurants if you’re looking to try something different each night (and not wanting fish & chips).

Overall I give this break a rating of 4 because the apartment was fantastic and we were not disturbed with any noise during the night. It loses a point for lack of seating arrangements (hence queuing) and the bar situation in Centre Stage, plus limited activities to do in the daytime.

40,202,111,Bognor,5,"Great holidays for young families  We chose Butlins for our holiday as we have a 17 month old and another baby on the way so we wanted a place that would be able to cater for very young families and on the internet Butlins appeared to be the answer. We have not been disappointed.

From the moment we drove into the resort we were greeted by the friendliness and enthusiasm of the Red coats that I remember when I holidayed at Butlins as a child. Parking was easy and there was an abundance of luggage carts to make transportation of our bags super simple. Check in was very quick and we were provided with a wallet with all the tickets and details of the resort facilities and activities that we would need for our stay.

The reception staff were consistently lovely and very informative when we asked for recommendations and were very helpful when we had issues with the TV in our room. We couldn’t view the CBeebies channel; an actual disaster for our child who loves Justin Fletcher and Hey Duggee.

The room far exceeded our expectations if I’m honest. A lovely big bed for mum and dad and a great sized bedroom for two children in the form of a bunk bed. If your children are old enough they even have their own small wall mounted tv to enjoy. Our baby was too small for the provided beds but the floor space comfortably accommodated our travel cot. There is a small wardrobe for them with plenty of hangers and a well placed multi coloured sensory light which our baby loved. One of the best features was the replacement of a traditional bedroom door with a child friendly pirate themed curtain with a split up the middle which would mean a child could easily and safely get to their parents in the other room and vice versa.

In the bathroom, the wall designs have again been tailored for children in a fun and friendly way.

In the main room the child friendly features continue with an ocean themed rug and a wonderful large octopus cushion which my child loved throwing themselves on or sitting and reading on. There is also a large board on the wall with a ships wheel, a compass, a radar and an engine gear selector to be played with. This was very well received by my child. The ocean themed colours were continued with the wall paint colours, the curtains and the bed runner.

The cleanliness of the room was also of a fairly high standard. However there was one day where I’m not entirely sure what happened as the room was definitely serviced but we started the day with four towels and ended it with three and sadly the biscuit crumbs my child dropped mere minutes before we were heading out were still apparent on the vinyl floor when we returned. We’d normally have cleaned them up but pressed for time we thought this would be picked up by the cleaner with a sweeping brush but it wasn’t. This was disappointing.

On the resort I can not recommend the Splash centre highly enough. Fabulous, spacious changing facilities, plenty of lockers (take £1 coin or a trolley token) and lots of showers. The only thing I would note is that as shoes are allowed in the changing rooms there is a lot of dirt on the floors in the changing cubicles and despite seeing several cleaners the turnover is so high they couldn’t possibly keep up. Take your flip flops. Also, whilst there is a provision of hair dryers they are not the greatest.... I managed to dry my fringe and had to reluctantly retreat back to the hotel to finish the job.

The pools are lovely; we stuck to the very small pools which were lovely and warm and had an abundance of floats and toys and also several shallow slides for the little ones to enjoy. In another pool are lots of fountains and shooting sprays of water. Then in the centre is a large tiered fountain which my child loved splashing with. Sitting behind this is the wave pool with some small fountains at the foot. We all loved the wave pool. I can’t comment on the bigger slides or outdoor areas as we didn’t personally use them but they looked equally good fun.

The dining on site is fairly varied but not extensive. We sampled The Diner (American), Papa John’s (Pizzeria), Scoop (Ice Cream), The Beachcomber Inn (Pub Grub) and the South Coast Restaurant (Mixed buffet). In my opinion I think they could do with a sandwich and salad offering as we really struggled to find food we would normally have for lunch. Also, if you have not bought the dining package then breakfast can be quite costly to pay as you go (£11.95 an adult) as the only other place that does breakfast (The Beachcomber Inn) doesn’t start serving breakfast until 9am. Anyone with a toddler will know breakfast cannot be delayed for very long once they are awake so we were given little choice. Don’t get me wrong, the buffet option is excellent and very extensive but if you only want tea and toast (like my family) it’s pricey. If you like a lovely big fry up, pastries and a great continental selection then it’s a good deal.

Similarly for dinner, the pay as you go buffet option does add up (£23 an adult) when compared with the offerings of some of the other restaurants where our bill for two adults and one toddler never rose beyond £35 total for mains, desserts and (non alcoholic) drinks. Again, the buffet option is hugely varied but having now experienced the expense of pay as you go dining, I’d definitely consider purchasing a dining package on a future visit.

The entertainment for all ages of children is pretty impressive. Outside there is a large fairground, lots of fairground games stands and plenty of small outdoor play areas scattered across the resort. My child loved the Little Tikes town which was a designated area full of little Tikes houses, slides and every vehicle they’ve offered (small cars, police cars, fire engines, dinosaur cars or Princess carriages mixed with smaller items such as trikes and push along lawnmowers or shopping trolleys). They have made a purpose built road circuit for the wheeled vehicles and I promise you you could spend hours and hours here and your child wouldn’t get bored. Make sure you’ve packed your snacks and water bottles!

A lot of the indoor entertainment is contained within the Skyline Pavillion and we enjoyed the small fairground rides, the toddler soft play, the Little Tikes area for little toddlers, the discover animals exhibition and of course the wonderful live entertainment on the Skyline stage. My only criticism would be of the toilet facilities - my husband informs me that changing a toddler in the male toilets was an acrobatic feat as there were not as many changing tables than I know there to be in the ladies facilities. In my opinion this should be equalised.

On our ‘Just for Tots’ week we have two headline shows in the form of Paddington Bear and Justin Fletcher live. Please do not underestimate the popularity of these shows and if you want a good view or at the very least a table and chairs then you MUST be prepared to queue and to queue early. We were lucky and arrived at Paddington 30 minutes before the show and we got a decent table. For Justin Fletcher we queued 90 minutes early and although we still got a decent table there were not a lot left by the time we got up there. If I find out the headline acts before our next booking I’d consider upgrading to the ‘B-line’ tickets to gain preferred and early entrance just to take off some of the pressure off a little bit of having your child having a decent view.

In all, we’ve had a fantastic holiday and will definitely be returning.

43,213,114,Bognor,5,"Fantastic young family summer holiday - lots to do! As a family of 4 we travelled from Scotland to come here (especially for the weather) On arrival we were greeted by the receptionist in Shoreline Hotel. Heres a few points:
Room - amazing for kids! The decor is a fab sailor theme with lots of storage, kids bunk beds with disco lights, an interactive TV, main bedroom had kettle with teas/coffees/small fridge, large comfy bed, fresh towels, spotlessly clean, seating areas with sofa, table and large windows. Bathroom again large with bath and powerful shower, toiletries provided. Housekeeping regularly and made towels into different characters which kids loved. A plan of the weeks activities was in our room making planning easy. Also a kids play area of a ship wheel and activities on the wall. Safe room with secure doors and glass balcony. Iron and iron board and small safe included.
Hotel restaurant - we had the meal deal of breakfast and dinner and we are glad we did. We didnt expect much from a buffet dinner but the staff were brilliant at keeping it clean and organised. Food always hot, so much to choose from and a cook always came out to see me as i have a gluten free diet and they catered amazing for this, personally showing me around what I could eat each day. Kids corner, fresh hot food and ice cream factory always a hit.
Swimming pool - amazing! Kids had the best time here, plnety of changing rooms all catered for families, the pool area always clean and well staffed with lifeguards. The kids loved the wave machine, outdoor rapids and slides the best. Although the slides are for under 18's only.
Beach - the beach next to the resort you have to walk to the other end of the resort to get through the gate, the beach is stoney but kids enjoyed paddling.
Fairground - on site fair rides all free and unlimited is amazing, kids loved this and the fun mirror room. Staff very friendly and helpful.
Activities - alot of them you have to book on arrival and pay a small fee. My daughter did the adventure ropes for £12 and loved it, she went around about 3 times. My son did the free archery in the morning. Also book the character breakfast which is free for young kids as they had a ball dancing, using instruments and joining the parade.
Indoor - lots to do indoor from hundreds of arcades, more free unlimited rides, free softplay, puppet shows and animal handling. My kids loved seeing the snakes and getting to hold a chameleon.
Shows and meet and greets - we found it hard to do them all so we picked our favs. We watched Diversity, padding bear, Ben Hanlin, teletubbies etc which are all fantastic, you cannot fault these. They are some of the highlights from our holiday and things you wouldnt get anywhere else, especially included in your holiday price. My kids met a few characters and had their photo.
Evening entertainment - Again there is entertainment in many of their stages so plenty to choose from to suit you and your family. Some of our best was the wrestling, talent show, summer festival and the animal man.
Grounds - are kept nice and clean, plenty of restaurants, shops and cafes and really good prices. I thought it would be expensive but we got a sandwich from the shops for £1 at lunch. A few play parks and quiet seating spots. There is always someone about like a moving piano with a man singing, a man with wild falcons for kids to see and much more.

It is impossible to be bored here. We had the best time. The staff are brilliant with kids, food great quality, reasonable prices everywhere and beautiful hotel. Some of the best entertainment. Our kids cannot wait to go back!

46,228,117,Bognor,3,"Day visitor/regular holidays We have been on 3 days visits and one 4 night stay since the new pool opened in April, we came on the day it opened, and it is such a disappointment.

I gave 3 stars for the fact that we love Butlin's Bognor but the pool I give 1 star.

The changing rooms are always filthy,and have already been vandalised and the toilets made me feel sick on out last visit. Used nappies left laying around, public hairs on the sinks for god knows how long, no soap in the soap dispensers, The smell of urine was so strong and the floor was soaked in either wee or water, we couldn't tell.

There are only 4 showers on the way in to the pool, so people are not showering before entering or after using the bathroom. So if there is urine on the toilet floors it is being walked through the changing rooms and in to the pool area.

I read a reply from Butlins to a review about the pool issues and it said ""this is not the norm"" Well I am sorry but since the new pool opened we have visited it several times and it has not improved. The steps to the slides/rapids/family raft are absolutely disgusting. The pool is rarely warm, the general cleanliness is not present. We have been during term time and holiday season. It makes no difference.

We no longer use the rapids because 1, they are about a foot deep, 2, they are not rapid, 3, they only get fast at the end and my son got hurt in the ribs as he got crushed and I heard about somebody else having had his ribs broken in the same bit. I can no longer use the slides with my Son because the ones he rides I am not allowed to (this is new as I have used them before) a sign has recently appeared to say no under 18's.
The splash pool is tiny and even at quieter times the lido pool is too busy to have a good swim.

The 4 jacuzzi areas are rubbish also. Far too cold to sit in and the bubbles are not strong at all. It just doesn't have the relaxing feel that it should.

Also only on entry on the opening day was there underfloor heating, and when we finished swimming that day it was off. Since then we have not felt it.

I have read so many bad reviews on many platforms regarding the new pool, so I know it's not just me being fussy. They are all of a similar complaint. These issues really do need addressing. The old pool may have been a bit aged, but it was certainly cleaner and a much more enjoyable experience than the new £40m pool. Which had so much hype before opening and yet no-one seems bothered by how many people are disgusted by it. If my son didn't love swimming so much we would stay well clear. But we go in hope of improvements, and always leave disappointed. 😔

47,230,118,Bognor,5,"Yet another fantastic holiday I've been going on holiday to Butlin's on and off since 1975. As you can imagine it's changed quite a bit over the years.

This time we had a 4 night stay in the Ocean hotel, top floor with a wonderful sea view. We opted for the hotel dining package. We got a very good price on our holiday.

Once on resort we hardly needed any spending money which was great as we were on a budget. We got a supermarket delivery to the front gate for our essential supplies (ie vodka and cola).

We couldn't fault a thing with our hotel room, although a lock on the bathroom door and room doors would have been nice. The housekeeping team were very thorough, and every day we came back to a towel animal, a lovely unique and fun touch.

We found the hotel restaurant a little too loud and busy for us so we asked to be moved to the Deck restaurant instead. The food was delicious and you can eat as much as you like. I'm sure we came home at least 7lbs heavier... There was a great range and plenty for meat eaters and vegetarians alike.

The evening entertainment was included in the price and very good. We went to the pantomime and that was very funny. We are 3 adults in our late 40s/50s and laughed almost non-stop.

We spent our days on the beach and our evenings on resort, aside from a trip to their new pool purely to check it out. It was lovely except somewhere to swim properly would be nice. It's definitely more for children than us adults.

All the staff were friendly and polite. They even have Butlin's Butlers at the Ocean hotel.

We had a wonderful holiday and have already booked for next year, next time we're going to try their seaside apartments.

If you're looking for a holiday by the sea I can't recommend Butlin's enough.

48,234,120,Bognor,2,"Disappointing I'm writing this review on the day of check out (not that we know where as the reception near us is always closed)
We had a silver room in dolphin boulevard which did not match the pictures. We didn't even get a double bed. Upon our arrival  (after waiting 3 hours for the room to be ""cleaned"") we noticed the beds had been made but that's it. An empty box of alcohol had been left under one of the beds the teaspoon was disgustingly filthy. I had to clean the bedside table and the storage unit for clothes so our stuff wouldn't get dirty and ruined, not what you expect to do on holiday. The bathroom was very small and the toilet seat not stable so we've both fallen off of it. Both of us have bruises from catching ourselves on the sink aswell. TV constantly glitches and loses sound. Walls very thin so could here next door snore. There was a light placed right outside our door so due to glass panels that light lit up the room the whole night... causing a lack of sleep  (again not what you pay to go on holiday for) nobody is policing the smoking rules so our neighbours decided to stand outside our room to smoke. My main complaint with the room is it made us feel ill. If we were in the room we got headaches and felt sick but when we were anywhere else we were fine. Not sure if there's some kind of leak in here. Also the carpet has some kind of bugs in it as I kept being bitten and if you sat on floor I unpack or tie shoes you'd become all itchy instantly. Due to this we had considered leaving early but felt to unwell to do so.

Splash is nice if you've got kids but for two adults it's a bit pointless can't do widths or lengths as always to many people. There's a toddler and parent hour so maybe a adult only hour or a aqua aerobics class would be good. The changing rooms are very slippy and dirty couldn't feel the underfloor heating either.

There was an incident Tuesday night near our apartment. So the next day we all got a knock at the door and handed a letter to explain. Massive waste of paper but nice of them to try make us feel safe.

The rest of the resort was nice lots for kids to do (not for two adults though). Lots of food places but all seem expensive for what you get would be cheaper to eat off resort. Supermarket is handy but again expensive they add money to the essentials. Didn't really interact with too many staff buy those we did seemed friendly.

All said we didn't enjoy it feel we wasted our money and will now have to have doctors checks to try figure out what was wrong with our room.
We wouldn't come again until we have children and would not stay in the silver room again ever.

49,237,122,Bognor,4,"90s weekend I’ve never been to a Butlins (or any kind of holiday camp)before but was pleasantly surprised. It was really good value for money considering that most activities are included. We paid for a spa package which was very relaxing but they could do with more than two showers in the changing rooms as not nearly enough for the number of people using the spa.
We stayed in a gold apartment which not huge but was adequate for a weekend. The plus side was a balcony overlooking the sea which I think we were lucky to have as not all apartments face the sea.
The drinks in the venue were disappointing. No real ale and the gins did not seem like normal strength. I’ve read many reports that drinks are watered down which would surprise me as I wouldn’t have thought such a big company could get away with this but they did taste very weak so my recommendation would be to buy bottled drinks. Also the drinks are expensive.
The musical entertainment was very good and I would certainly have a more opened mind to going to another adult music weekend.

50,240,126,Bognor,2,"Discriminating behaviour towards my little girl by a lady staff member named HAYLEIGH at Butlins Bognor Regis Resort On our 2nd night at the resort, we attended a family event at the Reds venue where we had a very nasty experience with a red coat staff member named HAYLEIGH. She singled out my 5 yr old girl and stopped ONLY her from taking a picture with the Mr. Potato head character.
When I saw my little girl close to tears I approached HAYLEIGH and requested politely to grant her just one picture as she was the last child in line. I would have understand if there were more children behind her and all asked to leave but to ask just the last child out??? I was told rudely by her that they had already done the countdown to end the photo shoot and that ‘ I should have used my ears to listen better’ !!!! She also said that instead of dancing with my little son on the dance floor,I should have ‘paid more attention to the queue’.
I was extremely shocked at her condemning manner and reminded her that after the countdown five other white families had stood in the queue in front of my girl and had been granted a picture and why was she, the only one to be left out? Also, what does me dancing with my son have anything to do with my daughter who was waiting her turn patiently in the queue????
What is worse is that my daughter had only joined the queue (after the countdown) once I checked with the male photographer there. He later denied any responsibility saying that he was just there to take pictures! When I reminded HAYLEIGH that such an attitude towards a guest and a child was not acceptable, she very arrogantly pointed to her name tag and asked me to report to whoever I liked, it made no difference to her! She spent about 2-3 mins arguing with me and the Mr Potato head character remained in the background but she couldn’t use a minute of that time to make a little girl happy????

We have been to many other family resorts and have never experienced anything like this. In fact, most other places go out of their way to make the little ones feel special. We were initially very impressed by the Butlins resort, the ocean hotel room, the pool zone and entertainment shows where we did see friendly and attentive staff like the hotel receptionist Kirstie and most staff at the pavilion arcade. I am surprised that someone like this lady Hayleigh works in a resort of this stature as she definitely has a problem with brown/dark skin and clearly does not know how to communicate with guests.
I strongly condemn such obnoxious and discriminating behaviour in a place that claims to be dedicated to families and fun. As parents we did not spend our hard earned money, for our daughter to feel inadequate and reduced to tears just before her birthday! (she didn’t want to attend most character events at the resort after that). We checked out of the resort a day earlier than needed and must say that we have been extremely disappointed by Butlins on this occasion.

If you haven’t been to Butlins for some time then your in for a surprise , they have modernised massively , yet still retain the unique original character of what Butlins represents that is simply - fun and happiness! Have a laugh! . The majority of people and families certainly show that. The staff also work tirelessly yet all are happy , friendly and helpful this is what makes Butlins , it’s actually surprising to see so hard work and dedication yet retaining a constant happy persona throughout.

We stayed at the Wave hotel its excellent for young families , they have three hotels in total and the original chalets. We’ve stayed at a variety of hotels over time 4/5 star hotels yet our children aged 8 and 10 have never been more impressed by a room as this one , individual TV’s and LED mood lighting the are sold already and very happy. The especially like the games room in the lobby that provides a variety of PS4/Xbox/Ipads available free for kids to play, there's also a nice bar area in the reception that servers drinks plus decent coffee and cakes.

The rooms are very good , comfy and compact at the same time , they have a fridge , tea/coffee making Machine, TV etc.

There’s plenty to do just bear in mind the majority of activities including the fairground open at 11am with the exception of the new Wave pool facility , this opens at 9am and is ideally best visited early after breakfast to avoid queues or later in the afternoon. The Wave pool facility is superb top notch but can get crowded at times, particularly on a Saturday when more day visitors are allowed so it’s best to use another day is possible.

The majority of specialist activities are at additional cost , this includes bungee trampolines , crazy golf, wall climbing, segways , zip wires , mitre football training (£12 PP) , go karts, bowling and American pool. If you have. Premium option you can exchange your £5 vouchers for you own bespoke choice , to offset the cost. The activity vouchers are available from guest services just in front of the Go Karts , this opens at 10am , get in at 10am to avoid queues. They do packages from £12 per person to £20 for up to five activities which isn’t bad , the activities are age and height restricted so bear that in mind.

The fairground , indoor play centre and shows to make a few are included in your stay but vary depending on you booking option.

The buffer restaurant is good for breakfast and dinner , it has all the classic foods and keeps the kids happy. Butlins also have a variety of restaurants on side from traditional pub, fish and chips (traditionally fried and cooked like a normal fish and chip shop !) Pappa Johns pizza, the Beachcomber , Burger King to name a few , these are all good in fact very good as good as most local chain pubs and restaurants.

Pappa Johns Pizza was superb nice fresh decent Pizza's and the Beacoomber Resturant was also excellent (Butlins Steak and Ale pie !)

The entertainment is good and varied , there’s plenty to do throughout the whole site, there is also a pebble beach 5 mins walk through the gated rear entrance.

Overall we had an excellent happy fun time at Butlins, we will be going back again.

Definitely Download the free Butlins app before you go or when you arrive to see what’s on at what time , including maps of the resort, live show times and all the dining menus plus more.

If you have. Premium option you can exchange your £5 vouchers for you own bespoke choice , to offset the cost. The activity vouchers are available from guest services just in front of the Go Karts , this opens at 10am , get in at 10am to avoid queues. They do packages from £12 per person to £20 for up to five activities which isn’t bad , the activities are age and height restricted so bear that in mind.

The fairground , indoor play centre and shows to make a few are included in your stay but vary depending on you booking option.

The buffer restaurant is good for breakfast and dinner , it has all the classic foods and keeps the kids happy. Butlins also have a variety of restaurants on side from traditional pub, fish and chips (traditionally fried and cooked like a normal fish and chip shop !) Pappa Johns pizza, the Beachcomber , Burger King to name a few , these are all good in fact very good as good as most local chain pubs and restaurants.

Pappa Johns Pizza was superb nice fresh decent Pizza's and the Beacoomber Resturant was also excellent (Butlins Steak and Ale pie !)

The entertainment is good and varied , there’s plenty to do throughout the whole site, there is also a pebble beach 5 mins walk through the gated rear entrance.

Overall we had an excellent happy fun time at Butlins, we will be going back again.

Definitely Download the free Butlins app before you go or when you arrive to see what’s on at what time , including maps of the resort, live show times and all the dining menus plus more.

Hotel was lovely and perfectly located for all amenities. We had a partial sea view room on the 2nd floor. Room was clean and great for kids.
Food can be very expensive with no food plan and to be honest the food was just ok.
We seen some shows but by far the best was sleeping beauty. Pool was great and not overly busy.

60,271,139,Bognor,4,"Family Break After fond memories from 20+years ago, this was my first trip back to Butlins with my children.. We stayed in the silver self-catering apartments which was adequate if very tired around edges (huge gap under main door, and door handles which were literally hanging by a thread). However it was OK for little time we spent in room.
The resort has definitely moved on from when I used to go as child with the main entertainment area now covered to protect from elements, funfair still same and could easily still be the same actual rides from 20 years ago?
There is so much to do and notable the number of activities which now require paying for (Zip wire, rock climbing, go-karts), but gone have the kiss-me-quick hats and donkey rides.
The entertainment for both adults and kids was very good, with childrens tv characters wandering around and doing shows ""brilliant"" and for adults there was evening shows and special performances from Stephen Mulhern and Diversity included in package. One addition and was absolutely worth it was the circus hugely entertaining and some amazing circus skills.
New this tear was the new splash pool (Waterpark) which again was excellent, slides for all age groups and in morning pretty much no queuing, its great for all age groups, and thankfully has a huge changing village as there seemed to be no restriction on numbers as by mid-PM it was extremely busy.
Overall... From adult perspective the resort is very good, is tidy, the rooms are bit tired, food is average and if you get a deal (during august it was 40% off) then is a no brainer.
From my kids perspective.... they absolutely ""LOVED IT"" even more so than the 2 weeks we had just sent on Tenerife. for a teenager there is freedom, there is plenty to do and they don't spend all day moaning about being smothered in sun-cream.

61,278,145,Bognor,3,"Family holiday We had 4 nights stay at the wave hotel recently, the hotel was lovely but the smell of the carpet from the hall and even inside the room stinks. The carpet at the Centre Stage stinks as well. It would be pleasant if they would pay more attention into cleaning the carpets.

The new swimming pool was over crowded, and I don’t think it can hold the capacity of the visitors. The water was disgusting by noon, all pools were already murky. The wait in one of the flumes with a raft was a minimum of 45mins which was ridiculous, to be standing there wet and cold. Maybe they should introduce a booking process to control the amount of people inside the pool, and only a certain amount of time for each family/individual to give everyone a chance to enjoy clean waters.

All in all, we loved our stay as it was enjoyable especially when we went to watch Diversity perform and did other activities, but criticism is necessary for better improvement.

All hospitality staff in the Ocean for their hard work, with little time to complete their tasks. The site was clean and well maintained. All entertainment staff, regardless of your role, made our family feel welcome and safe. Impressed with the quick and professional approach when a child lost contact with parent, calm and efficient. All food was delicious and tasty and resented to a high standard. We did not do the dining plan. If I was to make any suggestions for improvement, this would be aimed at the holiday makers. Smokers and Vapors - please follow the rules as I was fed up dodging lit cigarettes from people walking around camp smoking or dodging large plumes of sickly smoke. Also please do not leave you cigarette ends on the floor as this is classed as littering. Papa John staff need to focus on their customer service skills.
My husband needed convincing to come to Butlins in the first place. The purpose of our holiday was making memories of Dad (RIP 2017) as we came to Bultins as children every Spring Bank Holiday week and he would be proud of how Butlins has moved with the times. See you in 2020.

65,291,153,Bognor,3,"Disappointing Shoreline Hotel, Great entertainment for children! We stayed at the Shoreline Hotel in Bognor in August this year. To be honest we come to Butlins every year during the summer holidays and usually recommend it to everyone with young children, however I can’t say that I will be recommending it so strongly after the break we have just come back from.

Firstly. In a hotel the size of the shoreline there are only 2 lifts, this is usually a pain as it is but this year one of those wasn’t even working. We were repeatedly told by the reception staff that engineers were out that day to fix it, only to find out that the lift had been out for 4 weeks!! This is terrible, the shoreline is recommended on the website for people with younger children, the majority of families having pushchairs too, this meant at times we could be waiting 10 mins for the lift to get down from our third-floor room. 10 mins wouldn’t be so bad, but it all ends up every time you need to leave or go back to your room.
We found most of the reception staff of the hotel completely uninterested and miserable, the ‘deputy manager’ especially, we complained about the lift situation but there has been no acknowledgement as yet. On the second night we asked for an extra duvet and some toilet paper as it had not been replenished in our room, the receptionist told us he would not be long but then never came back! When I mentioned this the following morning, I was just told that he must have been called away, no apology.

The hotel supplied 1 tiny bottle of hand wash in each room that is not replenished at all throughout your stay, I personally would expect this to be provided. With Butlins being such a large resort, I would have thought hand cleanliness be one of their priorities to prevent any sickness outbreaks. We ended up purchasing some from the resort shop for twice the price (maybe this is their motive?)

We were really disappointed that in the Bognor skyline they have removed the baby and toddler area, it left our 18 month old with very little to do, he could go on some indoor rides but was too small to play in the bigger soft play area with his brothers and apart from watching him on the dancefloor during the skyline shows he didn’t really have anywhere to release his energy. The discover animals that it has been replaced was worth a walk around once, but the animals are in such small vivarium’s that we didn’t enjoy it. – Please bring back an area to play for babies and toddlers, during tots week there are lots of little tikes toys and things available, a small, indoor, permanent area like this would be ideal!

The entertainment is enjoyable especially for children, the wrestling and Ben Hanlin were very popular with my husband and 9-year-old, while our 3-year-old enjoyed pretty much everything. I have to say in 6 years we have only bothered to queue for diversity once. Without queuing for an hour + (even with b-line passes) beforehand it is impossible to get a seat and centre stage becomes completely over packed.
The splash swimming pool and the fairground were brilliant, we very impressed with the new pool and found there was something for everyone to enjoy there, including our 18 month old.

The dine around package was ok, we discovered Butlins were very sneaky with their wording ‘the first child eats free’ we assumed that would be our first child but it isn’t, it’s the youngest who is also the cheapest … this is what I would have expected had they not worded it differently.
The Diner was lovely and one of the only places we experienced great customer service, Sarah and Blair were fantastic with our children and so friendly and happy! – Thank you both.

We will more than likely come back to Butlins but not until our youngest is a little older due to lack of things to do for babies/toddlers and we would definitely be staying in different accommodation.

There was a soiled nappy trapped between the baby changing unit and the wall in our changing unit - woman at front desk seemed utterly uninterested. I was expecting Splash to be something better than, or at least on a par with Centre Parcs - it is nowhere near that level. Woburn Forest which was opened 5 years before this over-hyped Butlins water park is just head and shoulders above it. Main buildings are very tired and worn looking. We had a photo shoot at Splash and after we had walked around the pool areas taking photos were told to return the next day, I explained the next day we would be about 200 miles away, and asked why I wasn't explained that beforehand, girl shrugged and said contact guest services. Went to guest services, closed. Phoned them the next day, then told to phone photo booth, several calls later was told I couldn't have them due to GDPR. Contacted customer service ... not interested in my issue, nor my time being wasted like this, and when I said that they should tell customers that if their photos were taken after 4pm, that they had to be in the resort in person the next day to collect them (ie not to waste our time as customers in a fruitless excercise), customer service respond, and I quote 'your comments regarding this being communicated to guests will be kept in mind for future discussions'. That they will only 'keep' this 'in mind' for 'future discussions' makes me think someone needs firing in their customer service department, and as for my wasted time just an empty word 'sorry', not even ""oh hey look you wasted part of your day and an hour or so trying to get your photos by contacting guest services, etc, as the girl advised you to do, here's a 5 pence voucher to buy a sweetie"". I got nothing for that, just ""Yeah, sorry about that"". If you think that is customer service, honestly you need to have a massive rethink.

You have to be a minimum of 90cm to go on most of the rides which they do check so bare this in mind if taking younger children!

The new splash area was also fantastic, the kids loved it and we spent a good 2 hours in there, again queuing for no more than 10 minutes for only a few slides. One thing I would say it 2 of the slides were for under 18s only but suitable for children over 90cm ... this meant that I had to leave my 2 year old at the top of the slide whilst I ran down the steps to check he was ok at the bottom ...

71,308,161,Bognor,3,"Ideal for families with younger children. Beware of Gambling they encourage in young children. I was shocked to see how they are encouraging young children to gamble by putting 2p coins in their so called arcade.

The video games were nice, not a whole lot of variety but they had far more for the gambling machines disguised in cartoon characters like looney tunes, Scooby dooby doo, etc.

I stayed in oyster bay chalet which was basic. We had a kettle (which had deposits or powdery substance as apparently it was never wash properly). Gave us enough sugar, coffee, tea sachets and milk.

We had a king size bed in one room and other room had two single beds. The lounge was large enough to accommodate some extra guests we had with us.

We had dinners at The Deck where food was enough fresh food but had limited vegetarian options and even limited halal options. There are several other restaurants which offer breakfast from 8:00 to 10:30 and dinner from 4:30 to 7:00.

There are other restaurants which you can visit if you don't like the standard paid for dining option.

I had to be slightly firm with them to make me serve halal food (which they did for both breakfast and dinner). They just wanted me to use the vegetarian options.

They have a few rides that you can do free of cost but the go karts is not one of them. I paid GBP 6 per ride, which i think should have been included.

It is a great place for those with young children. As an adult I who is not into gambling, I found limited activities to do.

The new pool was their ""Big Thing"" which I found too small and too crowded. I can't blame people for it was hot and people came to enjoy British Summer.

You get two options for check in. Check in Friday for 3 nights or Check in Monday for 4 nights. I said there for 4 nights.

They do have some performances going on in the Skyline Pavilion and at the Center Stage. I saw a performance of Abba songs which was lousy to say the least. On Wednesday I saw live performance of ""Diversity"" winners of British got Talent, but due to crowd I had to sit on extreme right with very poor viewing angle. They did have screens there but they were almost out of life as the colours of the screen was too much faded after prolonged usage.I could notice the difference very clearly.

The best part was a circus I attended on Thursday. Not so big but it was the best thing they had. Circus was by Gandeys which included some Cubans. Some nice and some silly acts made it worthwhile.

I would not recommended it for young adults as it does not have enough entertainment options.

Beware of the gambling machines there disguised as prize machines. You insert coins to get prize (just like in tipping point program) which makes other coins or prizes move down eventually coming in the slot.

72,310,162,Bognor,3,"Needs a good clean! Just spent a long weekend at Butlins Bognor with my two daughters after coming for day trips previously and never having long enough to do everything.

Firstly accommodation. Sufficient for your needs. The extra sleeping area for kids in the Ocean Hotel is good but the place is manky. Our room had remnants of the previous occupants everywhere from food to hair and sticky fingerprints. The beds were the only thing that were clean. The bathroom passed but the toilet leaked. The kettle was full of biscuit!? I also suggest you do pay a little extra for the sea view. If you’re at the back of the hotel like we were you get woken up at 5.30am with deliveries and very loud staff going about their business. In general the hotel has paper thin walls and as there are many families that can’t control their kids in the corridors after a ton of sugar you can hear screaming, shouting and running until 1am.

I chose not to take up a dining plan and personally I’m pleased I didn’t as we could then choose where we dined and then we could stay away from the canteen type all inclusive dining areas where you feel like you’re either at a high school or prison. The food in the Pub and Kitchen was very good and the service good too however when we turned up for Sunday lunch at noon the place had not been cleaned from the night before. The outdoor seating had leftover food on it and empty glasses hanging around. It was a shame as for the majority of the weekend this restaurant was the highlight.

The pool - average. A disappointment really seeing as they’ve spent so much money on it. The kids will love it but the adults not so much. It’s boring for us as we’re not allowed on the slides and the outdoor rapids are bland. I suggest you go early as people were queuing out the door on a one family in one family out basis by noon. My daughter gashed her arm on one of the slides and ended up in first aid. No one seemed bothered to check the cause and this was a slide for under 18’s only. It also wasn’t very clean at all. When it’s as busy as it is you need constant cleaning staff in the changing area keeping it up together but there wasn’t one.

The good bits! Butlins entertainment is second to none for what it is. After spending the past ten years at other well known UK holiday parks, Butlins really do get it right and invest their money well this way. The panto was great so much so we went twice. Steve Mulhern was fabulous and the Circus was too. ABBA tribute was good too. I highly recommend you invest in B Line Fast Passes though. Well worth it unless you don’t mind standing at the back or having out of the way seating.

Butlins Bognor has a lot to do and caters for families with younger kids really really well and they will never ever be bored but make sure you take enough extra cash as it feels like everything is extra and you’re always dipping your hand in your pocket.

It was great for a weekend away. A week would be too much for me as it was just so constant and in your face and exhausting. I can only do a few days of badly behaved chavvy families with kids high on sugar and there are a LOT of those.

If you can take it for what it is you will have a great time but I suggest you take some cleaning wipes and slippers/flip flops so you don’t have to walk bare foot on the manky hotel carpet!

My husband and myself work very hard for very low wages, we only get to holiday every few years so it's important for us as a family to choose the right holiday do that we can make the most of every moment! We arrived on site and had to wait for our silver room to be vacated by a staff member before we could get in, on entering there was good on the carpets in both bedrooms and an overwhelmingly bad smell of deep heat, we didn't want to start being negative and so we opened the windows and set off to explore! On returning the smell was just awful, but by then the oyster bay reception was shut; we phoned the emergency contact number for assistance - nothing was done, we then hunted down a member of staff on foot a few hours later- nothing done, we tried to make the best of it but my husband and myself couldn't sleep, I was physically sick as the smell was so bad and my husband was very angry - on holiday and we couldn't sleep because of the stink of deep heat! We soon realised the smell was coming from the mattress and pillows, they were absolutely covered, we were covered- my husband and myself absolutely stank too! For our third attempt the next day we went to the main reception in Butlins and asked for some help- thank God we were finally listened to and the kind lady contacted some one to change our mattress asap! Our room also had exposed wiring in our uplighters next to our bed, they were very low down - we had to keep warning our daughter to stay away from them as we were worried she would get an electric shock! We had pre-booked action passes - though the website fails to mention you need certain shoes for the go karts- which left me unable to ride, very upsetting! It also fails to mention that the bungee ropes also require you to wear short or trousers no skirts or dresses allowed- my little girl was devastated! Why not mention specifics on website so that you know what is required for specific activities?! Very disappointing and distressing! We loved the fair rides and spent alot of our time there, the arcades were also good. I was disappointed in the night entertainment- 'late night quiz? And disco?' Was this a joke? As a family we were excited to take part- expecting pens, paper and bundles of fun.... A couple of questions flashing up on a tiny t.v. with the answer following shortly is not a quiz nite....it's a let down, an awful excuse for entertainment! And the disco...? A couple or redcoats flailing about, crammed in between the stage and the chairs is not a disco-its depressing! We loved the sleeping beauty pantomime- amazing job, really fabulous and funtastic! And we loved the circus - really brilliant, made the whole experience bearable! We made some friends with some lovely members of centre stage staff Charley, Jaime-Lee and manager Steven- can't sing your praises enough, shining examples of wonderful people doing an amazing job!!! My daughter was refused to be able to join the line to get her magic kit signed by Steven Mulhern as she was a few seconds late - they gave 10 seconds for people to join line- we couldn't make it in time, no matter how many times my husband asked he was not allowed to join line with my daughter, he promised to sign each and every set purchased, my daughter was distraught and beside herself...long after Mulhern had left, way after the disco and quiz had finished along came Charley and her angels; Charley was so concerned about my daughter being upset and let down, she took time with Jaime-Lee to make her feel special- a million thank you's to you lovely lady's, you really bake a difference! Then Charley and Jaime-Lee got together with Manager Steven, who tracked down Mulhern and requested magic set to be signed as promised! My daughter was so happy - thankyou to you wonderful and caring staff- never stop being amazing, you make a difference in the world!!! Overall we were very disappointed with the whole fiasco, we worked hard to afford this holiday, and we couldn't even sleep whilst there! Would we come back? Unlikely!

76,330,172,Bognor,4,"Last Minute Half-Term Break Booked on Monday & left home lunchtime. Self-catering chalet (2 adults, 2 children) - hoped for the best. They look as I remember 30yrs ago! On a budget it would have been cheaper to go to the other resorts but this was nearer. The kids room was fine, the adult bedroom-combined-kitchen would benefit from better blinds & more privacy but was ok. Bathroom was useable (maybe could have been cleaned better). Would struggle to stay for 2 weeks but for 4 nights was ok.
We took our own food so that saved a fortune. It's not cheap to eat at Butlins or to buy from the on-site shop (please pack food/drink, it's an unnecessary rip-off there). Kids had cereal & milk, then sandwiches with crisps for lunch, fruit & biscuits for snacks. In the evenings we did jacket potatoes or sausages in the oven Ate out on the last night (pub on site). Food was simple but tasty; £50 for 2 adult and 2 kids meals plus 1 drink each, not hugely over what we'd pay locally.
Entertainment good, panto was fab, wrestling too. Ninebot paid activity also great but wouldn't rate archery (too many people, not enough help for youngsters struggling with the bow). Pool was fun, went early each day. Fairground biggest disappointment - 3 main rides broken on last day, 2 of which also not working on the Thursday, Wednesday rained all day so we also couldn't go - the fair was fondest memory from 30yrs ago! If was that bit cheaper to stay for wknds/half term we would go to Butlins more often.

77,337,175,Bognor,4,"Excellent in most parts, disappointing in others. Family holiday, 3 generations 3 children under 9. We had 2 new silver appartments next to each other.
Accomodation very clean and well appointed. It's a pain that they have blocked the direct path from the car park with the Big Top, Makes moving in and out more of a challenge.
Food in resturaunts excellent especialy the Diner. Amazing ribs
 Shout out to brilliant waitress Sarah.
The shop is reasonably priced but no fresh fruit beyond the odd banana.

Pool is great for the children. Differing levels and poorly marked edges make it a challenge for supervising grandparents. Good to read that they have raised the age on the rock slide. It was mainly deserted during our visit. This may also relieve the queues for the other rides.
 The changing rooms are well thought out but the trade off of being able to change little feet in the cubicle rather than the usual scrum at the door does mean that the floor looks dirty. They do clean it constantly.
Entertainment was ok.
Fairground was great indoors and out but why close so early??
Football, the robobike things and climbing coaches were superb. I think the nominal charge improved the experience.
Beach was fun at low tide and a short walk along the prom to the right is a great little play area.
My main moan is the arcade. The machines and tickets are a big hit with the children and adults who want a quiet coffee, but come on Butlins! We expect to loose money but I swear from observation that diligence in refilling tickets is poor. In the end they didn't get enough to win more than a lollypop and even at their bedtime the queue to redeem tickets was ridiculous. So they didnt even get that.
It was a good holiday for 5 days but I think 7 would have been pushing it unless you intend to go out and do some sightseeing.

78,338,177,Bognor,3,"Last time at Butlins Bognor So this is our 4th visit to Butlins Bognor, staying once again in the Wave hotel. We have a top floor room, with a partial sea view (pic attached)

We’ve loved coming to Butlins in the past, but this year will be our last. Don’t get me wrong, the hotel is nice, the food at breakfast and dinner is always good quality and filling, it’s just the rest of the experience that’s started to grate me and the family.

Firstly, the entertainment. As others have mentioned, this has declined this year. Apart from the wrestling (always a laugh), and the pantomime, the rest it just plain boring. Once again Diversity are here and Stephen Mulhurn, but I don’t want to spend half of my day waiting in a queue to watch a 45 minute ish show, sorry that’s just my take on it. Even with ticketed shows, the queues were crazy.

Secondly, prize tickets and machines. I know, I’m a mug for these machines, but the prizes on offer for the tickets had really gone down. This is just ripping kids off, something Butlins seems more than happy to do these days, if there is money to be made, they will be doing it. The increase in people staying in the UK to holiday is certainly playing into their hands. I know they are not a charity, and things in life are not free, but they love to fleece you at every moment.

An example, photo attached of a LARGE portion of chips £2.50 and only seemed to be frozen fried chips, not good.

So, we’re not going to come back next year, even the kids are bored of it so that says something, oh well, it’s a shame

79,344,179,Bognor,5,"Such a magical holiday! Didn’t want to go home Such a brilliant place, I haven’t been here since I was a kid 20 years ago but have come back with my kids which are 6 & 2 and they loved it! Stephen mulhern was excellent, diversity was ok but sadly there ‘too big’ to meet their fans for photos you have to pay for their dance academy to get photos with them, sleeping beauty pantomime was top class and there is soo much for the kids to do we just couldn’t fit everything in in a week! We stayed in the wave hotel and that was very clean with daily housekeeping and overall the hotel was kept immaculate! The whole site was very well maintained and clean with cleaners constantly going round with brooms and dustpan and brushes cleaning up the floors and everywhere smelt clean, we paid for half board dining in the deck and that was very top quality with live cooking stations with omelettes, steaks, burgers and pasta all cooked in front of you and also there was a roast every night, curries, kids choices, pizza and about 5 different desert options which was great! Would love to go back here in a few years when my daughter is abit older as she is nearly 2 but doesn’t sit still for long so we didn’t get to see the whole show when we went to watch one as she keeps running off 🤦‍♀️ but in a few years would be perfect to come again 😁 overall this really was a magical experience and after coming to butlins you don’t want to visit any other holiday park!

The queues for the shows need sorting and perhaps have allocated seating as people were just running and pushing to get near the front and takes over a hour in a queue to guarantee a seat.
We stayed in deluxe suite which was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed, only downside was the walls are thin and could hear neighbours conversation.

81,346,184,Bognor,4,"Ocean Hotel & spa fabulous. Splash waterworld disappointing  We stayed Friday 9th August for 3 nights. My birthday weekend and just me and my daughter in the Ocean Hotel twin room.
I’ll list the good points first....
Hotel, restaurant and room were all clean, room had twin beds but these were very small singles and not really suitable for a 6ft tall adult such as myself. Pillows were also uncomfortable so didn’t sleep well at all whilst here. However, generally we were satisfied with every other element of our stay in the hotel. Staff were all friendly, good selection of food in restaurant. Loved the pasta/omelette station for freshly cooked choices.
We had a 2 hour spa session followed by the complete calmness 2 in 1 treatment which was a facial and back massage. We both thoroughly enjoyed this time however the only downside I would say is that the spa session was 1.30-3.30pm with our treatments booked for 3.30pm this meant that we lost about 15 mins of spa time as we were required to shower, dry off and change into underwear for our treatments. Would be better to allow for showering time between spa use and treatment time.
Overall though the spa was lovely and good value.
The evening entertainment provided by the resort was excellent. A good choice of different shows and we sometimes found ourselves venue-hopping between CentreStage and Reds to make the most of the shows. The queue however for the Stephen Mulhern Show was unbelievable! We got there at 6.30pm for doors open 7pm, show start at 8pm and we joined the queue at the point where a Butlins rep was holding a sign saying “seats can not be guaranteed” Clearly a popular show so maybe have 3 shows instead of 2 would be a better way to ensure families can be seated together. I imagine it’s the same for the Diversity shows mid-week.
One other point was the draught coke tasted very watered down like it didn’t have enough syrup in it. I asked for a shot of cherry in it (as there is now an option to customize your drink) - however couldn’t actually taste the cherry at all.

Daytime activities....
We bought the Adventure passes when we booked which worked out good value for what was included. However the bowling lane broke whilst we were using it and had to be moved to another lane. I’m glad we didn’t pre-book the adrenaline passes as bad weather meant that the high ropes, zip wire and climbing wall were closed the majority of the weekend.

Now for the brand new Splash Waterwotld. ...
Disappointed is an understatement. Expected much better for the swimming pool considering it’s brand new. Not enough for teenagers or adults to do. One fast flume and one family raft flume. Some slides are under 18’s only so stood waited whilst my daughter queued for those. Stood queuing to get on the raft flume, stood queuing for the rapids. No decent size swimming space so stood in the wave machine area. Far too many people in there. Rapids were far too shallow (imagine the amount of water in a flume) so didn’t get pushed along by the force of the water at all & had to push myself along which was tiring after a couple of goes. Worst part was one of the slides after the rapid splits - the long way round - the drop was very painful. Felt like the bottom of the slide hadn’t been joined correctly. There was a painful ridge which resulted in nasty friction burns and bruises to my bottom as well as a graze & bruise to my ankle and and it ripped a hole in my brand new swimming costume, meaning I couldn’t continue in the pool. Massively annoying.

Going back to the changing rooms the exits to the changing rooms had filthy floors from too many outside shoes being worn inside. The main shower area was flooding out towards the lockers (blocked drains?) and the floors around the lockers were also filthy. Considering it was only about 11am I dread to think what they’d be like later in the day. Didn’t see anyone cleaning the floors at all.

One good point about the pool area was the variety/size and number of changing rooms. They also have spinners to dry off your costumes and plastic recyclable bags for you to take your wet stuff away in.

Overall the new pool which was the thing we were most looking forward to trying out was the most disappointing. Probably better suited to those families with toddlers as there’s a lot of younger themed areas in there.

We stayed at the Ocean hotel and paid a little extra for sea view on the top floor, this was definitely worth it. We also paid for breakfast which is buffet style which suits us as there is no waiting for orders ect. The restaurant was well run, staff work hard to keep tables clean, food stocked and manage the seating well at busy times. There is a good selection of hot and cold food and drinks.
The site itself is generally clean, a bit smelly in the main white tent area though. Theres lots of eateries but we found a pub a couple of miles away that did a carvery which was better for us.
The entertainment was fantastic, we really enjoyed the live shows and were expecting not to be able to get a seat but this was never the case.
The kids loved the new pool. I'm not certain how safe some of the slides are though or the rapid type ride. My husband and my son ended up with friction burns and one chap was taken to hospital with an injury at the pool whilst we were there so be careful. It's a shame there is no outdoor pool.
We had a fantastic few days and have booked to return next year.

Now I love picking holes in things and I could about this holiday like not enough lifts ermmmmm that’s it.. Well done Butlins well done Butlins staff... Room very nice we had a sea view and it was a real sun trap in the morning, I understand it’s probably not that great on the balcony on colder days.. room was clean plenty of room for a family of 5, bath lovely and big shower very nice I like all the mood lighting..

We payed for hotel dining I can not remember how much this cost us but fantastic variety I can’t complain about the food I had Carvery - Chinese - fajitas - curry and there was way more to choose from. breakfast very good normal full English, cereal and more. Breakfast is 7.30-10.30 evening meal 4.30-7.00 I thought it was strange that there was no lunch, but I completely get it now if you fill your self up at breakfast it will easily last you to dinner not once did we eat anywhere else as this was enough and we are a good eaters..

Pool, very safe plenty of lifeguards and no real deep end me personally would like to swim a little but this is aimed for fun (kids and big kids) my kids loved the pool.. Adults don’t stand on the top of the slides you will slip and bang your head..

Funfair was a hit with my children and it’s all in on the price you pay. go carts are extra as is wall climbing and zip wire which my 2 eldest done and loved... I can’t help but feel the go carts are an accident waiting to happen.. I hope I’m wrong.. we had x2 all action pass not sure it was worth us paying for these my boys only used go carts and bungee trampoline..

Entertainment was very good and my children really enjoyed, the circus was apparently really good ( I can’t stand the circus I sat this one out ) we payed for B-line pass I’m not sure if it’s worth the money to be honest..

We all felt very tired every night which I think is a good sign that everyone had a great time.. the only thing that lets it down are some of the guests not all but some for example, yes you have to join a queue for the eat as much as you like dining it s not a big queue but it gets big when you reach the front and take ages deciding what you want to eat or if you decide to ignore the queue and just step in from the other end.. I was managing to fill my plate in around 30 seconds some people stand there
scratching there heads wondering what to eat for a couple minutes... And Men what is it about going to the toilet and not washing your hands Not all men obviously (I am a man) but this is how people get ill and it’s a shame to see especially seen as there are so many children around..

Now I love picking holes in things and I could about this holiday like not enough lifts ermmmmm that’s it.. Well done Butlins well done Butlins staff... Room very nice we had a sea view and it was a real sun trap in the morning, I understand it’s probably not that great on the balcony on colder days.. room was clean plenty of room for a family of 5, bath lovely and big shower very nice I like all the mood lighting..

We payed for hotel dining I can not remember how much this cost us but fantastic variety I can’t complain about the food I had Carvery - Chinese - fajitas - curry and there was way more to choose from. breakfast very good normal full English, cereal and more. Breakfast is 7.30-10.30 evening meal 4.30-7.00 I thought it was strange that there was no lunch, but I completely get it now if you fill your self up at breakfast it will easily last you to dinner not once did we eat anywhere else as this was enough and we are a good eaters..

Pool, very safe plenty of lifeguards and no real deep end me personally would like to swim a little but this is aimed for fun (kids and big kids) my kids loved the pool.. Adults don’t stand on the top of the slides you will slip and bang your head..

Funfair was a hit with my children and it’s all in on the price you pay. go carts are extra as is wall climbing and zip wire which my 2 eldest done and loved... I can’t help but feel the go carts are an accident waiting to happen.. I hope I’m wrong.. we had x2 all action pass not sure it was worth us paying for these my boys only used go carts and bungee trampoline..

Entertainment was very good and my children really enjoyed, the circus was apparently really good ( I can’t stand the circus I sat this one out ) we payed for B-line pass I’m not sure if it’s worth the money to be honest..

We all felt very tired every night which I think is a good sign that everyone had a great time.. the only thing that lets it down are some of the guests not all but some for example, yes you have to join a queue for the eat as much as you like dining it s not a big queue but it gets big when you reach the front and take ages deciding what you want to eat or if you decide to ignore the queue and just step in from the other end.. I was managing to fill my plate in around 30 seconds some people stand there
scratching there heads wondering what to eat for a couple minutes... And Men what is it about going to the toilet and not washing your hands Not all men obviously (I am a man) but this is how people get ill and it’s a shame to see especially seen as there are so many children around..
It was really lovely to see children of all abilities enjoying them selves

89,373,195,Bognor,3,"This is just a money making machine Weve just returned from a couple of day pass visits with our grandson. We try and do a little trip every week in the school holidays, so a few days here and there works out great. As we had never done a holiday camp I had the ""great idea"" of Butlins. Never again!!!. I should have realised it was too good to be true. The day pass prices were very reasonable, that should have set off alarm bells. As you walk through the big white tent (Skyline pavilion)the first thing you hear is cha ching, that's the sound of the fruit machines and games that only pay out tickets, and 2ps, out of curiosity I checked what the prizes were. A complete rip off, that's what. Those were avoided rather quickly. So you get through the warren of machines, and come to a small stage where they put on a number of small shows throughout the day. A couple of rides for the smaller children, and, I have to say a huge soft play area. This has plenty of seating around it while your child is in there. This, along with the rides was free.
 As you head out through the doors to go outside, this is where the money starts to add up. And of course, who wants to stop their child having fun.And this is just what Butlins figure on.
The first thing we came across was the Bungee trampoline, £5 for 3 minutes!!, this is right next door to the zip wire, Climbing wall and high rope . But fear not, you dont have to pay the full £28, if you book all three, you save £4. Bargain. Then we have the go karts £6. We then saw a group of children having football coaching. Surprise surprise, another £8. If you hadn't spent enough money doing those things there was also a small buggy car ride and mini bot( segway) class.
 Before we headed for the pool, I double checked it was free. It was. I must say the pool itself was great fun. It has something for everyone. The wave machine in the main area was really good, and the flumes and slides are excellent. BUT, the floors in the changing rooms are DISGUSTING. I made sure we all stood on a towel to get changed, then I threw the towel away. I dont think ive ever seen a dirtier, more unhygienic changing room.
 After visiting the pool, we stopped off at the ""free"" fairground. It took us all of 20 minutes( and that's being generous) to do the rides and the hall of mirrors.
 Never ever again. I spoke to a couple of families who were staying, and they were shocked at how expensive it had worked out. But it was their main holiday of the year and they just wanted the children to have fun. But at a price!!!
 We didn't get a chance to see any of the shows, but a couple of good ( not big) names were appearing over the season. But like one if the dads said, once you've seen the show you dont want to see it again.
 I do fully understand why places like these have been going for years, but I have to admit to being shocked by the amount of money the total cost was.
 Overall, I certainly cannot understand what warrants the ridiculously high cost of a few days away.

We made straight for the new water area with plenty of sections for the children and spent a good 90 minutes having plenty of fun. Followed by a good lunch in the fish and chip restaurant. We spent the afternoon at the funfair having a great time. Dividing the cost by 6 people then by the number of hours we were there made us realise just how reasonable it was.
Do we want to go again? Yes please x 6. A really exciting way to spend a day. We were very lucky with the weather too.

91,379,201,Bognor,3,"The new splash world at Butlins in Bognor Regis Visited this late July 2019 primarily to experience the new Splashworld which opened in April. Having been to Butlins in Skegness before, we were expecting the new Bognor Splashworld to be better than the one in Skegness but unfortunately it was not. The area is very condensed and it is primarily geared for younger children. If your child is over 10 there is only a couple of things they can use. It is also not adequate for adults. It can be extremely noisy at busy times with limited places to watch children from. I would say it is 1/3 to 1/2 size of the Skegness Splashworld. There is no lazy river, the rapids are very poor in terms of speed and general experience (not for adults for sure). There are only a couple of flumes! If water is your prime focus, stick to Skegness. My two children aged 10 and 11 actually said they preferred the old Splashworld!! We ate in the Deck, food was good. The Silver Rooms are not just basic but badly in need of refurbishment and was not up to standard in terms of cleanliness so would avoid. I recommend the arcade in the main pavilion for their wide selection of games that my children of 10 and 11 thoroughly enjoyed. Also recommend Archery and outdoor sport activities.

93,384,204,Bognor,4,"Last minute break We have just returned from a last minute break to Butlins Bognor we usually stay at Minehead as Bognor is more expensive but the new pool swung it for us to pay the extra.

Let me start with the negatives. We stayed in Silver room only on oyster Bay, we would never ever stay on Oyster bay again. It is horrendously noisy all day and night, people screaming and shouting all night, 4am & 6am wake up calls are never welcomed when you are on a break, kids running around up and down the walk ways screaming and I’m not talking about babies or toddlers as that you can understand.
The walkways for the upstairs chalets do not feel safe at all. Our room was shaking every time someone ran passed it.

Despite knowing they had noise problems on Friday, we still didn’t see any security walking about on Saturday night, and that was actually an awful evening for noise from 10pm until 4am and then again from 6.30am. We gave up on sleep at this point and considered going home.

My advice if you are booked into Oyster Bay would be to upgrade before you go if you can, and if not take ear plugs, because the noise from the guests along with the seagulls going all day and night as well will drive you mad !!

We paid extra for Premium food court, Coast and The Yacht club is not the same anymore, again kids running around and no one stopping them, the grill stations have gone and it’s basically like food court dining so no point paying the extra in my opinion. However the food was plentiful and we all managed to eat well, it just wasn’t what we had expected or what is advertised.

Now for the positives...
Our silver accommodation was clean and tidy and we had no issues with the accommodation itself, we did hear lots of people complaining about the rooms but honestly we was really impressed compared to Silver at Minehead.

Guest services in Bognor are far better than we have experienced at Minehead, in particular DJ, Adam and Lauren :), they could not do enough to ensure the last night of our stay was comfortable and even managed to get me to rebook for next year, which was something I was not planning on after 2 sleepless nights. Nothing is too much for them and we heard several people saying how good they are, they really do want you to enjoy your stay with them.

We spent our last night in the Wave hotel and it is fab, the kids loved it and that’s where we are booked in for next year, we had a peaceful and comfortable night. Even sat in the bar and played board games that they provide and of course the Games room is a big hit with the teens.

Splash is brilliant the kids spent hours in there, the rapids are great fun and the changing rooms where clean and tidy. Loads of lifeguards around the poolside.

Mareck the lifeguard in Splash deserves a mention, that man has Eyes in the back of his head ! There was an unpleasant situation in the swimming pool on Sunday he spotted it straight away and started to get it dealt with before anyone else had even noticed ! He does not take his eye off the pool. Sadly the pool did get shut down as a result of the situation, but the staff were all brilliant.

Our Kids love Butlins and always have, there is always something to do and I never heard the words ‘I’m bored’ once ! They really enjoyed the Ninebots activity.

Looking forward to our trip next year in the Wave !

94,387,205,Bognor,2,"Mixed Feelings on Butlins We spent a four night break. First the good points, we are exhausted on our return! The days were busy, booked a few activities, splash pool was great, we went everyday. Funfair good, evening shows, circus good. Would recommend going early to the pool as it gets extremely packed and queues for rides can be 50 mins wait. Also the changing room gets very dirty after 11am!

Bad points, cleanliness of apartment awful. Kitchen cupboards dirty, utensils had food on them probably from last guests, kitchen floor sticky, dustpan and broom filthy with dirt and hair. I had to buy my own at local supermarket. Bathroom radiators so dusty, had to wipe down before putting our towels on them. Kids would not sit on the carpet after seeing dirt underneath sofa, no furniture moved for hoovering. It was a new style silver, but though it looked modern, look closer and things have not been maintained or cleaned so have built up dirt. Bring your own pots, pans,
and cutlery ones provided were old and beaten up. Considering we were a family of five, they only gave us cutlery for four.
The entertainment venues also need a good cleaning, floors were sticky and ventilation was awful, no air, horrible stale smell in Centre Stage and Reds venue. They need to clean in between shows, if you go to a later show you have to sit amongst, rubbish, spilt drinks, sticky floors from previous show. The arcades are a waste of money, kids go crazy trying to get as many tickets as possible, you will trade them in for rubbish. Will not be going back to Butlins, definitely not Bognor. Maybe the cleaning in the hotel rooms might be better, but cleaning should be to a certain standard in all accomodation, no matter what level.

96,399,217,Bognor,3,"Bit of a let down in amusements and marauding sea gulls! 14 of us (all adults) visited for a long weekend. The apartments were pretty good. We all had 2 bedrooms of a good size, kitchen, lounge and balcony. The shower cubicle was very small, I’m 6’ and my boyfriend is 6’6”. Height wise was good but door width was a bit of a squeeze and bending for shampoo etc was a task!
The complex was extremely clean and lots of eating/drinking areas. Some of the amusements were only open till 6pm which we found disappointing. Short walk to the pebble beach and a short train (road driven) ride to the town.
On one evening we ate at the Butlins Fish and Chips restaurant. I ordered the regular cod and chips and was served a fish finger size piece of cod. It was not what we expected. One of our friends had crumble and ice cream for dessert. He received half a scoop of ice cream!
A senior member of staff did ask if we enjoyed the meal and we highlighted our concerns, to which he deleted my meal from the bill. Very kind of him. So if you order regular cod - beware!

On another point - watch out for marauding sea gulls. They surround the outside seating areas and will take food off your plate. They have no fear!

We have stayed in a couple of the hotels but more often than not we stay in the Shoreline Hotel with a partial sea view - I would recommend paying the extra few quid for this. General facilities very clean and new baths was spotless. My three year old absolutely loved it and there is always plenty for her to do - she watched about 20 different shows during our week’s stay! The Garden Rapids ride in the new baths is a blast and the family dinghy ride is fun too. Word to the wise though - this swimming baths is aimed very much at children and adults will be disappointed if they are trying to recreate their youth... other than the family raft ride there is only one other flume that adults can go on and after such a huge investment it seems like a bit of a waste. My daughter loved the pool though so that’s the main thing! Will defo be back to Butlin’s and although Bognor is the furthest away it will probably be Bognor again a couple of times next year!

102,429,236,Bognor,1,"Butlins discrimination Butlins discrimination.
Any single people planning to book a break at Butlins, don't bother. Same sex couples need to read the terms & conditions too.
On Wednesday 17th July I booked a 4 night break for Monday 22nd July to Friday 26th July.
I booked a single room for a single person and then an extra payment for breakfast and dinner for 1 person each day. Butlins accepted my booking, took my payment and sent me a confirmation email.
Today, Friday 19th July, I recieved an email saying that my booking had been flagged because I am a single person going on my own. I thought the email might have been a scam so I rang the number on my original confirmation email to be told that, as a single person, I can only go on a live music weekend to a Butlins resort and that it's in their terms & conditions. I was also told that I would have to wait a further 2 or 3 days before I got my money back, so roughly by Sunday 21st July. Seeing as I've planned a break commencing from Monday 22nd July this leaves hardly any time to book another break using my original holiday fund.
During the phone call I asked if it was ok for a married couple with no children to go on a Butlins break and was told that it was ok for married couples of opposite sex but same sex couples would need to prove they are married. On that basis it would be interesting to know if an unmarried, opposite sex couple, would have any booking problems.
The fact that it's in their terms and conditions doesn't change the fact that it's discrimination and, let's face it, how many single people would read the terms & conditions to find out if they had to be accompanied by a child.
Conclusion: If you are single or gay then Butlins don't think you're safe to be around children.

We booked a Nelson stateroom in the Shoreline Hotel, arriving on the hottest weekend this year.
 The air conditioning was broken. It took the team 4 hours after much pestering to inform us it was not repairable(no surprise)
After a visit to assess the heat level they agreed it was not acceptable and we would be relocated.
This was to the Wave hotel, the other side of the complex. It was gone 8pm. We were unable to move the car as the Wave car park was full. We trapsed with kids in pyjamas ladden with bags across the complex,with not one teeny weeny offer of help of anysort.

So just be aware, that is the level of customer service they offer if things go wrong.

You can pay very good money but don't expect the level of courtesy to families that Centerparcs on the other hand offer.

On a positive note the show was great,rides well staffed, pool lovely(though not quite as good as Centerparcs) But be prepared for spending a long time queuing for ...everything!
Hope this may just help if you are considering a first visit with little ones.
We lost a precious day of a very short weekend break with overtired kids, thanks to Butlins.

I upgraded the dining plan and was promised live cooking shows - not once was there any live cooking, only when talking to another guest after we checked out I found out that the live cooking was only offered in 'The Deck'
All the staff and included shows are great, the 'extra' costs is where is hits the bank balance, £10 per photo taken by the resort photographer, £25 for a fairy make over, etc.
The new pool was nice and the toddler mornings were great to enjoy it not as crowded, however the rapids were not open for the whole week we were there and everytime I asked I got told maybe tomorrow.
I'd think hard before returning on the package I paid for as it didn't seem worth it (daily housekeeping were we only received fresh towels on one day as the cleaners turned up while I was preparing lunch on 2 occasions and although I said they were welcome in they just moved on) no live cooking shows, the only thing worthwhile was the parking space outside the room.

105,437,248,Bognor,4,"New pool lovely, rest looking a bit dated  Came for a day visit with a 1y old and a 3y old. First impression are pretty poor, back entrance past some pretty poor looking accommodation and into an area filled with arcade machines, people vaping and drinking pints of beer at 10.30am. But, the new pool complex is great. Changing rooms decent sized and set up fo families with plenty of changing tables and seats to strap toddlers into. Would benefit from someone mopping floors regularly. Pool itself quite busy but no queuing for slides and plenty to keep my two small children entertained. Older children I suspect could get bored quite easily. The Rapids were not working. We did not try the flumes. Lockers take £1 coins. The costume spinner was not working.

The outside fairground was looking more rundown and most of the rides had strict height restrictions - 1.1m for the Dodgems and 1m to go on the helter skelter with an adult. The skyline pavilion was also looking past it's best but my kids enjoyed the toddler rides (there were 4 - aeroplanes, a car ride, teacups and a roundabout that went up and down a bit), and we never had to queue. There was a big soft play, again strictly for 1.0-1.5m, I guess useful to keep the teenagers out. Smaller toddler soft play also. We watched a couple of the kids shows, which kept them entertained for 20 minutes or so.

We ate in the fish and chip place. Food was all edible. £35 for 3 adult meals and 2 soft drinks so not cheap. At the end of the meal they told us their card machine was working and we could only pay cash. We had no cash and all the cash machines on site charge for withdrawal. Manager helpfully agree to refund the cash withdrawal.

We paid £33 for 2 adults and 1 child in term time in July and I thought this was reasonable value. I didnt walk away thinking I'd like to stay for the whole weekend, but would go back for another day trip. My 3y old wants to go back tomorrow so he clearly enjoyed it.

106,439,250,Bognor,5,"Fabulous family holiday Just had our 1st visit to Butlins and already booked to return next year

Absolutely brilliant from the minute we arrived, nice easy check in, our room was ready at 1pm when we arrived which was great
We Had a top floor sea view room in the Oceans hotel with lovely spacious Balcony, room was spotless and cleaned every day, lovely bedroom for the kids with multicoloured spot lights all over.
Room was cleaned every day and our 6 year old daughter squeeled with delight each day at the towel made Animals left by the cleaners using her hair view, hat's and bags as accessories (lovely little touch)

The fair ground was just fantastic we spent 4 days here and the the kids did not tire of it 1 bit and the fact that it's all completely free and unlimited rides is just amazing

The splash park was brilliant, good temperature, lots of slides, lazy river, rapids, wave machine plenty to do for all ages.

The dining....
We Had breakfast included in our price and it was great
Huge selections of fruit, pastries, cereals, and full buffet of fresh cooked full English with freshly made to order omelettes

There's plenty of choice for dining on the resort we ate out each night at a different place our favourite was the American Diner
The portions everywhere were brill and very reasonably priced. As a family of four our average evening dining bill was £45
The Papa John's buffet is excellent value for money.

Centre stage evening entertainment
We paid for the B line fast passes which give 15 mins early priority entrance which if you want good seats for the shows they are worth it
We saw Paddington at the seaside
Matricks illusions and Sleeping Beauty
The sleeping beauty was hands down the best panto we've ever seen hilarious from start to finish

Finally we have to mention the staff
Throughout the whole resort every member of staff we came across was polite, friendly and Always greeted you with a lovely smile

Thanks Butlins we will see you next year

109,453,257,Bognor,2,"Good day but not as described Visited for the day with our little girl (9 months) and although we ended up having a nice day that was more because we made the most of it, rather than because of the site and facilities. Feel like the website is incredibly misleading, and wouldn't recommend it for those with very young children.
Firstly with the mini fairground, swimming and entertainment we felt like we were given an impression that there would be plenty for us to do with our daughter. However everything had height restrictions on and we were not able to accompany her on the rides either. That meant the only thing she could really go on were the paid for rides in the arcade. Not sure what the point is of a mini fairground if those who can't ride the main fairground rides are excluded!
We'd planned on the swimming being a big part of our day, and having read the website we had high expectations. The changing village 'designed with mumsnet' featured several rave reviews so we were looking forward to using them. However to be blunt they are like any other changing rooms I've ever visited, just with a seat belted chair for children in each changing cubicle. The underfloor heating promises 'no more soggy socks' but must have been off on the day we visited as there was a good few centimetres of standing water everywhere - including the toilets! It was a horrible experience really, we wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.
We also had a terrible experience in the pub-style restaurant on site, with slow service, poor prices and terrible value, limited availability from the menu, staff who didn't listen to requests and low quality food.
Both the meals my wife and I wanted were unavailable, and there was no coke zero. We also asked for no ice in the cokes and they were packed full. Our wait for food was long despite the pub being quiet and when it arrived the portion sizes were terrible for £6/7, note the 'side salad', and my chicken & bacon bbq wrap tasted awful.
The bar/bowling area was great and we enjoyed that, although it was bizarre we found the best changing facilities here.
Overall perhaps we were naive to take our little one at such a young age, but we booked based on the info online and feel mislead. Wouldn't recommend for very young families.

110,454,258,Bognor,2,"Don’t waste your money!  Came to Butlin’s as a family of 3 for a weekend trip. We stayed in Oyster Bay. We didn’t have high expectations as we had picked the budget accommodation as we felt the hotels were way over priced for a 3 night non peak break. The rooms are very basic, they do have everything you need but it’s all very old. We were in an end room felt like a fish bowl as all windows are over looked. If your not a fan of natural light and enjoy being watched from all angles this is the place for you. The bed was comfy, on arrival it was broken one side. Staff came around to check on all rooms which was great. Our bed was fixed quickly. The whole apartment was cleanish! The noise levels are a lot though! Walls are cardboard thin so even if neighbours are quiet you can hear it all. Best part was the stairs.... it was incredible made the whole apartment turn into a bouncy castle/trampoline/waterbed experience. Whenever anyone walked up the stairs and hit the landing jumping or not you move with them!
They need to put signs up to remind people that at 11pm some younger children still like to sleep!
The whole park is good but not great. Aimed at younger children around 8. Not much for teenagers. The staff are doing their best but you can see considerable cut backs. The fair ground only has a handful of rides so you can spend more then an hour there. The bigger more exciting drawing you in type rides are charged. And on the expensive side. As is golf, bowling, driving school - all paid for attractions.
Mirroring what other reviews have said nothing is open before 10 attraction wises and lots of the restaurants and ice cream place don’t open til 12.
Scoop the ice cream place is worth a visit. One big bonus of the site.
We booked and visited the diner on Saturday evening. This place is a joke. We waited over an hour for our food. Took 20mins after being seated for our drinks ordered to be taken and then another long wait of 15 mins for our food order to be taken. Then had an hour wait. Which would be expected but there was more empty tables then full ones. Another table walked out as it took so long. We complained and our food order was chased but still didn’t speed up the food process. Staff were apologetic but it took them a long while to come over. Not worth it go to burger kind instead!
The pool is the main attraction, it’s very new and is great. The rapids are fun but only if your children can swim. The changing rooms are disgusting! And very unsanitary. Be prepared to queue for everything.
Staff at evening shows are great though.
Very mixed bag even for a cheap weekend away with the kids, it’s not worth it at all. Another once great historical thing going down the drain! Try haven or dare I say pontins instead!

We’ve been coming to Butlin’s across Skegness and Bognor for a number of years.

Silver apartments. Overall OK apartments but cleaning and organisation wasn’t great to be honest so be prepared for that, we may just have been unlucky this time but it seems to be more common that the cleaners have less time and standards aren’t great.

Food- actually pretty good and enough choice for kids and adults.

Entertainment - butlins have definitely cut back on the cost for external bands outside of seasons or special weeks. Team work hard on stage but ABBA show is poor from a show prospective and I’ve seen loads more invested in previous productions.

Pool- new pool is great, not massive but kid and adults of 20 people enjoyed it. Rapids, slides and flumes are good.

The hotel itself, we can’t fault. The staff were friendly and welcoming especially Amanda who works in the restaurant, she defo made our week more enjoyable! The cleaners were great and added special touches, lined my sons teddy bears up on he’s bed and left a book open in front of them ect.
We were disappointed with the lack of activities on the Monday, there was absolutely nothing on and everything was shut, we understand a lot of people on weekend breaks leave on Monday but for the people that are staying for the week, they aren’t really considered. We ended up leaving site that day. The same goes for the Friday we were leaving, you pay for a day and you don’t get it. Everything except arcades is closed down in an attempt to get people to leave! The rest of the week was enjoyable. Plenty of toddler based activities to keep my son happy. I was disappointed with the lack of characters you see around resort, I think we saw bonnie bear wandering around once, compared to minehead and Skegness this was a bit of a let down.
The pool was great for my 2 year old. He loved the slides and sprinklers, certain parts of the pool were a little cold but this didn’t bother us too much. The changing rooms were ok, a bit grubby but not absolutely disgusting.
Overall, we enjoyed our week but entertainment wise we’d probably go for half term/6 week holidays if we were to go for a summer holiday again, however we have booked Christmas fantasy for December this year

114,479,276,Bognor,3,"Just for tots shoreline, grubby with good staff Second visit for our family. Last year, no complaints. This year upon entering our room in the shoreline it was very disappointing, smelly and filthy. Old toe nails on the floor and chewing gum on the carpet. Was ready to leave there and then, however when I complained the staff to be fair theyresponded very well. No arguements was changed room on the top floor. When we entered that room it was as per last year, smelt of bleach and everything was clean. Good shows, and the pool was good. Two gripes.
1. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out why bugs thrive here. All of the soap dispensers are broken leaving just water. Butlins please change your dispensers to a simple pressing a button to squeeze out soap rather than your battery powered lumps of broken plastic! I brought my own bottle of sanitizer.
2. The dine around package needs a simple tweak. If the parents decide to just have mains and dessert don't bother charging for the toddlers dessert. You've already saved money in not providing a starter and getting a bill of 50p just reeks too much of being tight!

All this said my daughter loved her holiday and will be returning next year. Here's hoping they sort out the soap dispensers and tweak dine around.

New pool would of been good fun if it wasn’t crammed with people, too busy waiting times on most the slides/flumes was between 20-40 waiting time, you couldn’t move without bumping into someone which with baby’s is dangerous. Also only saw one life guard around the hole pool other than the ones on the slides. They should have a max capacity or something as it was just so busy. The floors in the changing room were filthy with mud , clumps of hair and god knows what else. Around the resort wasn’t enough for toddlers. My child was just shy in heigh of almost every ride etc so was really disappointed in that. Only thing my child could to was play in the park or indoor soft play but as I’ve said before it’s just to busy. Not enough for adults to do either. We took ourselves out of the resort 2 out of 4 days as was too busy and not enough to do. Also much better mini golf and ice cream parlour outside the resort! Restaurants are ok but nothing special.

The changing rooms were grim , not clean and pubic hairs all over the floor, it was gross, we overheard a family saying lets get out of here its hell. It was hell, i wish you had kept the old pool open. We wont be coming here for swimming again, the pool is great if you are a toddler or early teens, nothing for adults here, not even a bar or food by the pool, avoid this place if you can. I read other peoples reviews on here before going and thought people were being picky however i agree with them.I also think you should think about doing more entertainment for adults during the day, couples come here not just families and i think it would be nice have a mix of adults and kids stuff. I am also shocked the on site fish and chip shop is closed on a Sunday and Monday yet the takeaway part is open, that should be changed, the whole site should be open not half, you pay enough on a day pass and even to stay there you pay enough I am so shocked at the new pool.

We stayed in the Shoreline Hotel which was lovely and our Grandson was beside himself when he saw his bedroom ( ship bunkbed with a tv). He then got sooo excited at the Octopus Cushion and play board on the wall. We loved the sea view, comfy bed and the mini fridge was invaluable, Also in room was a safe, iron & ironing board, hairdryer, the obligatory TV and lovely mood lighting around the bedhead. The lady who serviced the room was very pleasant and always asked if there was anything else we needed. Just a heads up that if you want to plug a shaver in, you will need to bring a 2 pin adapter plug.... Bathroom was very colourful and we always had hot water, The room was always warm and we could open the sliding door at the windows to get some air if needed ( we were on level 3 - there is a safety panal in front of door).

We had lots of fun on all the rides in the fairground and staff were always very good, We also spent some time each day in the soft play area and indoor rides - again everyone always very nice.

The swimming pool was fabulous and the Grandson loved all the slides - does get a bit cold when standing too near to the Rapids Slide which goes outside. Changing rooms were very clean and attendant was constantly wiping the floors with his rubber broom to stop them from being slippery.

Most of the shows we saw with the wee one were enjoyed by all - sound not always clear but good fun all the same. Red Coats who double up as entertainers lots of the time were very animated and good with all the children. We loved Mr Men, Teletubbies, The Skylark Gang and Billie Bear. Paddington was not such a hit but this may have been due to the darkness in the venue (Grandson not so keen on this environment)
Sound in the puppet shows really not good so we did not see more than one of these.

The Animal Show and Illusionist show were really a little old for our age range and most likely quite a few of the other children on site. This did not bother us too much as the wee one was ready for bed by 7,30pm really.

We loved Little Me (Little Mix) but due to Grandson needing bed, did not get to see the other evening shows which we hear from some other guests were very good.

Food onsite is of mixed quality- we would highly recommend the Beachcomber where we had 2 of our evening meals. Papa Johns was not our most loved experience, the ambience and layout is awful along with not being very clean and and the food was mediocre. The fish and chip restaurant felt nice but the food was not that well presented.

120,507,298,Bognor,5,"The place where Kind people are We have spent a few day’s here this week with our son who has profound and multiple learning disabilities including autism. He also uses a wheel chair.

We stayed in the seaside apartments which was is nice restful and calming colours. When we booked we discussed our needs and booked with the special needs team. Next time we will state we want a ramp to the door as it was quite difficult to get a wheelchair over.

We went for premium dining, the food was delicious and good variety for the main course. We were allocated the deck restaurant and staff were really helpful making sure we had a table that suited our needs. They were really good with our son and spoke to him well. The restaurant was noisy but that suited us fine.

Our cleaning lady was lovely (she cleaned lighthouse 2). She, without asking changed our sons bedding after her had a seizure over night.

We saw 2 shows, the white piano show was brilliant. The tribute to Ed Sheehan was rubbish and boring. A lot of people left when we did.

The day on arrival before we could get into our accommodation we changed our son in the disabled toilet. It’s tiny. These days when accessible toilets are built these they have to be bigger. Butlins you are brilliant with people with additional needs, but please afford them more dignity when using tour public toilets.

121,516,300,Bognor,1,"Awful stay I booked a 4 night break to Butlins in Bognor Regis for my son’s 2nd birthday. We arrived on Monday 10th June to find there was no entrance for those on foot (we travelled by train) we then had to stand in the pouring rain until a staff member found our booking and told us where to check in. You cannot enter your apartment until 4pm so that is a waste of 1 day. We got to our standard apartment in Egret Avenue to discover cigarette ends and broken glass outside the door. Entering the property there was a distinct smell of cannabis. It got worst the more I looked around the apartment. The table was broken, there was thick dust everywhere, the kitchen sides hadn’t been cleaned, there was chunks missing out the floor and table, the bathroom had blood marks on the walls and hair/dust everywhere. The toilet was broken and the whole apartment needed renovating. There was no way I was staying in that apartment regardless of price. I complained to the lady in the Oyster Bay Reception and showed her the pictures of the apartment. She rang someone who said I can be moved to a different apartment. Luckily enough we were moved right next door to my sister and her family. We decided to check out what the resort had on offer... except everything was shut except the arcades and a few restaurants. I assumed it was because it was late in the evening. The next morning my fiancé was making us a cup of tea when the kettle blew up and threw boiling water all over the kitchen narrowly missing my son. This had also tripped the electrics meaning we had no electricity. My partner went to guest services and explained what had happened. He was told it was a priority and would be sorted within 2 hours and someone would come and clean up the water. We stayed in the apartment for 3 hours waiting, but no one turned up. We had to go out as my son was throwing an absolute fit at being stuck indoors. I assumed someone may come and sort it whilst we were out. Unfortunately not. We got home to no electricity and a wet floor still. My fiancé decided to sort the electrics himself and we cleaned up the floor. My fiancé is Type 1 diabetic and needs the fridge to keep his insulin cold. Luckily the fridge remained at a cool level. We never heard anything back from guest services or maintenance during our short stay. We then decided to take advantage of the new swimming pool. Unfortunately the main pool and wave pool was much too cold for my son. He ended up with blue lips so we had to leave there. The children's pools were warm, but much too crowded to actually do anything. We then decided to do some rides, only to find it all shut down. We had no idea that pretty much everything on the resort shuts at 5pm. In summer. Including the pool. This is ridiculous. We decided to go and try The Diner for dinner... which was shut. Then we thought we will try Scoop the ice cream parlour, this was also shut. By this point I had already had enough. What the hell did I pay £400+ for? They charge you for EVERYTHING regardless if you have a pass. Want to ride a go cart? That’s £6 per go! Want to ride a dune buggy? That’s £2 for 1 go. Want to ride the new VR machines? That’s £5 per person. Want to play mini golf? Thats more money. Want to rent a family bike? Thats £9 for 30 minutes. We couldn’t use the outside parks because they were under maintenance. We couldn’t use the soft play throughout our stay as 1 it was just too busy and 2 the toddler section was overrun by bigger kids bullying little ones. So our days consisted of walking around or spending more money on the arcades. I was extremely disappointed. On Wednesday evening after another nightmare of a day (being turned away from the pool because it was for hotel users only in the morning, to finding restaurants shut again and eating the same thing for the third time) we decided enough was enough and we left Thursday a day earlier than planned. There was no one in guest services or reception to check out or to complain to, so we dropped our keys in a box and left. I have never EVER been so appalled by a resort for families in my life. I will never go back. I’ve complained via email and asked for a full refund.

125,529,308,Bognor,3,"Basic, Great Breakfasts, Room Dirty, Helpful staff Our room was very basic, we’d never thought to take a bath/shower mat before. Butlins had helpfully put up a take care floor may be slippy sign near the shower to limit their liability but a shower mat would have been nicer. The side of the toilet seat was smeared in excrement and the toilet was stained too and as a result we didn’t feel very comfortable with the rooms hygiene/cleanliness. Cost was fairly high (£500+ for 2 people in a basic room Friday pm to Monday am for music weekend). The whole site seemed well run and relaxed. Breakfasts were fantastic, well worth the £8.95

126,531,312,Bognor,3,"Safety concerns and cleanliness of bathroom at 90's Reloaded weekend Just arrived home after 90's Reloaded weekend. Great entertainment and value for money.
Do have major safety concerns - On Friday evening when entering the main stage building, we could hear a fire alarm with voice alarm warning but the security staff still continued to process people and enter into the staircase leading up to the main hall.
No security staff were at the top of the stairs and it was people hearing the alarm that told all the rest of the people to turn back. A LOT of confusion and quite frankly drunk people and poor communication/lack of direction could have led to a SERIOUS incident for Butlins if there had actually been a real fire.
With the amount of people in the building, it would be absolute chaos if there was a serious fire or emergency evacuation. We would like the management to read this review and act upon it.... Re-train your staff and security teams before you do have a fire - HSE Exec would not be impressed as well as people trapped or allowed to enter a burning building. Basically the music was not stopped when the alarm was sounding so the staff could not hear the alarm. Not sure why they were not radio contacted by the control room staff who should have been aware of the panel alarm activation and investigating immediately.

Secondly, hotel room in Wave hotel nice but bathroom needs attention and re-training of cleaning person on moving bin and cleaning behind it.

Overall a great weekend!

128,534,313,Bognor,2,"butlins bognor regis 4 nights stay for tots break programme 3rd june -6th june 2019 This my first time coming to a butlins resort, i expected high service and standards , i was checked in a place that was noisy and in the middle of there entertainment area called skyline dome for the children which i never expected, i hardly could hear the representative and felt i had to raise my voice, The room location was good near the main entertainment are skyline dome, however it was inconvenience to get up there with a pram and a toddler and my luggage. the room was up a flight of metal staircase that stated its dangerous as it had slip signs. I was not impressed there was no lifts to reach your room. My luggage had to be left by the stairs and taken up gradually, There no security or safety as anyone can help them selves to luggage especially as we had to take our toddler up the stairs with his pram first and put in the room and have 1 of us to look after toddler, whilst the other loaded the luggage 1 by 1 up the stairs to our room.
As a result my nikon camera and camera bag went missing, it was stolen off our trolley, and we did not get it back, be aware there a lot of thief's ,they can be EITHER \ the guest and staff in the resort. if there was a lift we could park our trolley in front of the room and load instantly without losing our belongings to a thief.

Our dinner plan was ridiculous we could not eat later then 6pm under the basic dinning plan which was not stated at the time of my booking I made online or when I went to the resort, I only found out when i was turned away from the restaurant. They have premium dining but you only get another extra 1. 5 hours.

The toilets in the resort do not flush properly you have hard time getting the tissue down let alone your own number 2's. In Our room I had to call for the plumber 3 times ,twice for toilet and once for the shower as the water wasnt going down in the shower tray.Then the hot water tap all of sudden stopped working and my husband and i needed a shower, they was no one at guest services as they close by 8pm. my husband could not find where to go , he enquired with burger king staff as they open until late, they told him to go to the first aid room for security. The security put an alert out for the plumber to sort our hot water out. this was not done until 11pm. he was quick to come but its not great again we have no phone number to call for assistance.

 the entertainment also has restrictions the rides inside catered for my toddler, however the soft play had 2 areas and he was restricted as he was under the height and they do not allow adults to accompany child in the soft play, bizzare as my son a member at cheeky chimps and he can do all the soft play areas without me being there or if needs assistance ,im not allowed to enter and help. They had a animals area but did not know the times for animal to be let out for child to handle. This was not on there programme itinerary. It was great lots of fun activities for children to do on their itinerary programme from play-dough and art crafts and( pottery painting and go karts and mini golf was all extra charges which i did not think was fair as I paid alot of money for the entertainment passes 90 pound person including this rate for my 2 years old.If your into the teletubbies mr men and milkshake mr potato head and paddington bear you enjoy the shows.

The BRAND NEW splash pool thats there has new water pool and slides area it is fantastic for the adults and kids. however again there was restrictions on 2 of the slides my child too small and they would not allow him in the lazy river or the faster log flume. I agree their health and safety risks however i would not endanger my son safety, i held him at all times when i went on the lazy river and did not let him out of my sight. the fast log flume was not that fast, the racer slide was more faster and that did startle my child. I was refused the lazy river on my last day, other days i went on with my child, their staff neglected there duties here, as they did not check my son height the first 2 days at all and allowed us on the ride together. I been to dubai and turkey and egypt they allow my son on the water slides and rides that had height restrictions as sole person, as long as I accompanied him and for further safety they gave mats and inflatable rings.

I recommend to stay on self catering as you can eat at your own time and pace with out feeling rushed. And have a treat at the restaurants that operate later. the fish and chips and the dinner and pub kitchen i recommend highly. papa johns i did not rate it worsen then pizza hut and i only ever go pizza oven bake places like zizzi or pizza express which better.

You get to have photo shoots with the character that they have for entertainment which is great but they need more time slots. And when i went to collect my photos like everyone else did on the last day we felt rushed. as we needed to eliminate photos so we had the best choose. its expensive it cost 35 quid for 5 photos. even then the assistant cut out the pic incorrectly and was refusing to rectify and kept it professional and said ive paid for a service and it expect it perfect.

My last night at the resort we could not get into our room the door would not open, I had to call emergency phone number that was provided to me after I made a complaint about having to go to the guest services in person as no phone provided in the room to call for assistance on our first night when had to go out to get a plumber service. We had a reception area by our room but it was operational only 3 days out of the 5 days being there and for short period of time only. We was not informed about a 24hr services if they was emergency at all. we just had to wait until the morning to get hold of guest services to complain for services we did not received.
They dont even provide basic to be at hand easily like a plastic rubbish bin lining. We had to pop out to get hold of lining bags.
we waited a bout 15 minutes to get our door reopened so we can enter this disturbed my son sleep as it was 930pm and he needed to go to sleep. in the result he ended up weeing himself as he needed toilet and we could not get inside the room. He also caught a mild cold the next day as it was windy waiting outside. my husband got a cold as well. The door battery was changed by another technician as the first technician just tried using a master key to open the door, so he came ill- prepared. Finally we got in,
The outdoor play areas great you have 3 playgrounds for the kids. then a cars driving school area , archery, football, and mini golf areas. The traditional fairground area looked better in the pictures, when we got there it needs re painting to brigthen up, there restricted times again it opens 10am until 4pm. if only it stayed open until 6pm. Again height restrictions in place for toddler on certain rides, however the most ridiculous was the bumper cars, I went recently to chessington adventure world park, and my son was allowed to go on the bumper cars, I have been to locaL fairgrounds in my area and he been allowed here he was not allowed, even though he be accompanied by an adult who drive the bumper car. As a result not many parents used the bumper cars as they had toddler my son height. I complaint to the guest services and they said the safety regulations are set by the ride company however I been to chessington park which is more of a specialist in rides and they allowed my son? I felt the guest services just made poor excuses and were controlling the situations to there advantage so toddler are kept restricted.

The go karts area allowed children over 97cm on with adult however this was not clear to me I was told as long as my toddler was over 90cm when i waited over 20 mins and it was our turn my son was measured and we told we cant take the go kart course. we went to get refund and told why and it was obvious because of ,my son height. The the helter skleter ride i got to the top and turned away it was a very steep climb and exhausting as i carrying my toddler. refused for not having a long sleeve top on. I wasnt told this before been handed the sacks to sit on by the assistant. I was very annoyed and frustrated. as it was tight squeeze to get pass other parents and children to climb back down the steps.
Yet this was called a tots break events programme.

Overall they good point and bad but the accommodation, checkin area improved alot. and after hours services need to be explained better, the information pack provided did not have any contact number or information to say where to go for after hours emergency. only had an email which isnt gonna be a fast response like a phone call is. Entertainment passes need to be reduced for a toddler rate, Also the fairground rides height restrictions changed on certain rides that are safe for toddler when accompanied by adults. yet this is called a tots friendly break programme

 urgent attention is for wheelchair person could not have the apartments as they do not cater for them and this is the cheaper alternative. there no lifts for them to access either or wide paths to get around and to your apartment room.

The entertainment was great, all the shows we saw were brilliant, especially milkshake live and skyline gang farewell show

There was so much for my little one to do, with an awesome newly built swimming pool/splash park, arcades, soft play, archery, balance bikes, football, fairground rides and much, much more

132,551,317,Bognor,4,"Second visit to Butlins This was our second visit to Butlins for a Just for tots week. We visited last year and gave a 5/5 review.

Swimming Pool 5/5
This was absolutely fantastic. Our toddler loved it and have to say it looks amazing inside. It really is perfect for toddlers.

Butlins Staff 5/5
Every member of staff we met were lovely and couldn't be more helpful. They really are a credit to Butlins. It really helps with the overall experience.

General Entertainment 5/5
There was so much to do here. My son loved all the rides. Also helped that the staff were giving out high fives etc.

Arcades
Have to say the position of the arcade was not helpful in the skyline. It was more of an issue this year as my son is that bit older. I found many of the machines unethical to be honest. They were made appealing to children yet had major similarities to adult gambling machines. I felt it is early conditioning of children by the gambling industry. We shouldn't have to walk past these when having to get anywhere within the skyline. Please re think this Butlins if you read this. Or at the very least remove the machines which are clearly children's versions of adult gambling machines from the main part of the Skyline.

Room Cleanliness: 2/5
On arrival to the room there were skid marks in the toilet bowl and urine on top of the toilet . Also sticky chocolate stuck to back of sofa (at least I hope it was chocolate). However the house keeping staff we bumped in to were all friendly and helpful. Maybe there is too much pressure on them/not enough staff to get the rooms ready on time? Regardless that's not a nice start to the holiday.

Gold appartments 3/5
Feels a bit dated. The shower is absolutely hopeless. No where near enough power. Beds were too high for a toddler. Matress on single beds were too thick for a bed guard to he used safely. Due to this my wife slept in the other single bed for when my son woke up during the night.

The Yacht club premium dining 3/5.
This irritated me. Last year we went premium dining and were allocated the Deck Restaurant which was fantastic. The Deck had live cooking stations and a separate section, with a good selection of children's meals. The Yacht club did not have either. How can both restaurants be charged at the same rate? There is literally no comparison. You are allocated the restaurant on arrival. We assumed it would be comparable with the Deck. We can't help but feel hard done by. This simply isn't fair as we still paid the for the full premium dining package. However it must be noted all staff in the restaurant were friendly and helpful.

Overall the entertainment was fantastic and my son had a great time. Please Butlins review premium dining, room cleanliness and the arcade issues

We had booked a silver apartment but on arrival were offered a free upgrade to gold, so found we were on the third floor which was only a problem on arrival and leaving days as it is a long haul with cases. Our accomodation was missing its grill pan so hard to cook, luckily good food options on site so tried different one each night all good, queue for fish and chips slow though. New Splash pool is excellent, my granddaughter loved the rock slides. We could not be bothered to queue for Centre Stage although wanted to see the entertainment which was disappointing. Also we came home with lots of tickets from the amusements as the shop was far too small to cope with the number wishing to redeem on the last night. The funfair is good, the rides for younger kids in the pavilion are too, and the staff on these were lovely with the children. Special mention to the apartment cleaner who was also friendly and helpful. Well done Butlins, still a great family venue, we will definitely come back.

135,558,324,Bognor,4,"Nice surprise Visited Butlins last week as a family of six of us, sharing a three bedroomed seaside apartment. I was pleasantly surprised as it had been nearly 30 years since I had last visited.
Check in was easy and we only waited for about ten minutes for our holiday pack to be given to us.
The rooms are spacious and adequately appointment with sumptuous grey carpet which assists with noise reduction. Another surprise was the fact that housekeeping makes beds, cleans and tidies on a daily basis and even wipes up kitchen dishes and puts them away.
Shows and entertainment was brilliant and our grandchildren loved everything about it. It was not their first visit but they were engrossed with the Skyline gang shows each time.
Food outlets were plentiful Slightly over priced but that is to be expected as you are a captive audience.
The supermarket is very expensive with cheap biscuits about £1.50 per pack (take your own)
I have to say I would recommend as it is fantastic for the children, we have already booked for next year and got a very good deal from the onsite booking shop.

136,561,326,Bognor,4,"Family Fun We have been to Bultin's many times, we have stayed in the budget rooms which were very basic with limited facilities and we have stayed in the hotels.

Room only - very basic, a bit cold when we stayed in February, no room service and no area to dry clothes from swimming or rain! It is the UK after all!!

Hotel rooms, we have stayed in all three hotels. We prefer the Wave hotel as we pay for higher level rooms with balconies, albeit you have to pay a lot more these rooms they are bigger and you don't have lots of kids running past the doors. This hotel has a games room on the ground floor to keep the older kids a bit more occupied.

Bognor Butlins has changed since we first went, it has been upgraded a lot and the prices have reflected this. The new swimming pool is good fun but gets crowded.

My kids have started to grow out of the fairground and the activities. If you have younger kids 10yrs and under then they will love it. Older kids will get bored.

Be prepared to spend more money on site in the arcades and queue for shows.

137,564,327,Bognor,4,"Long weekend break I brought my 9 year old son to Butlin’s for a Friday to Monday break at the end of half term. He had an amazing time!

Firstly the positives - the food in the Ocean Drive which came with our dining package was fantastic. Buffet style. Loads of options including vegetarian options. Food really fresh and tasty.

Staff- really friendly without being saccharine. Worked their a*ses off all weekend to make sure we enjoyed ourselves.

Splash swimming pool- absolutely loved the pool and we hardly got out of it all weekend! Changing rooms are as clean as the staff can keep them, they’re always going around cleaning up. Take a pound for the lockers! Showers are all brand spanking new. The seaside theme is fab and there’s lots of rides for little kids and big kids! We went on the Garden Rapids which take you outside on a ‘lazy’ river style course which isn’t that lazy! Lee the lifeguard deserves a special mention for making my son feel welcome and being so safety conscious at his job. I always felt safe as the stairs are not rickety ones like you get at some pools, they’re all solid and safe. The wave pool is great but the waves are very strong which my son loved :)

Entertainment- my son loved seeing Titan the Robot and Paddington. Every show was so professionally done.

Arcades, Amazing Animals 3D and crazy golf we enjoyed very much as well

Negatives- only a couple of things were a bit of a disappointment, one was the water in the pool was a bit on the chilly side but not a huge problem. The one thing that was quite uncomfortable was how cold it is when you’re waiting for the Rapids as you’re standing in a queue in front of the exit from the ride and the outdoor air is blowing in. Could do with some kind of plastic strips hanging down for people to come down the last slide but to prevent the cold fresh air blasting in at everyone waiting.

Only other problem which isn’t Butlin’s fault, bring ear plugs! It was 1am every night that I managed to get some sleep due to people coming back from the pubs/shows and screaming/shouting. Luckily my son sleeps like a log but I’m not so lucky sadly.

138,566,329,Bognor,5,"First Visit to New Pool We visited Butlins on Saturday and was so impressed with the new pool and facilities. We had 11 children in our party age ranging from 3 to 11 years. The new Pool is fresh, light and clean! Changing rooms were clean, spacious and lots more family friendly changing rooms too. Hairdryers that worked and a super machine to rinse your wet swimming costumes out.
The pool had fantastic slides and flumes for all ages. The rapids were excellent and took you outside during the ride. Lots of activities and slides for younger children and an actual helter skelter slide inside the pool.
Yes you did have to wait a short time for the flumes and family raft slide but the amount of fun we had going on them we didn't care.
I loved that when the music came on it triggered the wave machine and you could dance and swim at the same time!
Plenty of seating around for those who didn't want to swim or in fact needed a breather! Lots of lifeguards in duty keeping a close eye on everyone.
Lovely cafe just outside if you needed a cuppa or a snack too.
Overall its a big improvement on the old splash pool and I loved that they have kept a real seaside feel in design. We will be returning very soon.

139,569,332,Bognor,3,"The good, the bad and the ugly  We stayed at the Ocean Hotel on a hotel dining plan in May half term week. We have two 9 year old children, also staying were my brother and sister in law with a 22 month old child. Honest review.

The good

The Ocean Hotel : great location, the nearest hotel to the swimming pool by far, right opposite the fairground and easy access to the pavilion.

Rooms : comfortable, enough storage, shower was great. Lighting was a nice touch as it changes colour (which the children loved) although we did have one night at about 3am when my husband must have moved and managed to switch all of the lights on in our bedroom as the switches are below the headboard!

Dining plan : The best bit! We could not fault the food or service in the hotel restaurant. Lots of choice for adults and children. Themed nights. Drinks service to your table. Not too busy even at half term. Really nothing negative to say about the food whatsoever.

Swimming Pool: Brilliant! As it’s brand new it is v v clean. We only queued for 20mins for one slide (family raft). All of the other slides we either walked straight in or were on within 10mins max. Changing rooms and kickers plentiful and thus was at full capacity half term week. Very impressed.

High ropes/climbing wall/zip wire

We paid fir activity passes, all 4 of us did this, instructors were great, highly recommended.

Redcoats/skyline gang etc

All brilliant

The bad :

The Beachcomber inn : we arrived early on our check inn day so couldn’t get into our room so decided to go for lunch here. Nice interior and reasonable outdoor play area for little ones. Service was quick however the food was awful. My jacket potato was basically raw, both children complained the burgers were disgusting. I didn’t complain as it wasn’t how I wanted to start our holiday, however as I’ve said above the bad dining experience here was more than made up for by the Ocean Hotel restaurant.

Shows : On our first night we went to centre stage and it was chaotic. People were standing as not enough seats, massive queue at the bar. We managed to get seats but not a table which was frustrating as we brought a bottle of wine and kids drinks however everyone in front of us who had a table were sitting there with out drinks! Not Butlin’s fault I know but still frustrating. Lots of comments on how sticky the floor was too. We went to Reds 2 nights which was definitely less hectic although still a funny smell around and strange layout to the room. “Bruno Mars” show was v enjoyable though.

The Ugly

Pavilion : dirty, constantly out of hand sanitizer and you really feel like you need it in here! I’m n need of knocking down and starting again.

Bar Rosso : horrible. Service awful, beer awful, interior awful.

All in all we did have a good time but more investment is needed to bring it into the 21st century.

140,576,334,Bognor,3,"Slashed by the garden rapids Currently at the end of our 4 day break away and a little disappointed by lots of little bits.
Firstly I specifically told the woman on the phone when booking that I needed an apartment with a bath as I have an autistic child and my mother has servre lung disease so booked the standard apartment on a ground floor. They ""upgraded"" us to am apartment with just a shower right at the back of the complex.

The restaurants all have the exact same menu just slightly worded differently and the portions are very small for what you pay.

They run shows during the day but despite paying lots of money for stay we were not entitled to see these shows and when booking we were not given the option of being able to see the earlier shows.

There are a handful of rides literally 6 rides for the toddlers to go on and a 5 rides for older children/adults... Not sure what happened to the carousel horses as that ride vanished half way through our stay. Older children are not permitted to go on with their younger siblings and although children aver 90cm can go on some of the faster rides with an adult it's still too scary for 3yr olds.

There a majority of the activities are in ages under 5s, 5-8yrs etc etc... This meant my 3yr old could not do art and crafts with my arts and crafts mad autistic 9yr old, he could not join in with a lot of the activities and the older children couldn't join in with him in the younger activities meaning we would have been separated for most of the days.

There are a lot of activities that are additional cost like go karts £4 a car, zip wire £8 per a session how ever when booking we were told it was a half hour session, I laid for my 2 eldest children to go on and they were extremely upset to find out after running back tobthe start it was in actual fact just 1 go each, now I would have understood if there were many children booked on to this ""session slot"" but there were 5 children in total and with in 13minutes if starting the session all children were done and no other turns were allowed... Why advertise it as a session? Why not per a go? Well because they know that very little people would pay £8 for a 1minutes slide down a zip wire that's why.

Now on to the new pool... Its plesent for the children, lockers are £1 to use (not advertised or any details given so annoying if you leave the money in your room), changing rooms aren't the cleanest, smelt like poop today and there are is lot of hair everywhere, today a lot of day passes people were at the resort so we had to queue for 30 minutes to get in. They have an adrenaline flume that's fun, a family raft flume which small children couldn't go on despite being in a rubber ring, 3 water slides and a garden rapid... Now the garden rapids hmm... Where do I start, not fit for use, they have marked the damaged tiles with black crosses, there tiles are literally separating and there are cracks in the grout, people end up smashing in to each other in what I call the soup bowl and its impossible to get out of and you get told off if you stand up. I reported being left with a nasty gash in my arm from one of the tiles yet the rapids are still open today and I now have a sliced finger too... I didn't notice the damaged tiles at first and put it down to a random accident but after seeing the crosses today, the damage to the tiles and the second cut I am left furious and upset that my injury couldn't have been prevented. I have had to literally tape my cut shut and will no doubt need it gluing when I get home, I can not carry my infant daughter as I am in a lot of pain and the staff to be honest dont really care.

Will I return, right now I am not 100% sure, yes we had a good time but things need to be tweaked a little!

141,582,338,Bognor,3,"The £40m White Elephant - An honest review:  So we love Butlins, we have been here many times as a family before and were looking forward to visiting the new pool once it opened.

We really enjoyed the old Waterworld with its multiple flumes, space bowl, large wave machine pool and especially the raft ride (before it broke a few years ago).

Let’s start with the good stuff first:
- The new changing rooms are absolutely world class and so well thought out in every single way possible.
- The garden rapids are huge fun, queue was no longer than 20 minutes and it is a leisurely slide outside, a brilliant addition.

Now onto the not so good stuff:
- I can honestly say that I have no idea where the £40m has actually been spent. There are hardly any actual rides as such and most of the pool seems to be firmly aimed at pre-schoolers.
- The new wave pool is miniscule compared to the old one in Waterworld and is quite frankly utter rubbish by comparison.
- The family raft ride is good but has queues in excess of an hour as the raft retrieval machine cannot cope and so you have to wait ages for each of the 6 rafts allowed on the machine at a time to be retrieved. Truly ridiculous.
- The only proper flume called the adrenaline slide is ok but it is basically a black hole drop slide that is over in a matter of seconds.
- The heater skelter slide is about 5m high and quite frankly very dull indeed.
- There are 2 other small multi slides namely racers and stick of rock but neither are particularly enjoyable.

I honestly cannot understand how you can spend £40m and somehow end up with something worst than what you had previously built.

Away from the pool, we had an enjoyable stay. The apartments were clean and spacious. The kids enjoyed the funfair and the shows that we saw and the premium dining plan worked well for us.

It is just such a shame that we left feeling so completely underwhelmed by the missed opportunity that the new swimming pool should have given us.

We absolutely loved the new pool. We’d read reviews that it wasn’t clean but we found it to be fine. Obviously a pool with that many people using it is going to get a bit wet at times in the changing rooms but twice we saw staff going around with a drying machine and we didn’t find it a problem at all. My children loved the rapids and we went down them about 20 billion times. I would be careful taking children who can’t swim on them though as you can get stuck and have to battle your way out if you get stuck in the swirling bit before the end.

We did quite a few of the pay-per-session bookable activities. My 9 year old son did the high ropes and found it nerve-wracking but he managed to complete the course. We also paid for the petrol-powered go karts which were loads of fun and also hired a family fun bike and pedal go kart which both my sons really enjoyed.

We found the restaurants on-site to be reasonably-priced - certainly no more expensive than pubs near our house. There’s a Papa Johns on site that will deliver pizza to your room. My boys loved that.

The only thing we weren’t expecting was the relatively short opening hours of some of the activities (e.g. 10am-5pm for the fair and swimming pool). We would have liked to go to the fair in the evening and maybe do a late swim too. The pool was also not open today (Friday) until 4pm (it only opens 4pm-9pm on Fridays) so we weren’t able to swim before we left. Overall though, we would still give our holiday a 10 out of 10! We hope to return again next year.

Little Tikes area, Tellytubbies show, Swimming Pool, fairground, mini archery, indoor fair for toddlers, soft play, evening shows, animal area, little library - all included and all enjoyed by our son. As long as you get a good price I highly recommend it for this age group.

A few niggles below but not enough to stop a great time.

For toddlers the new pool is great, but for older kids it is worse than old one due to slower rapids, lack of good flumes (eg black hole) and worse raft ride. Although good for toddlers new pool is too cold (partly due I think to the cold air coming from outside with the rapids), both water and air seem significantly colder than most indoor swimming pools and our son was shivering and blue lips after 20 mins. Also they dont let you have toddler on your lap on the slides which is a shame. No deep part of pool and no diving area which would have been good to see as most leisure centre pools have such facilities and again adds to boredome for older children and adults.
Changing room in Splash was minging.

Seaside apartment good, although further away from tent than expected. The old metal steps must be 30 plus years old and are dangerous when wet, Hiding behind a 'slippery when wet' sign is just poor.

Centre Stage needs to rip up the carpet and add hard floor as it stinks and is sticky. Going up those stairs feels like you are entering the den of some swamp creature. Reds felt like a better, more relaxed venue although those columns are annoying.

Now there is no clear path at northern end of Skyline Pavilion (due to pub gardens) it can be annoying to get from A to B at that end. Used to be able to walk straight from accommodation to Skyline to fairground, whereas now you have to meander around, which is a bit of a pain with a toddler.

Butlins used to offer snooker, table tennis, outdoor pool, good flumes in Splash, Jaks venue, petanque, bowls, easy to find football and basketball hire all for free which was great for older children and adults. All this has gone so as a young kids venue I like it, but after 8 years I don't think there is much to offer any more which is sad. For toddlers great, but not much to offer older children anymore. Another big problem is Splash and Fairground closing at 4. This is too early in general, but with a toddler who needs lunch and an afternoon nap it is rather stressful to get there in time. In mornings we were told no slides etc open, which our 2 year old enjoy hence having to rush in the afternoon session. One day was open to 6 though which was top banana!

Butlin’s is truly a place perfect for a family holiday. All orientated around the happiness of kids. What more can a parent want?! The ‘just for tots week’ meant there weren’t lots of bigger kids running around, it was, for the most part, a nice calm toddler pace.

The site:
Well kept, clean and tidy. There are lots of antibacterial hand wash stations positioned around the resort so you can keep on top of hygiene. Always great when you have a toddler to run around after. There are lots of nappy changing facilities around which are kept clean as well as the toilets. There are plenty of places to eat and all have an abundance of high chairs. All the main entertainment and facilities are positioned close together so we didn’t actually use our pushchair. We let her mostly run around and carried her here and there.

Entertainment:
They had so much on! We always ended up watching a couple of the shows each day in the pavilion. My little girl was obsessed with bonnie and billy the bears.
They had softplay, indoor toddler fairground (minimum height 90cm) arcades, bowling, animals (mice, snakes, tarantulas, lizards etc), arts and crafts, play dough sessions, pottery painting, outdoor fairground, little tikes equipment in a separate fenced area, parks, splash pads, puppet shows, baby play area inside, and some other bits we didn’t do like toddler football, balance bikes, Paddington bears show and milkshake live.
We had breakfast with billy and bonnie the bear one morning which was lots of fun, we ended up doing a big dance around the restaurant with tambourines! You can put billy the bear to bed too, we did it one night but found it quite late at 8pm. Little lady was so overtired she was a nightmare to get to sleep afterwards. But she really enjoyed going to Billy’s room and getting him tucked up into bed!

The new Splash swimming pool is so much fun! It’s 100% perfect for toddlers. Half of the pool is shallow enough for paddling. You can just let them run and splash without much worry! There are 8 toddler slides and a helter skelter flume (mob height 90cm) waterfalls, squirting water, boat to play in, little tikes water tables, watering cans, toy boats and floats to play with (on the toddler session) there’s also a wave machine area and a slightly deeper pool.
The bigger kids slides are lots of fun although I’d say the rapids are a bit slow.
The pool is heated and a good temperature if you’re doing lots of running around. Although for our toddler we couldn’t stay in longer than an hour as she was going blue and shivering. So not quite warm enough for her.
The changing area is great, lots of room and all the facilities you need. Just don’t forget a quid for the locker!

Staff:
Honestly, the best customer service! Everyone is so happy and smiley which really helps you enjoy your stay! The check in staff were so welcoming and we were greeted by billy the bear. Restaurant staff are spot on. The red coats entertainment guys are amazing! Always know how to put a smile on the kids faces. My little Maisie made an impression on Mikayla and the team. They always remembered ‘Maisie with the shades’ when they saw her. Mikayla was so amazing with our little girl, I cannot thank her enough! She really helped make our holiday memorable. We’ll miss her! Billy and Bonnie were so fab! They really took the time to meet and greet the kids when walking around the resort.

Accommodation:
We stayed in the shoreline hotel, room 136 with a patio.
The room had a big double bed, bathroom, sofa area and a separate room with bunk beds (this had a curtain, not a door) but there was plenty of room for a travel cot on the floor. The room was designed well and lots of fun for our toddler with cool lights and a wall with toys on. The room was clean and made up every day by some lovely maids. They always made a animal from the towels on the bed. The hallways are kept on theme too so walking to and from the room was made easier by catching the fish on the carpet/ looking in the cool mirrors.

Food:
We had hotel dining for breakfast and dinner. The tables were all made up with high chairs at the ready and a disposable bib, wipe and cutlery. The food was buffet style with a good selection and different every night. The staff in the restaurant were superb at keeping on top of clearing the tables. Always taking finished plates away so you had more room to get some more! We definitely got our money’s worth with all the food we consumed!
The staff couldn’t be more helpful too! So happy and welcoming giving all the kids high fives!

I can’t wait to book again for next year. This was our first holiday as a family and it went so much better than I had expected.

The accommodation was clean, modern and everything you needed was there.
The site is clean and tidy and plenty of things to do.
The actual event was a blast, and the bar staff extremely efficient and helpful.
I don't normally mention people in particular in reviews, but have to say Charley in the centre stage, won it for me. Smiling, chatting, and generally making the visit to the bar an all round good experience. Think that girl deserves a medal for the service she gave, and just goes to show Butlins do train their staff well in customer service and satisfaction. Will most definitely visit again.

They let us keep the room on for the afternoon whilst we got sorted and even brought over sandwiches, drink and fruit at no cost as we couldn't make it to any food places....they also organised for my friend's suitcase to get back to him as he couldn't wheel it back for the train.

154,631,378,Bognor,4,"Fantastic Easter Break At Butlin's Bognor Regis We have just returned from a week long Easter break at Butlins Bognor Regis and I feel like I need another holiday!

Myself, wife and three year old had a fantastic time along with my Brother and sister in law and their three children.

We went to the Minehead resort last year and I knew it was going to be full on with the days scheduled perfectly for our three year old son.

Personally, I was looking forward to going to the Bognor Regis site as I went there when I was a child and was looking forward to seeing how much the site has changed since the 90’s.

The site is pretty much unrecognisable from the last time I visited but having the same setup as Minehead it didn’t take long to get our bearings (my wife has been several times on work conferences so she know the place like to back of her hand).

The only thing that hasn’t changed unfortunately since the 90’s is the prisoner of war camp style accommodation… I knew that we were staying in ‘standard’ and was prepared for the worst after staying in Silver at Minehead and getting an upset stomach from some nasty bug in the apartment but it was dire! Butlins really need to invest in this area as although you aren’t paying a lot, in this day and age you expect better standards.

I know that Butlins prefer to renovate rather than build new, but it would make more sense to rip them down and start from scratch.

This was the only issue with the break but as I knew it was only for four nights I could tolerate it but was happy to get out the door on the last day.

As for the rest of the resort itself, it was clean, neat and well maintained.

We did the same activities as Minehead which included

Mini Bow – Fun but not so much that our 3 year old didn’t lose interest by the end.
Toddler Football – Which was the same “drill” (as a coach, I hate that term.. Sounds like a trip to the dentist) when we did it each day. Involved running around chasing each other and then playing catch with your child and eventually throwing the ball for them to header which was a stupid move in my opinion as the ball was far too hard for a toddler to be heading!

Daily shows – Mr Men, Skyline Gang, Puppet Castle, Titan the Robot and Mr Potato Head show. All were fantastic and our boy loved them.

Sleeping Beauty Panto – I wanted to mention this separately as although it was an ok show, I have to say that apart from the Wicked Witch who had a fantastic voice, the rest of the singing cast were bloody awful. The Prince taking the prize for the worst and most annoying of the bunch.

All apart from the football took place in the main pavilion which looks impressive and is really nice inside apart from the issue with all three of them across the Butlins resorts, they are really poorly designed for cleaning the inside which is dusty and grotty.

The new waterpark is fantastic for younger age groups as they have lots of slides suitable for our three year old who even braved the racer and stick of rock slides!

The outdoor rapids, family raft and adrenaline slide are great however, once you have been on these a couple of times you do notice how limited the rides actually are inside the water park compared to others! All the cash seems to have been pumped into style over substance as there is a lot of wasted space and I feel that Butlins will need to add more flumes eventually. I did notice a couple of people complaining about the changing rooms being a mess but we didn’t see any rubbish and thought they were great. There was always a member of staff whizzing round with a floor hoover keeping the place dry. The showers were toasty and they had a free of charge spin drier for your swimwear which was a bonus! All in all, we were really impressed with the waterpark but don’t go expecting adrenaline fuelled rides! Even the wave pool was timid.

In conclusion, we had a really good week and would recommend it to family and friends but would advise them to pay the extra and stay in one of the onsite hotels!

156,641,380,Bognor,5,"Butlins 80 weekend Its been 28 years since i was at butlins bognor as an 8 year old girl. Looking at the southcoast world brochure and wanting to have part of that fun. Fast forward 28 years and to the butlins 80s weekend. The resort is completely different from the shanty town huts that i stayed in as a child. Which is now the area where the fantastic new swimming pool is. Maybe not as big or as thrilling as the old, but needles to say has all the charm of butlins carefully design into the architecture. And such a lovely place for a family of all ages to make memories and have fun. We stayed in the shoreline hotel, which was great. My nephews would have been happy staying in the bunk beds and the colourful rooms. The 80s weekend was a great experience. Really worth every penny, from great line ups, TPua, Chesney, Sonia, Tony Hadley all putting on a wonderful show and all appearing to have a great time too. Friday and Saturday night lots of great costumes. Drinks not overly expensive, but they really need to provide more evening staff as queuing for half an hour for a drink detracts from the event. Staff at funfair so friendly. I could never fault butlins as it is a british institution, i really hope they stand the test of time and give happy family memories for decades to come. Thank you Butlins for making my heart smile again. Xx

157,644,383,Bognor,4,"Good family weekend  We stayed the weekend before Easter which was probably a good idea. There was a Easter egg hunt which was good and the place was busy but not packed . This was first weekend since the new pool opened and we stayed in the wave hotel and had the premium dining plan.

So hotel very good ,having and inner bedroom for children is ideal (and a fridge) room spacious clean and fun animal designs of the towels made daily. The deck restaurant was good with a great choice , though wouldn’t want to eat like this for more than a few days (too easy to back for seconds) nice touch for parents is the table service via a buzzer.

Shows were very good for younger children as little miss and mr men were there - need to get there a bit earlier but sometime hard for children to wait as well

New pool is great for the features but does need some better management as the changing areas were in a real mess and appeared not to be cleaned during the day judging by the things left in the cubicles nappies etc.. lifeguards quite vigilant for a good reason but maybe not as friendly as they could be for a family resort ..

Staff in rest of resort were consistently great and this is a good reason to visit Butlins resort , we had an enjoyable family holiday, which is why we went there!

+ Excellent shows - especially Cirque de Hilarious, Sleeping Beauty and ABBA tribute
+ New swimming pool is fantastic and very relaxing.
- Lifts of Eternal Waiting - there is a 7-10 second wait for doors to close which can multiply per journey due to others waiting for lifts on all floors.
- Very few empty spaces for parking after you've arrived so you are reluctant to head out to the shops or eat off campus sometimes.
- Cashpoint charges £1.25 per withdrawal, so if you do get cash out, try to reduce the number of transactions and get it all out in one time.
- Easy to get lost when you go to Butlins for the first time (at least to Bognor Regis)
- Butlins app is good if you only want information about your current trip, but its useless to look at other Butlins sites / later trips etc.

This was our first trip to Butlins and we chose to go to Bognor Regis. I drove here using Google Maps and it takes you to the Day Trip entrance where the staff then direct you to the main entrance but most people then end up going into the Wave hotel entrance before getting to the main entrance. A lot of cars doing u-turns. So find out where you are and which entrance to go to first.
The next problem we weren't sure about was what time to arrive. It states you can check-in at 1pm and your hotel is ready at 4pm (or 3pm if you've got premium accommodation). We arrived just before 1pm but a lot of people were already here and judging by when we left (around noon on the last day) people start turning up between 12 and 1pm. Whilst I don't recommend getting here too much before 1pm, its definitely good to get here before 4pm especially as there are a lot of activities on in the afternoon, but also a most people start arriving between 3 and 4pm and it can get busy at the hotel.
If there's any activities you want your child to do, its probably best to book them on the first day especially if its a free event.

The Shoreline hotel room is very good as you have a separate area with a bunk bed and TV for your kids. Ours had a nice under water theme in the bathroom and an octopus rug and a ship steering wheel on the wall for the kids to play with. The window wall is complete glass allowing a lot of light to come in and the large glass window can be opened to let in the fresh air and its very enjoyable sitting on the sofa with a nice cold drink watching the people outside below. Some prefer to go for a basic room as you don't spend much time in there, but I personally think that when you do retire to your room, to have such a great view that can be enjoyed and having at least a fridge for cold drinks, a separate play area / bunk bed to keep the kids entertained and housekeeping so your room is kept nice and clean and they provide towels so you don't have to. It all adds to the experience - whether its worth it is up to you.

Overall, we really enjoyed it and there was a lot of entertsinment which suited our daughter. We went now before our daughter needs to go during school holidays, and the price is okay. Hard to say whether paying £1000 in the summer holidays is worth it - for that kind of money we'd probably go Disneyland. But definitely a positive enjoyable experience.

Tips:
- Get as much cash out as you need before you go (e.g. to play in the arcades)
- Pop into a supermarket and get any basics (milk, bread, margarine, canned drinks, bottled drinks, cereals, washing powder if you use laundrette etc) before you come. The supermarket on premise ranges from 33% to 100% more expensive for items. What you get really depends on whether you've got a fridge/mini-fridge and/or whether you've bought a dining plan.
- Go swimming (as one of your activities).
- The Centre Stage and REDS shows included in your stay require you to show your wristband as they are not included for day trippers - make sure you go and see them as this is a lot of what you're paying for.
- Consider getting B-Line passes if you don't like queuing / likely to run short of time or have very young kids and find it stressful to queue etc - if you don't then because people queue up to 45 mins before the doors open, then you won't get a good seat.
- When getting stuff from your car to the hotel, the hotel has trolleys so that you don't have to take so many trips (however, its odd that they don't allow you to take those trolleys into the lift to your room).

Improvements Butlins could do:
- Change the wait time for the doors closing in the Shoreline building (and any other building with the same problem). On the floors in between there is only one button regardless of whether you want to go up or down. All guests, unless you pay to leave at noon, have to leave by 10am. So imagine every floor having people pressing the buttons on the 2 lifts all the time. The lift goes up and is filled by people getting on even if they want to go down knowing that if they wait for it to come back down, it will be full. Each floor the lift opens at, there is that 7 second wait for the doors to close. Even if the lifts are empty and you are calling them, whatever floor they are on, they wait 7 seconds to close on that floor if the doors are open before coming to you. It's extremely frustrating. They should look at how hotels like Premier Inn does it.
- The photo booth and the arcade ticket prize counter gets very busy on the last day with people queuing as they have accumulated all their photos with characters and their ticket winnings. However, Butlins does not noticeably increase the staff proportinately to alleviate this problem. In fact it goes out of its way to put on bundle promotions (e.g. 5 photos for a special price) so that people buy them towards the end of the trip. This needs work.

Whilst I don't recommend getting here too much before 1pm, its definitely good to get here before 4pm especially as there are a lot of activities on in the afternoon, but also a most people start arriving between 3 and 4pm and it can get busy at the hotel.
If there's any activities you want your child to do, its probably best to book them on the first day especially if its a free event.

The Shoreline hotel room is very good as you have a separate area with a bunk bed and TV for your kids. Ours had a nice under water theme in the bathroom and an octopus rug and a ship steering wheel on the wall for the kids to play with. The window wall is complete glass allowing a lot of light to come in and the large glass window can be opened to let in the fresh air and its very enjoyable sitting on the sofa with a nice cold drink watching the people outside below. Some prefer to go for a basic room as you don't spend much time in there, but I personally think that when you do retire to your room, to have such a great view that can be enjoyed and having at least a fridge for cold drinks, a separate play area / bunk bed to keep the kids entertained and housekeeping so your room is kept nice and clean and they provide towels so you don't have to. It all adds to the experience - whether its worth it is up to you.

Overall, we really enjoyed it and there was a lot of entertsinment which suited our daughter. We went now before our daughter needs to go during school holidays, and the price is okay. Hard to say whether paying £1000 in the summer holidays is worth it - for that kind of money we'd probably go Disneyland. But definitely a positive enjoyable experience.

Tips:
- Get as much cash out as you need before you go (e.g. to play in the arcades)
- Pop into a supermarket and get any basics (milk, bread, margarine, canned drinks, bottled drinks, cereals, washing powder if you use laundrette etc) before you come. The supermarket on premise ranges from 33% to 100% more expensive for items. What you get really depends on whether you've got a fridge/mini-fridge and/or whether you've bought a dining plan.
- Go swimming (as one of your activities).
- The Centre Stage and REDS shows included in your stay require you to show your wristband as they are not included for day trippers - make sure you go and see them as this is a lot of what you're paying for.
- Consider getting B-Line passes if you don't like queuing / likely to run short of time or have very young kids and find it stressful to queue etc - if you don't then because people queue up to 45 mins before the doors open, then you won't get a good seat.
- When getting stuff from your car to the hotel, the hotel has trolleys so that you don't have to take so many trips (however, its odd that they don't allow you to take those trolleys into the lift to your room).

Improvements Butlins could do:
- Change the wait time for the doors closing in the Shoreline building (and any other building with the same problem). On the floors in between there is only one button regardless of whether you want to go up or down. All guests, unless you pay to leave at noon, have to leave by 10am. So imagine every floor having people pressing the buttons on the 2 lifts all the time. The lift goes up and is filled by people getting on even if they want to go down knowing that if they wait for it to come back down, it will be full. Each floor the lift opens at, there is that 7 second wait for the doors to close. Even if the lifts are empty and you are calling them, whatever floor they are on, they wait 7 seconds to close on that floor if the doors are open before coming to you. It's extremely frustrating. They should look at how hotels like Premier Inn does it.
- The photo booth and the arcade ticket prize counter gets very busy on the last day with people queuing as they have accumulated all their photos with characters and their ticket winnings. However, Butlins does not noticeably increase the staff proportinately to alleviate this problem. In fact it goes out of its way to put on bundle promotions (e.g. 5 photos for a special price) so that people buy them towards the end of the trip. This needs work.

Check in service was straightforward and easy. They have us our access key cards and few tickets for the show. The room was facing sea shore, not very close but had a view from balcony.

We booked only the breakfast in The Deck restaurant which was all you can eat buffet breakfast with good variety of cereals and cooked breakfast as well. Along with it you could even ask them to make an omelette for you or grill sandwich or bacon sandwich. Good variety of fruits, yoghurt, teas,coffee, juices, and squash.

You get porridge with honey and pancakes as well with chocolate sauce or any other one. Didn't look at the other one as we wanted chocolate one.

There are options for food here onsite of Butlins. Fish and Chips, Papa John's and Burger king are there with few Pubs kind of places like Diner, the beachcomber Inn and Hatch club. Fish and Chips is good and they give a good portion of chips too. Where as in Diner the portions quantity is not that good but could be better with better service. Staff are ok but service bit slow. Papa John's have a restaurant but we had a take away instead. Beachcomber Inn is good and the staff are friendly. Their food is really good and filling.

The red coat people in Butlins find them bit patronising and don't interact with people all the time and find them little bit fake at times. Butlins needs to create a little bit diversity within the Red Coat people. I found the red coats a little bit too young and immature at times I think Butlins needs to invest more in their training.

We wanted to queue up for photoshoot with Skyline gang, so we went to the end of the queue to be told that they aren't taking anymore people for the photo shoot. I thought Butlins saying is "" Our true intent is for your delight"" I think their delight was rejecting my 6 year old daughters request to take a photo with skyline gang is. I was totally put off. I remember 6 years back when I went to Minehead Butlins they allowed kids to talk to any of the skyline gang member after the show. I still have my eldest child's pictures taken with all them. Anyway I hope there weren't too many heartbroken parents there.

The swimming Pool is fun and new. There are so many rides where you can go as family height restrictions do apply. But over all the Splash experience was too good. Kids enjoyed it a lot. The changing rooms are very spacious and clean. The water temperature is correct and I could see people enjoying. The best experience in Splash is the rapids and the slides.

The place itself is clean and tidy. They have designated smoking areas but there isn't anyone watching who is smoking in a non smoking area.

The rides are good and they don't charge in the rides. Although they charge for adventure golf and go karts. Not a lot of money but be ready to spend some money.

Overall experience has been good and could have been better. But it's good value for money.

166,677,394,Bognor,4,"Hello campers My first experience of Butlins, although I have been to Warners, Haven, Park resorts amongst others before.

On arrival at the Ocean hotel we were faced with a queue to collect our keys & it seemed to take a little while for them to open all three available counters but that aside we didn't have to wait too long, having said that people were queuing down the stairs as we made our way to our room, I think this could have been better organised.

The two lifts (sometimes three if the service lift was available) just weren't adequate for the volume of people wanting to use them. Luckily we were only on the first floor so could use the stairs. They just needed to be twice the size, once you got a push chair or wheel chair in one there was very little room left for anything else &, although the sign said they'd take twelve people the warning buzzer would go off with just half a dozen people in & then the lift would refuse to move.

The room was nicely appointed, the bed comfortable & the bathroom was nice & clean although the air con seemed a bit hit & miss. There was a control panel in the room but it seemed like the hotel actually had overall control. We felt the bathroom would have benefited from a few more shelves.

Our first meal was in the on site fish & chip restaurant, not very good, the service was painfully slow & the food was poor, after complaining we got our drinks free. The manager was overly familiar & his false bonhomie was cringeworthy in the extreme.

The dining experience in the hotel was sometimes a little fraught due to unsupervised children getting under your feet, not the hotels fault, but we felt the restaurant could have been better arranged to help this situation. All the food, however, was very good. There wasn't one dish I tried I didn't like.

The resort, overall, seemed to be run quite well being generally clean & tidy. The entertainment was ok but my partner, who'd been before, said there wasn't as much of it as there'd been on her previous visits, she also said the new pool wasn't as good as the old one but I'll have to take her word for that as I never used either.

The children in our party (there were 11 of us) seemed to have a thoroughly good time, indeed they didn't want to go home.

So all in all a good bank holiday weekend break but, it has to be said, the unusually good weather helped immensely.

168,702,408,Bognor,4,"Fun Easter break and lovely hotel Wave We spent a Monday to Friday here in the first week of April. The weather was brutal but we really enjoyed the place. The resort itself was quiet, no queuing for anything really and we were totally impressed by the hotel which was much better than expected. The rooms were very well planned with attention to detail - they thought of everything really.

All the staff were nice, cheerful and helpful apart from the miserable unfriendly man running the virtual reality rides.

We were unfortunate to be there for some very cold weather and this is one of the only niggles really - the resort did not respond to the change in temperature and a lot of places were cold. In particular the lovely lounge bar in the Wave hotel where we would have spent a lot of time (and money) was absolutely freezing. We actually left the resort a few times because it was uncomfortable and otherwise would have stayed there to eat or drink.

We had the old pool for its final outing and it was fine. The kids loved it and while it might look a bit tired, everyone enjoyed it.

The food was as expected. The buffet dining was poor although we only had breakfast there. It was quite expensive but the selection was immense. However, everything was poor quality and cheap ingredients. I would recommend the omelettes which are cooked to order and the fresh fruit and pancakes. Nothing else.

The fish and chip restaurant was fantastic, only a bit more expensive that you might expect but if you do the takeaway and eat on the tables outside, it is cheaper (but not in the sleet and hail!). Papa Johns was Papa Johns - totally fine as you would expect. The very cosy and nice looking coffee shop is extremely uncomfortable with hard seating - not somewhere to spend an hour with a coffee and a book while the kids go off so I used the hotel lounge bar which I really liked. Apart from the cold.

The activities were good value we thought with a £12.00 multi-activity ticket; we bought a few of these and the kids did everything almost. There was really so much to do, no one was bored and any down time was a welcome break and not a 'run out of things to do'. We did visit the beach just to say we had, but it was so cold that it was a fleeting visit. In nicer weather I would have explored the town and coastal area further but honestly there is enough in-resort to keep everyone occupied.

Rooms were comfortable, warm, nice bedding and comfortable beds. The kids loved their little cabin room and the balcony was nice to have. That is definitely worth paying extra for BUT, you really do have to complain about people smoking out there. Even though it clearly says it is not allowed, people still do it so if you have your doors open assuming the sleet stopped for a bit (we did have one nice day!) then you can enjoy your smoke filled room.

All in all this was outstanding value for money for a 5 day break for 4 people.

What we didn't like:
I think you might get the idea that we found the hotel lounge cold! enough said.
the gorgeous looking breakfast hot berry crumble is awful, don't be tempted
Pitchers of cocktails.....seem like great value for money but they are VERY weak
wine selection is dire, bring your own.
BIG DISLIKE: The pool closes at 5pm. This I found to be a real thumbs down. The pool (and resort?) is open to the public on a day basis for a fee so the pool can be very busy. For residents the pool is included in the price and so should be open later for us - this is really unfair to paying guests as we are all then forced into activities which are charged as extra when the children could really enjoy the pool with fewer people, later into the evening. Same with the fair, closes at 5pm and does not open until 11am. Adults also are customers! we might like a bit of a quiet swim earlier in the morning or later in the evening. This would be so much nicer if we could use it in a more flexible time frame. I know you need time to clean it but other resorts manage it with no problems (Centre parcs open 10am to 9pm). This looks like profiteering to me as these are two 'free' activities

Finally a good to know: If you book a twin room be aware that the beds are not standard 3ft singles but 2.6ft - for a fully grown adult they are very narrow. I went with my adult daughter and two younger kids.

Overall, loved our stay and will go back.

Building more accommodation they could really do with expanding the entertainment, especially the shows you need a ticket for as people still queue up to 2 hours before a show just to get a seat ( this has made us avoid ticketed shows for the past 4 years )

170,715,417,Bognor,4,"Day visit from Haven Pagham holiday maker Swimming pool - If there is a better swimming pool in UK Id like to know where it is as Butlins new area is superb. Lots of rides, indoor helter skelter, rapids (which go outside!) 2 slides which you almost take off from on the bottom part (so lookout!) inflatable raft slide for up to 3 persons is great family fun (not scary in anyway) , the fastest slide which didnt really cut it for me as expected more and a number of toddler slides running into very shallow water. Fantastic changing areas with huge family cubicles. Gripes are firstly the water temperature is too cold only by 2 degrees or so but noticeable, more importantly air temperature is too low. Kids shivering and adults walking round with arms crossed. I would of thought spending £120m on a swimming pool would buy you top of range heating maybe even negative air pressure so cold air from changing room especially when standing at helter skelter pours into swimming pool and cold air from rapids. The rapids also needs a warning sign that the last pool when re-entering building is 4 times deeper than depth of ride. Many kids got caught out by this sudden change in depth and inhaled water, there are 2 guards in pool but they didnt stop it happening as they naturally are there to help those in trouble so it needs highlighting with signs. Risk assessment here seems lacking. Fairground is excellent many free rides. Food - Finally Butlins gets a fish & chip shop! but food onsite is still generally expensive and hit n miss. Carlyles Cafe and Lobster Pot in Felpham just 300/400 yards away are top class. (The former is cheaper) Red Coats - well compared to Havens version they just dont cut it. If youve been to both you'll know the difference. Most walk around without smiles, look far too formal and are unapproachable.

We actually came to stay here as we weren't happy with some of the things at Skegness. We paid far more to stay here, so we were expecting better things. I will summarise our thoughts. Before I start just a bit more info. The group ranges from 10 years to 68 years. We always go half board. We use to pay for housekeeping. We usually stay in Silver Chalet.
So the good:
Receptionists in the hotel were outstanding.
Under floor heating in swimming pool was very good.
Bags for wet kit in swimming pool.
Dryer for wet costumes.
Compact site so less walking.
Showers in new pool are good.
Good slides and rapids.
Good entertainment
Family rooms in the wave Hotel are very good.
Great customer service throughout the site.
The Deck is extremely good. Worth upgrading.
Headphone Jack's in bunks was great.

The Bad:
Queue to check in at the hotel was very slow.
Coral beach tired, needs redecorating.
No where to actually swim in the new pool.
Amber on the rides needs some diversity training, she was extremely rude to a young boy with Downs Syndrome, a complete lack of respect.
The tickets for the shows should be available for evening shows as well as daytime.
Children's room in hotel is tight, if you are tall be careful bumping your heads.
The new pool is on the far edge so if you are in Wave, it is quite far.

173,739,428,Bognor,4,"Ocean hotel weekend, would have been 5 stars if not for a few issues This is a bit of a long review, but after reading many useful reviews before booking, I'd like to return the favour. First part is about the hotel, 2nd about the resort itself. Have just returned from a weekend break staying in an Atlantis Room on the 2nd floor of the Ocean Hotel. We paid for a sea view but didn't upgrade to a top floor room as I'd read a great tip on here about the top floor having no shelter on the balcony if it rained, so we decided we'd stick to a lower floor. This worked out well, as the balcony was sheltered nicely from the wind too, so lovely to sit out on.
My husband and I went with our adult son and his 5yr old daughter- they shared the twin bed kids den. The beds aren't bad sizes, but not advisable for anyone over 6ft. The kids room doesn't have a door, but there is a wall mounted tv, funky decor and mood lighting. We only had a storage box under one bed, not both like I think you are supposed to get, but this wasn't an issue. The main space had a double bed with units either side. The padded headboard has very funky mood lighting above and the beds were comfortable. The bed also has storage space underneath ( I didn't discover this until the 2nd night) handy for putting suitcases or bags. You get a few hangers for the wardrobe, plenty of shelving space, a 3 drawer chest unit (under the wall mounted tv) a dressing table area with mirror and stool and hairdryer. There is a personal safe, iron and ironing board and mini fridge ( we fitted 1 litre cartons of milk, 500ml bottles of water in there fine) The room also has 2 chairs and a side table. There are plenty of lights and the curtains are nice and heavy. The patio doors lead out on to the balcony, where there were 4 chairs and a table. Our room looked out over the new pool and fairground and you could also see the sea. I was really pleased with the room, Years ago we stayed in gold apartments but nowadays I just didn't fancy that and the hotel appealed to us. It's set out really well- luckily the lifts were working, but as we were on the 2nd floor it wouldn't be a problem. We didn't book a dining package, but we did pay to have breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning, which was good. I can't fault the breakfast- massive choice- the omelette station is fab ( omelettes made to order) Staff are lovely there, some other diners not so though ( families piling up plates, making loads of mess, leaving loads) Again it's a personal choice and I'm a bit of a snob! That said if I come again, I'd probably book the breakfast dining package as I think it is actually a good deal. I think the hotel is lovely and the staff are so friendly and helpful. We unfortunately had to make a few trips to reception to get a few problems fixed and they were always lovely. Our main problems were the tv's. The kids tv didn't work at all and we were awoken at 3.10am by our main tv coming on really loudly on the news channel ( a previous guest had clearly decided to play a joke on someone and give them an early morning wake up) My husband went to reception to explain the issue Saturday morning and they sent someone up within 10 mins from housekeeping. They got the kids tv to work and after a bit of hassle were confident they had reset our tv to stop the alarm. Saturday evening our tv decided it only wanted to show 2 channels, we spoke to reception and they sent a tech up who changed the lead and sorted that problem, Brilliant! However Sunday morning we were again awoken at 3.10am by the tv coming on loudly. So loudly it woke all of us up this time. Back to reception who were horrified and promised to fix or change the tv ( we asked if they couldn't fix could they just take it out- as there is no off switch )Again they were lovely and promised to get it sorted. This morning ...you've guessed it- 3.10am wake up call courtesy of our tv. Again staff lovely and so apologetic, they offered to get the manager to talk to us, but we didn't want that. We just asked them to please change the tv so it doesn't happen to other guests. If it was to wake a small baby up that would ruin a families night. Credit to the staff, they were fab, but clearly this tv wasn't having it. It's a shame as I'm a rubbish sleeper so couldn't go back to sleep the first night and struggled the 2nd and 3rd after it happened, so I'm a bit shattered now I'm home. However if it hadn't been for the tv issue we wouldn't have any complaints with the hotel. The daily housekeeping is fab- as others have said the towel animals are a lovely touch. The power shower is great, lovely and powerful. We didn't use the spa as this weekend was about our granddaughter, but it looked really nice. The hotel has its own car park which we got a space in no hassle even though we didn't arrive until 5pm on the Friday. It's ideally located within a few minutes of the new pool, fairground and pavillion, so perfect for tired legs after an evening out. It's all very clean and tidy.
 The resort itself we hadn't visited in about 14 years- some things have changed, but not everything, so it was nice to recognize old favourites but also see the new improvements. The main one being the new pool- which opened the day before we arrived. It looks great and in many ways it is great- just a few teething problems. On our first visit the garden rapids weren't working , but the flumes, slides, kids pool and wave machine all were. It's a clever design- it doesn't look that big, but it never felt overcrowded when we visited , even though there were lots of people in there. The hotel guests get a special time slot of 8am-9am on Saturday, which is handy- there is also a tots slot I think too. The small kids slides on the Saturday had hardly any water around them and a dad warned us to catch our granddaughter as she came down the slide as his daughter had scraped all her leg up coming off the slide. On the Sunday when we visited we noticed the water was a lot deeper around these slides, which hopefully solved that issue. The little jacuzzi's were freezing and in a few parts of the pool it wasn't warm at all. The wave pool is though and it's really great- they play music when the waves are on and the kids love it. Unfortunately on Sunday this wasn't working. This time the garden rapids were- well sort of. Nothing rapid about them, we had to push ourselves along them and my husband scraped his back up on it. Also one of the big slides were it joins had the same issue- the way you come down it, can scratch your back up. I think they will get these teething problems fixed though. There is something for all ages there and it's definitely going to be an asset. The lifeguard ratio to guests (especially on Sunday) was very good. The changing rooms and lockers are great- I think there are going to be issues keeping the floors clean- there was a lot of hair and fluff all over them.
The fairground is good- it doesn't look like there is a lot there, but there are quite a few rides and except the go karts, they are all free. They had a late opening 7-9 on Sunday night which was nice- great atmosphere for the last night. I can see there are many more chargeable activities but there are still many free ones. We only paid for one extra activity- the skyline dance academy- which was a huge success. Our granddaughter loved it. It was supposed to be an hour long but lasted an hour and a half and her enjoyment made it well worth the money. Although not Easter yet, this was under the Easter breaks, so there were free activities like an egg hunt where you solve a puzzle and get a little chocolate egg ( with a Bonnie and Billy Bear egg cup)or the spring farmyard animals.
B-line passes-hmmm not sure about these. We bought them as none of us were up for long queues. They work well- sort of. You get in 15 mins before everyone else and have a separate queue. So although you still queue, there are only a certain amount of b-line passes, so you know if you arrive near the time you will get in, you shouldn't be in too big a queue. It worked great Friday night for Centre Stage for Sleeping Beauty. We got there about 10 mins before we were going to be allowed in and the queue wasn't bad at all. Here is the thing though..they set up chairs in rows at the front,then there are tables at the sides and then more tables on the next level further back. If you want to be in the front rows, then buy the passes. If you want a table- then it's not so certain. Friday night we got a great table, good view and probably wouldn't have without the pass. Saturday night we were first in the queue for Centre Stage and they had technical difficulties and the doors opened late. We were the first let in on the b-line passes, and got the table we wanted, but less than 5 minutes later we were joined at the next table by people from the general queue who quite loudly remarked what idiots people were who bought the b-line passes as they were a waste of money. Couldn't help but feel he was right. That night we saw Paddington and just as it finished we were all evacuated due to an issue ( no clue what). the whole pavillion was shut down and we were all led outside. No one knew how long it would be shut down, but staff said probably at least half an hour. It was freezing outside and there was no way we could leave a 5 year old hanging about in that, so we decided to go back to the hotel- that was the end of our evening. We heard late that night they did reopen it, but by then it was no good for us. I understand they had no option, but it felt like a waste of an evening ( and a waste of drinks we left behind) Sunday evening the granddaughter didn't want to watch Cirque de hilarious as she was totally taken with her dance academy experience and wanted to watch the skyline gang farewell show in the pavillion, so we didn't use the B-line passes. Had we wanted to they probably would have been worth it as the queues looked very long. So it's a bit hit and miss. I'm not going to say they are a waste of money, just have a think about what you are wanting from them- if its front row seats with minimum queuing and hassle, they are a good buy- if you will be going each night. For us they worked out expensive as Saturday night they weren't beneficial at all and Sunday we didn't use them.
The quality of the productions is really high. The stage sets and props etc are fab for Sleeping Beauty and Paddington. The Redcoats are also friendly and really talkative with the kids. Across the whole resort we never had a bad interaction with any staff.
Food wise, I'd throughly recommend the Pub & Kitchen. My husbands ribeye was as good as ones he has had at pricey steakhouses and reasonably priced too. For any of the restaurants I'd recommend you book if you want a popular time, like 6-7, otherwise you will be told there is a 45 min wait.
Overall it was a good weekend and the fact our granddaughter was unbelievably sad she was leaving this morning shows it was a winner. I feel Butlins is a rite of passage- I was taken as a kid each year, we took our kids and now we are back with our grandchild. Even if the hi-de-hi experience fills you with dread- give it a go. Maybe try the hotels as it's a different kind of experience and now I'm older definitely my preferred choice. I would have given it 5 stars if it hadn't been for the niggling issues.

174,740,428,Bognor,4,"Ocean hotel weekend, would have been 5 stars if not for a few issues This is a bit of a long review, but after reading many useful reviews before booking, I'd like to return the favour. First part is about the hotel, 2nd about the resort itself. Have just returned from a weekend break staying in an Atlantis Room on the 2nd floor of the Ocean Hotel. We paid for a sea view but didn't upgrade to a top floor room as I'd read a great tip on here about the top floor having no shelter on the balcony if it rained, so we decided we'd stick to a lower floor. This worked out well, as the balcony was sheltered nicely from the wind too, so lovely to sit out on.
My husband and I went with our adult son and his 5yr old daughter- they shared the twin bed kids den. The beds aren't bad sizes, but not advisable for anyone over 6ft. The kids room doesn't have a door, but there is a wall mounted tv, funky decor and mood lighting. We only had a storage box under one bed, not both like I think you are supposed to get, but this wasn't an issue. The main space had a double bed with units either side. The padded headboard has very funky mood lighting above and the beds were comfortable. The bed also has storage space underneath ( I didn't discover this until the 2nd night) handy for putting suitcases or bags. You get a few hangers for the wardrobe, plenty of shelving space, a 3 drawer chest unit (under the wall mounted tv) a dressing table area with mirror and stool and hairdryer. There is a personal safe, iron and ironing board and mini fridge ( we fitted 1 litre cartons of milk, 500ml bottles of water in there fine) The room also has 2 chairs and a side table. There are plenty of lights and the curtains are nice and heavy. The patio doors lead out on to the balcony, where there were 4 chairs and a table. Our room looked out over the new pool and fairground and you could also see the sea. I was really pleased with the room, Years ago we stayed in gold apartments but nowadays I just didn't fancy that and the hotel appealed to us. It's set out really well- luckily the lifts were working, but as we were on the 2nd floor it wouldn't be a problem. We didn't book a dining package, but we did pay to have breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning, which was good. I can't fault the breakfast- massive choice- the omelette station is fab ( omelettes made to order) Staff are lovely there, some other diners not so though ( families piling up plates, making loads of mess, leaving loads) Again it's a personal choice and I'm a bit of a snob! That said if I come again, I'd probably book the breakfast dining package as I think it is actually a good deal. I think the hotel is lovely and the staff are so friendly and helpful. We unfortunately had to make a few trips to reception to get a few problems fixed and they were always lovely. Our main problems were the tv's. The kids tv didn't work at all and we were awoken at 3.10am by our main tv coming on really loudly on the news channel ( a previous guest had clearly decided to play a joke on someone and give them an early morning wake up) My husband went to reception to explain the issue Saturday morning and they sent someone up within 10 mins from housekeeping. They got the kids tv to work and after a bit of hassle were confident they had reset our tv to stop the alarm. Saturday evening our tv decided it only wanted to show 2 channels, we spoke to reception and they sent a tech up who changed the lead and sorted that problem, Brilliant! However Sunday morning we were again awoken at 3.10am by the tv coming on loudly. So loudly it woke all of us up this time. Back to reception who were horrified and promised to fix or change the tv ( we asked if they couldn't fix could they just take it out- as there is no off switch )Again they were lovely and promised to get it sorted. This morning ...you've guessed it- 3.10am wake up call courtesy of our tv. Again staff lovely and so apologetic, they offered to get the manager to talk to us, but we didn't want that. We just asked them to please change the tv so it doesn't happen to other guests. If it was to wake a small baby up that would ruin a families night.

That said if I come again, I'd probably book the breakfast dining package as I think it is actually a good deal. I think the hotel is lovely and the staff are so friendly and helpful. We unfortunately had to make a few trips to reception to get a few problems fixed and they were always lovely. Our main problems were the tv's. The kids tv didn't work at all and we were awoken at 3.10am by our main tv coming on really loudly on the news channel ( a previous guest had clearly decided to play a joke on someone and give them an early morning wake up) My husband went to reception to explain the issue Saturday morning and they sent someone up within 10 mins from housekeeping. They got the kids tv to work and after a bit of hassle were confident they had reset our tv to stop the alarm. Saturday evening our tv decided it only wanted to show 2 channels, we spoke to reception and they sent a tech up who changed the lead and sorted that problem, Brilliant! However Sunday morning we were again awoken at 3.10am by the tv coming on loudly. So loudly it woke all of us up this time. Back to reception who were horrified and promised to fix or change the tv ( we asked if they couldn't fix could they just take it out- as there is no off switch )Again they were lovely and promised to get it sorted. This morning ...you've guessed it- 3.10am wake up call courtesy of our tv. Again staff lovely and so apologetic, they offered to get the manager to talk to us, but we didn't want that. We just asked them to please change the tv so it doesn't happen to other guests. If it was to wake a small baby up that would ruin a families night. Credit to the staff, they were fab, but clearly this tv wasn't having it. It's a shame as I'm a rubbish sleeper so couldn't go back to sleep the first night and struggled the 2nd and 3rd after it happened, so I'm a bit shattered now I'm home. However if it hadn't been for the tv issue we wouldn't have any complaints with the hotel. The daily housekeeping is fab- as others have said the towel animals are a lovely touch. The power shower is great, lovely and powerful. We didn't use the spa as this weekend was about our granddaughter, but it looked really nice. The hotel has its own car park which we got a space in no hassle even though we didn't arrive until 5pm on the Friday. It's ideally located within a few minutes of the new pool, fairground and pavillion, so perfect for tired legs after an evening out. It's all very clean and tidy.
 The resort itself we hadn't visited in about 14 years- some things have changed, but not everything, so it was nice to recognize old favourites but also see the new improvements. The main one being the new pool- which opened the day before we arrived. It looks great and in many ways it is great- just a few teething problems. On our first visit the garden rapids weren't working , but the flumes, slides, kids pool and wave machine all were. It's a clever design- it doesn't look that big, but it never felt overcrowded when we visited , even though there were lots of people in there. The hotel guests get a special time slot of 8am-9am on Saturday, which is handy- there is also a tots slot I think too. The small kids slides on the Saturday had hardly any water around them and a dad warned us to catch our granddaughter as she came down the slide as his daughter had scraped all her leg up coming off the slide. On the Sunday when we visited we noticed the water was a lot deeper around these slides, which hopefully solved that issue. The little jacuzzi's were freezing and in a few parts of the pool it wasn't warm at all. The wave pool is though and it's really great- they play music when the waves are on and the kids love it. Unfortunately on Sunday this wasn't working. This time the garden rapids were- well sort of. Nothing rapid about them, we had to push ourselves along them and my husband scraped his back up on it. Also one of the big slides were it joins had the same issue- the way you come down it, can scratch your back up. I think they will get these teething problems fixed though. There is something for all ages there and it's definitely going to be an asset. The lifeguard ratio to guests (especially on Sunday) was very good. The changing rooms and lockers are great- I think there are going to be issues keeping the floors clean- there was a lot of hair and fluff all over them.
The fairground is good- it doesn't look like there is a lot there, but there are quite a few rides and except the go karts, they are all free. They had a late opening 7-9 on Sunday night which was nice- great atmosphere for the last night. I can see there are many more chargeable activities but there are still many free ones. We only paid for one extra activity- the skyline dance academy- which was a huge success. Our granddaughter loved it. It was supposed to be an hour long but lasted an hour and a half and her enjoyment made it well worth the money. Although not Easter yet, this was under the Easter breaks, so there were free activities like an egg hunt where you solve a puzzle and get a little chocolate egg ( with a Bonnie and Billy Bear egg cup)or the spring farmyard animals.
B-line passes-hmmm not sure about these. We bought them as none of us were up for long queues. They work well- sort of. You get in 15 mins before everyone else and have a separate queue. So although you still queue, there are only a certain amount of b-line passes, so you know if you arrive near the time you will get in, you shouldn't be in too big a queue. It worked great Friday night for Centre Stage for Sleeping Beauty. We got there about 10 mins before we were going to be allowed in and the queue wasn't bad at all. Here is the thing though..they set up chairs in rows at the front,then there are tables at the sides and then more tables on the next level further back. If you want to be in the front rows, then buy the passes. If you want a table- then it's not so certain. Friday night we got a great table, good view and probably wouldn't have without the pass. Saturday night we were first in the queue for Centre Stage and they had technical difficulties and the doors opened late. We were the first let in on the b-line passes, and got the table we wanted, but less than 5 minutes later we were joined at the next table by people from the general queue who quite loudly remarked what idiots people were who bought the b-line passes as they were a waste of money. Couldn't help but feel he was right. That night we saw Paddington and just as it finished we were all evacuated due to an issue ( no clue what). the whole pavillion was shut down and we were all led outside. No one knew how long it would be shut down, but staff said probably at least half an hour. It was freezing outside and there was no way we could leave a 5 year old hanging about in that, so we decided to go back to the hotel- that was the end of our evening. We heard late that night they did reopen it, but by then it was no good for us. I understand they had no option, but it felt like a waste of an evening ( and a waste of drinks we left behind) Sunday evening the granddaughter didn't want to watch Cirque de hilarious as she was totally taken with her dance academy experience and wanted to watch the skyline gang farewell show in the pavillion, so we didn't use the B-line passes. Had we wanted to they probably would have been worth it as the queues looked very long. So it's a bit hit and miss. I'm not going to say they are a waste of money, just have a think about what you are wanting from them- if its front row seats with minimum queuing and hassle, they are a good buy- if you will be going each night. For us they worked out expensive as Saturday night they weren't beneficial at all and Sunday we didn't use them.
The quality of the productions is really high. The stage sets and props etc are fab for Sleeping Beauty and Paddington. The Redcoats are also friendly and really talkative with the kids. Across the whole resort we never had a bad interaction with any staff.
Food wise, I'd throughly recommend the Pub & Kitchen. My husbands ribeye was as good as ones he has had at pricey steakhouses and reasonably priced too. For any of the restaurants I'd recommend you book if you want a popular time, like 6-7, otherwise you will be told there is a 45 min wait.
Overall it was a good weekend and the fact our granddaughter was unbelievably sad she was leaving this morning shows it was a winner. I feel Butlins is a rite of passage- I was taken as a kid each year, we took our kids and now we are back with our grandchild. Even if the hi-de-hi experience fills you with dread- give it a go. Maybe try the hotels as it's a different kind of experience and now I'm older definitely my preferred choice. I would have given it 5 stars if it hadn't been for the niggling issues.

177,750,428,Bognor,4,"Ocean hotel weekend, would have been 5 stars if not for a few issues This is a bit of a long review, but after reading many useful reviews before booking, I'd like to return the favour. First part is about the hotel, 2nd about the resort itself. Have just returned from a weekend break staying in an Atlantis Room on the 2nd floor of the Ocean Hotel. We paid for a sea view but didn't upgrade to a top floor room as I'd read a great tip on here about the top floor having no shelter on the balcony if it rained, so we decided we'd stick to a lower floor. This worked out well, as the balcony was sheltered nicely from the wind too, so lovely to sit out on.
My husband and I went with our adult son and his 5yr old daughter- they shared the twin bed kids den. The beds aren't bad sizes, but not advisable for anyone over 6ft. The kids room doesn't have a door, but there is a wall mounted tv, funky decor and mood lighting. We only had a storage box under one bed, not both like I think you are supposed to get, but this wasn't an issue. The main space had a double bed with units either side. The padded headboard has very funky mood lighting above and the beds were comfortable. The bed also has storage space underneath ( I didn't discover this until the 2nd night) handy for putting suitcases or bags. You get a few hangers for the wardrobe, plenty of shelving space, a 3 drawer chest unit (under the wall mounted tv) a dressing table area with mirror and stool and hairdryer. There is a personal safe, iron and ironing board and mini fridge ( we fitted 1 litre cartons of milk, 500ml bottles of water in there fine) The room also has 2 chairs and a side table. There are plenty of lights and the curtains are nice and heavy. The patio doors lead out on to the balcony, where there were 4 chairs and a table. Our room looked out over the new pool and fairground and you could also see the sea. I was really pleased with the room, Years ago we stayed in gold apartments but nowadays I just didn't fancy that and the hotel appealed to us. It's set out really well- luckily the lifts were working, but as we were on the 2nd floor it wouldn't be a problem.

My husband and I went with our adult son and his 5yr old daughter- they shared the twin bed kids den. The beds aren't bad sizes, but not advisable for anyone over 6ft. The kids room doesn't have a door, but there is a wall mounted tv, funky decor and mood lighting. We only had a storage box under one bed, not both like I think you are supposed to get, but this wasn't an issue. The main space had a double bed with units either side. The padded headboard has very funky mood lighting above and the beds were comfortable. The bed also has storage space underneath ( I didn't discover this until the 2nd night) handy for putting suitcases or bags. You get a few hangers for the wardrobe, plenty of shelving space, a 3 drawer chest unit (under the wall mounted tv) a dressing table area with mirror and stool and hairdryer. There is a personal safe, iron and ironing board and mini fridge ( we fitted 1 litre cartons of milk, 500ml bottles of water in there fine) The room also has 2 chairs and a side table. There are plenty of lights and the curtains are nice and heavy. The patio doors lead out on to the balcony, where there were 4 chairs and a table. Our room looked out over the new pool and fairground and you could also see the sea. I was really pleased with the room, Years ago we stayed in gold apartments but nowadays I just didn't fancy that and the hotel appealed to us. It's set out really well- luckily the lifts were working, but as we were on the 2nd floor it wouldn't be a problem. We didn't book a dining package, but we did pay to have breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning, which was good. I can't fault the breakfast- massive choice- the omelette station is fab ( omelettes made to order) Staff are lovely there, some other diners not so though ( families piling up plates, making loads of mess, leaving loads) Again it's a personal choice and I'm a bit of a snob! That said if I come again, I'd probably book the breakfast dining package as I think it is actually a good deal. I think the hotel is lovely and the staff are so friendly and helpful. We unfortunately had to make a few trips to reception to get a few problems fixed and they were always lovely. Our main problems were the tv's. The kids tv didn't work at all and we were awoken at 3.10am by our main tv coming on really loudly on the news channel ( a previous guest had clearly decided to play a joke on someone and give them an early morning wake up) My husband went to reception to explain the issue Saturday morning and they sent someone up within 10 mins from housekeeping. They got the kids tv to work and after a bit of hassle were confident they had reset our tv to stop the alarm. Saturday evening our tv decided it only wanted to show 2 channels, we spoke to reception and they sent a tech up who changed the lead and sorted that problem, Brilliant! However Sunday morning we were again awoken at 3.10am by the tv coming on loudly. So loudly it woke all of us up this time. Back to reception who were horrified and promised to fix or change the tv ( we asked if they couldn't fix could they just take it out- as there is no off switch )Again they were lovely and promised to get it sorted. This morning ...you've guessed it- 3.10am wake up call courtesy of our tv. Again staff lovely and so apologetic, they offered to get the manager to talk to us, but we didn't want that. We just asked them to please change the tv so it doesn't happen to other guests. If it was to wake a small baby up that would ruin a families night. Credit to the staff, they were fab, but clearly this tv wasn't having it. It's a shame as I'm a rubbish sleeper so couldn't go back to sleep the first night and struggled the 2nd and 3rd after it happened, so I'm a bit shattered now I'm home. However if it hadn't been for the tv issue we wouldn't have any complaints with the hotel. The daily housekeeping is fab- as others have said the towel animals are a lovely touch. The power shower is great, lovely and powerful. We didn't use the spa as this weekend was about our granddaughter, but it looked really nice. The hotel has its own car park which we got a space in no hassle even though we didn't arrive until 5pm on the Friday. It's ideally located within a few minutes of the new pool, fairground and pavillion, so perfect for tired legs after an evening out. It's all very clean and tidy.
 The resort itself we hadn't visited in about 14 years- some things have changed, but not everything, so it was nice to recognize old favourites but also see the new improvements. The main one being the new pool- which opened the day before we arrived. It looks great and in many ways it is great- just a few teething problems. On our first visit the garden rapids weren't working , but the flumes, slides, kids pool and wave machine all were. It's a clever design- it doesn't look that big, but it never felt overcrowded when we visited , even though there were lots of people in there. The hotel guests get a special time slot of 8am-9am on Saturday, which is handy- there is also a tots slot I think too. The small kids slides on the Saturday had hardly any water around them and a dad warned us to catch our granddaughter as she came down the slide as his daughter had scraped all her leg up coming off the slide. On the Sunday when we visited we noticed the water was a lot deeper around these slides, which hopefully solved that issue. The little jacuzzi's were freezing and in a few parts of the pool it wasn't warm at all. The wave pool is though and it's really great- they play music when the waves are on and the kids love it. Unfortunately on Sunday this wasn't working. This time the garden rapids were- well sort of. Nothing rapid about them, we had to push ourselves along them and my husband scraped his back up on it. Also one of the big slides were it joins had the same issue- the way you come down it, can scratch your back up. I think they will get these teething problems fixed though. There is something for all ages there and it's definitely going to be an asset. The lifeguard ratio to guests (especially on Sunday) was very good. The changing rooms and lockers are great- I think there are going to be issues keeping the floors clean- there was a lot of hair and fluff all over them.
The fairground is good- it doesn't look like there is a lot there, but there are quite a few rides and except the go karts, they are all free. They had a late opening 7-9 on Sunday night which was nice- great atmosphere for the last night. I can see there are many more chargeable activities but there are still many free ones. We only paid for one extra activity- the skyline dance academy- which was a huge success. Our granddaughter loved it. It was supposed to be an hour long but lasted an hour and a half and her enjoyment made it well worth the money. Although not Easter yet, this was under the Easter breaks, so there were free activities like an egg hunt where you solve a puzzle and get a little chocolate egg ( with a Bonnie and Billy Bear egg cup)or the spring farmyard animals.
B-line passes-hmmm not sure about these. We bought them as none of us were up for long queues. They work well- sort of. You get in 15 mins before everyone else and have a separate queue. So although you still queue, there are only a certain amount of b-line passes, so you know if you arrive near the time you will get in, you shouldn't be in too big a queue. It worked great Friday night for Centre Stage for Sleeping Beauty. We got there about 10 mins before we were going to be allowed in and the queue wasn't bad at all. Here is the thing though..they set up chairs in rows at the front,then there are tables at the sides and then more tables on the next level further back. If you want to be in the front rows, then buy the passes. If you want a table- then it's not so certain. Friday night we got a great table, good view and probably wouldn't have without the pass. Saturday night we were first in the queue for Centre Stage and they had technical difficulties and the doors opened late. We were the first let in on the b-line passes, and got the table we wanted, but less than 5 minutes later we were joined at the next table by people from the general queue who quite loudly remarked what idiots people were who bought the b-line passes as they were a waste of money. Couldn't help but feel he was right. That night we saw Paddington and just as it finished we were all evacuated due to an issue ( no clue what). the whole pavillion was shut down and we were all led outside. No one knew how long it would be shut down, but staff said probably at least half an hour. It was freezing outside and there was no way we could leave a 5 year old hanging about in that, so we decided to go back to the hotel- that was the end of our evening. We heard late that night they did reopen it, but by then it was no good for us. I understand they had no option, but it felt like a waste of an evening ( and a waste of drinks we left behind) Sunday evening the granddaughter didn't want to watch Cirque de hilarious as she was totally taken with her dance academy experience and wanted to watch the skyline gang farewell show in the pavillion, so we didn't use the B-line passes. Had we wanted to they probably would have been worth it as the queues looked very long. So it's a bit hit and miss. I'm not going to say they are a waste of money, just have a think about what you are wanting from them- if its front row seats with minimum queuing and hassle, they are a good buy- if you will be going each night. For us they worked out expensive as Saturday night they weren't beneficial at all and Sunday we didn't use them.
The quality of the productions is really high. The stage sets and props etc are fab for Sleeping Beauty and Paddington. The Redcoats are also friendly and really talkative with the kids. Across the whole resort we never had a bad interaction with any staff.
Food wise, I'd throughly recommend the Pub & Kitchen. My husbands ribeye was as good as ones he has had at pricey steakhouses and reasonably priced too. For any of the restaurants I'd recommend you book if you want a popular time, like 6-7, otherwise you will be told there is a 45 min wait.
Overall it was a good weekend and the fact our granddaughter was unbelievably sad she was leaving this morning shows it was a winner. I feel Butlins is a rite of passage- I was taken as a kid each year, we took our kids and now we are back with our grandchild. Even if the hi-de-hi experience fills you with dread- give it a go. Maybe try the hotels as it's a different kind of experience and now I'm older definitely my preferred choice. I would have given it 5 stars if it hadn't been for the niggling issues.

The new pool complex is brilliant and so do wonderful for the children. Second day the pool was freezing and the changing rooms was freezing on both occasions.
Watch out for the rapids..it's not rapid going around infact young age to push yourself round.. however the last slide is awful...it practically drowns everyone.. so they have 2 lifeguards to catch you...they need to sort that out!!!

183,777,453,Bognor,5,"Tots week Just returned from an amazing 5 day holiday at butlin’s with my 2 1/5 year old and partner we had an amazing time.

The swimming pool was fantastic we went first thing in the morning and it was reasonably busy but we all had a a great time in there and also went the afternoon and it was quiet and they had the wave machine on and the flumes where on top we have a great time. They had little tikes ships for younger kids to play on and loads of buckets and watering cans for kids to play with. But for the size of the resort they defiantly need two pools.

The kids rides that where placed inside where absolutely amazing my little girl loved them we couldn’t get her off them the staff running them were outstanding with the kids they went beyond to keep the kids entertained during the ride and if it wasn’t busy they let the kids stay on.

The outdoor parks where great and they where soft flooring so if kids fell over it wasn’t as bad like if they fell over one pavement.

Outdoor funfair looked amazing but didn’t spend time in there as my little girl was too young.

We stayed in the wave hotel and it was amazing very spacious kids bed was very comfy and had it’s on little t.v and had a relaxing blue light which seemed to help my little girl sleep so much better so will defiantly look at getting something for my girls room at home. Kitchen and livening area was very spacious and well equipped t.v was quite small for the distance it was from the sofa but we wasn’t really in the room much and if we was we would just watch telly in bed so weren’t a major issue. Main bed room was very big and very comfy own hair dryer which was a bonus as I forgot mine.

Justin fletcher was absoloultly amazing my little girl loves him and he was very funny and entertains for the kids. We also watch Paddington bear which was really good. Sid Salone was amazing for when we he was on in the evening. Kids disco could have been a bit better but the kids liked it. Queuing to get in for Justin was crazy we joined the queue about 12 and it was t too bad but within 10 mins of standing it quickly picked up but we still got good seats there was a pillar on front but didn’t disrupt us watching the show and there was a small screen to look at if you didn’t want to miss it but there moved all over stage so didn’t make a difference. Paddington queue was the same but there was less people watching Paddington then there was Justin.

We ate out twice as we done self catering as I was easier for us with a young child. We ate in the beachcomber inn which was delicious. Friendly staff and quick service. The food came out quick and the kids menu was good and you got a kids starter for veg stick and bread sticks and dip which was good while the kids were waiting for the mains made it very easier. I found it reasonable price normal pub grub price. We also ate in the diner which was nice too donthibk you need to get there early for a good meal as they shut at half 6 and seemed to rush to get the rest of the meals out for closing time. Also the same price and the beachcomber inn. They all done similar foods.

Overall a great holiday and would definitely go back.

185,790,459,Bognor,1,"""carefully curated to fit in with your tot’s routine"" - yeah right We took our 18 month year old daughter to Butlins last weekend. It was booked as a JUST FOR TOTS weekend, which was advertised as being 'carefully curated to fit a tot's routine', and that there was no need to worry. It was set up to allow for 'enjoying quality time with your mini-me's'.

On paper, this seemed to be true. Amazing acts such as the Teletubbies during the day and Justin Fletcher in the evening which our little one loves made it seem like a no brainer. We took up a variety of offers and ended up with a 'sort out your own food but everything else is covered' total of around £450.

When we got there, the weather was a bit lousy. No one can do much about that. The staff as we entered the parking were happy and helpful, as were the staff on reception who let us know about the activities on whilst we were there. This was when we were told that even though Justin had a couple of shows on, we HAD to take the 7 o'clock showing - which is normally bed time for our little one so already not QUITE fitting our routine... but it was a holiday so we let that slide.

We then proceeded to our Seaside Apartments which we had paid extra for as they were sold as ""Perfect for families"". What they don't tell you is to enter the apartments (if you don't have a ground floor one), you first have to go up a metal spiralling fire escape to get to your floor. We looked around and saw countless families struggling to the 1st and 2nd floors with kids under arms, prams, suitcases and more. Not what I could ever describe as kid-friendly, and more than that what I WOULD describe as unsafe. Due to the bad weather these metal steps were really slippy and at several times over the holiday we had some near slips - particularly when bringing the heavier luggage/prams in and out of the apartment.

Inside the apartment itself was of OK quality, and the living room was comfy. The twin bedroom which we'd specifically booked for a travel cot however was not big enough for one. We ended up having to completely re-arrange all the furniture in there ourselves including stacking some bedside tables to make JUST enough room for the cot.

We also unfortunately were unable to find a room with a bath and there was only a shower - although we were told toddler baths were available to rent from Butlins when we got there. When we went to enquire about this however we were told these were more for tiny babies and would not fit our 18 mo. Therefore an awkward standing-in-the-shower-clutching-the-little-one was needed.

We had arrived on a Friday and saw there was a showing of the Teletubbies in the pavillion starting in 45 minutes - not many people had turned up to the resort for the weekend yet so we strolled down and it seemed relatively quiet... until we got to the central stage. Parents and their children including prams, bags and all sorts had already crowded the front of the stage and meant that our 18 mo had to stand with us at the back near the cafe. This was 45 minutes until anything else happened on the stage - there was no pre-entertainment to entertain the under 5s. If you have a little one of this age you might well know that keeping their attention for this long is near impossible and often results in a cranky child by the time the fun started.

We hoped this was just a one off, but unfortunately this was just the beginning of a heap of problems for us.

The next morning we were up and out of the room just before 9 and had read there was a Toddlers Relaxing swimming session where in the brochure it stated slides etc would be turned off so it was as relaxing for young children as possible.

However when we arrived we were greeted to a huge queue where someone near the front told us they had been waiting 45 minutes as they were operating a one-in-one-out process to get families in to the pool. There was a viewing window of the pool and it looked like a scene from 28 days later there were hoards of people. Parents were forced to congregate standing at the sides of the pool whilst their kids got to put their feet in, but more than that, all of the slides etc were fully operational meaning 4-5 year olds were running up and down and making it extremely difficult for families with smaller children to enjoy themselves. Because of this we bailed on the idea and left the swimming pool.

There were some elements of the pavilion that did operate well. The small rides behind the main stage such as the mini rollercoaster etc had quick queues and the staff did well to always ensure kids were strapped in properly. We ended up spending a good amount of time on here.

We attempted to get in to the soft play area too. As my daughter is only small we were restricted to the left half of the soft play specifically reserved for small children. However this part of the soft play had no ramps, or even steps. The only way to the upper level was through some holes leading to higher up shelves. This was NOT something that most 2 year olds were able to climb on their own, so parents were all heading up it as well to help. However this meant there was a huge blockage of kids ascending/descending down the one way up or down (apart from a slide) and it genuinely took us 25 minutes just to get up the first part of the soft play. Once up it was one level with a slide but also some steep drops that weren't safe for young kids anyway. We went down the slide and left the soft play too.

I understand some people may read this and think I'm moaning but this was for us, an expensive holiday, which we only took up because it was advertised as being a stress free curated holiday built around toddlers. Our daughter spent a huge amount of this trip agitated at having to wait in queues and not understanding she couldn't just run off as we'd lose our place for certain things.

The worst of this was of course the main event of Justin. As already mentioned we had the 7 o'clock showing allocated to us. On the back of the ticket it noted that doors opened from 6 o'clock. It also stated very clearly there would be no queue jumping (even to the point they wouldn't allow someone else in your family to hold a place for the others). But how bad could the queue be? We were in the pavilion at 4.30... and the queue started. These earlybirds were ready to wait in a queue for 1 and a half hours to secure a seat... and then wait an additional hour sat on a chair with no stage entertainment and keep their kids busy. This might be possible with a 4/5 year old you can pass an iPad to, but not with an 18mo. There was no way we could possibly queue for that sort of time with her, and instead we got to the queue at about 5.55. The queue was built up half way around the pavilion and security staff were having to traffic people the right way. We were surrounded with parents holding squirming kids and often having to chase after them, come back to the queue and explain they weren't queue jumping.

We eventually got in at about 6.20 - 40 minutes before the show was due to start. ALL the front seating area was full. Staff were on hand to direct you to empty seats but naturally these were all at the back, and the ones we were sent to were situated behind a huge pillar. We could just make out the stage and as this was meant to be a fun interactive sing/dance along experience for my daughter I was gutted that we were doing it from practically the back of the room.

A crowd next to us had 'reserved' a long string of seating for their friends by putting bags/coats on them and refused to relinquish any for our daughter to be able to see the stage without constantly switching from either side when Justin went behind the pillar in our way.

The actual show was good - and I don't want any of this to come down to Justin's performance, or even the staff at the event. They were genuinely nice and tried to help.

However the overall organisation and I suppose sheer number of people they had crammed in was out of control. It meant that a good 50% of people in there were not getting the experience they wanted. Which may have been alright for the group of wasted dads sat next to us who weren't even facing the stage, but for us who had come specifically for our daughter, it was tragic.

On Sunday, we made the decision that this had been a disaster. Everyone was tired and cranky, especially my daughter, and we came home over a day earlier than we should have done.

I've never left a holiday early before, and I've definitely never felt relieved to be leaving one. But on this occasion it was the right thing to do. Unless something fundamental was to change in the way these weekends are booked/managed I don't think we will ever be coming back.

This was my first visit to Butlin’s & in honesty my expectations were low but this was all about time together as a family. Well Butlin’s you surpassed expectations and the Just for Tots break was brilliant!

From the moment you arrive the resort team are helpful, smiling & just get you in the holiday mood - living just 30mins away from Bognor I never expected to feel like I was away from home but the Butlin’s experience sucks you in.

The shows were hit and miss, Justin Fletcher was great but some others were a bit amateur. However my 3yr old loved them all & that’s all that mattered.

Being aimed at the under5s, the weekend was full of other activities such as craft workshops, Little Tykes cars and a little pop up library.

Even on rainy days we were kept busy as there is so much indoors.

We did dine around so could eat at our choice of restaurants. The Diner was chaotic but good and even the hotel buffet was of a very good standard. Food constantly refreshed and lots of healthy choices for children.

I can’t recommend the B-line passes enough. Well worth it to beat the queues at the pool & for Justin!

I’ll leave a separate review about our hotel, The Shoreline, which was the perfect place to stay with a little one.

We will go back & I never thought I’d be saying that!

I stayed in Silver apartment. The room was average, bathroom had no towels ( which was called out) but with £100 a night it doesn't sound great. The shower was really bad (no water flow). No one cleaned the rooms during the stay. I had opted for the budget stay but didn't realize I'll miss out on basics. The bed linen and curtains were clean and the heating worked fine.

Pool:
The pool was average with warm water but the shower area was freezing. Not sure why it wasn't temperature controlled.

Food:
 I had chosen food court dining and was very basic. Certainly not worth the amount I paid for and hardly had any options for vegetarians. The most important point is that dinner closes at 6:30 pm. Not sure, if people have dinner at 6 during a holiday. However the live shows were good and
The resort was clean.

The entertainment was excellent, Bobby Davro was a scream and Black Lace got everyone up and dancing. We had a trip to the spa and this helped to soothe achy feet and bones from dancing. The ice room was something I had never experienced. I would highly recommend the extra cost of visiting the spa.

The food was good with a fair choice and the chefs were available to help with dietary advice. The staff on a whole as you would expect were friendly and helpful.

Great value for money and I am highly likely to return. Great for family and group holidays.

190,819,472,Bognor,2,"Disappointing half term break We booked a Gold apartment for 3 adults & 2 children February half term and were very disappointed: The accommodation smelt stale and was not clean when we moved in with a thick layer of dust on the dishwasher, rubbish down the back of the sofas, dirt, elastic bands and clips behind the bedroom drawers and stained bedroom curtains. We had only 1 dishwasher tablet left for the whole week and dirty wet towels we left on the floor were folded for us to reuse. We asked Guest Services what we might expect from daily housekeeping which we had paid for and were told only beds were made & bins emptied unless we requested otherwise. This is hardly daily housekeeping and we never saw the housekeeper to ask for more cleaning. Reception staff were apathetic to our complaints and so we bought some cleaning materials ourselves to get the job done. We could only access the cutlery drawer by opening the fridge door first (bizarre) and the fridge had door struts missing so the milk fell out every time it was opened! Entertainment and site facilities were generally good so it’s a great pity that the accommodation was such a let down. We filled in a satisfaction questionnaire and requested feedback but have received no response to date -again disappointing.

191,824,478,Bognor,3,"Soul Weekender Feb 2019 The accommodation was not what we paid for or what was advertised on the Butlins website. We paid for a sea view apartment with a balcony, but instead got an apartment overlooking a busy roundabout, without balcony. We couldn't have been any further away from the main arena than where our rather inappropriately named (waterfront apartment) was situated. We all felt that it might be a good idea for Butlins to provide umbrellas for those on the outskirts of their resorts, as we got absolutely drenched walking the half mile back to our apartment. Would 100% go again just make sure you get what you book. We all had a fantastic time, the entertainment was great, the venues were perfect, and accommodation was clean and tidy.

193,826,483,Bognor,5,"Fantastic! Stayed here for three nights in February. We stayed in a Deluxe Room in Oyster Bay which was great. The room came with a dedicated car parking space just outside. Downstairs there is a patio area with the patio doors opening into the living room with a fridge and tea/coffee making facilities. Upstairs there is a twin bedroom with a balcony and a bathroom. The room is also really close to the main resort area, which is very convenient. We didn't choose a dining plan as we wanted to have freedom of choice for the restaurants. Our favourite eating place was the Beachcomber Inn. The staff are so friendly and helpful and the food comes our super quick and is of good quality. We ate in Papa John's one night, but it was very chaotic and it took a long time to get served. We also ate in The Diner for lunch one day, which we really enjoyed. Again, the staff were great and the food was delicious and served quickly. We mostly stayed in the Centre Stage for evening entertainment. We tried Reds one night, but definitely preferred Centre Stage. Thoroughly enjoyed the entertainment on offer. The Sleeping Beauty panto was laugh out loud, as was Cirque du Hilarious. Great music entertainment too, with Abba and Little Mix tributes. Loved the chilled out vibe of Lounge Rosso to enjoy cocktails and softails. We tended to use the swimming pool between 3pm and 5pm when it was a little bit quieter, still busy, but not too manic. We liked the lazy river and the wave pool, and we will definitely be re-visiting to try out the new swimming pool that is opening. Unfortunately one of the fairground rides was closed due to technical difficulties when we were there, but we did enjoy the ones that were open. In particular, we enjoyed it when the fairground was open late on the Sunday evening. We booked four payable activities when we were there....zip wire, segways, high ropes and archery. It was just me and my daughter, so she roped me into doing all of the activites, meaning I was the only adult on all of them apart from the archery haha. The activities staff were absolutely fantastic, they made it lots of fun and made us feel very welcome. The arcades are great, lots of choice, although it's easy to spend a fortune collecting tickets in exchange for prizes! We didn't cash in our tickets this time, we will save them for our next visit....which will be very soon!! In conclusion, absolutely loved this place, thank you Butlins!

194,830,491,Bognor,4,"We need a Butlins abroad! We need a Butlins abroad! Fantastic hotels, fantastic service fantastic entertainment and activities.

We stayed in the Wave Hotel on 6th floor again it is a well-designed hotel with a separate bedroom area for the kids with TV DVD players for both bunk beds and in the main bedroom, it has a fridge and tea and coffee making area and a safe so all you need in a family hotel room; I wish other hotels had this layout on offer.

It was very clean and the cleaner was very conscientious and dealt with the small issue we had very quickly, what she did with making the towel animals and my child’s teddy bear was very nice also.

The food was good we had a dine around option but mainly ate in The Deck restaurant but had breakfast in The Ocean and Shoreline hotels which was more less the same but with less people, the staff cleaned the tables thoroughly with sanitiser which is needed with the children serving themselves and putting their hands everywhere!

The things they need to improve on is the queues for The Centre Stage and Reds, queues collect prizes from the arcade machines and queues in general, I have never seen such an orderly queue in a bar before, I found it very funny and British but it worked and was nice to see people not trying to push in and just being nice.

They could also improve on having a ticket, to get a ticket to give a ticket to use an activity it seems to be waste of paper and time and queuing! They should do online bookings for these things and you just bring the booking details to the activity cutting out needing to queue at the Leisure Hub.

I have a 13 year old and a 11 year old I would have like to see more group activities for teenagers at the start of the stay so she could make friends. The karting activity at 9am in the morning is not ideal for teenagers later in the day would be better. Also, I have girls and would like to see at least one sporting activity like football for girls only to encourage them to join in as these things seem to be always dominated by the boys which could be off putting for some girls.

All in all, we found the activities good and well organised and all of the staff at Butlins friendly and approachable.

We will be back!

Once we were installed in the apartment it was great. There was a Butlins employee walking around checking things were ok and she brought us some towels which were missing from the apartment. Apartments are very well appointed with full kitchen, dine area and lounge area. 2 bedrooms with wardrobe space and nice shower room. Cannot be faulted.

200,854,508,Bognor,4,"With friends and family. Long weekend plus day guests 12 years running we have now visited in February half term for a few days by the sea. Seen quite a variety of standards etc over the years.
This year:
Stopped in the ocean hotel. Clean tidy fresh and welcoming. Sea view definitely a good choice. Accommodating to minor disability requests of this year. Staff usual combination of mad, friendly and pretty efficient. Site clean and tidy. Rooms - added little touches of swan towels and rose folded toilet roll ends cant help but lmake u smile.

Definitely not the all inclusive type of holiday that it used to be. Very little now included in price especially as kids teenagers. Funfair outside and pool yes, but pretty much everything else additional- -at a minimum I believe of £8 per person per activity the monies soon add up. Thank goodness for pool cards for the weekend etc. For little kids the entertainment is definitely good value.

We used the spa as on previous occasions. £22 per person for 2 hours. A nice break away from the madness. Massages variable prices and quality (have had many experiences of massages over the years.) Staff accommodating to needs but perhaps not all staff as competent at imagination and skills unfortunately.

We chose the new dine around package, thinking more freedom and food choice, paid in advance so no nasty surprises. Or not!! Introduced apparently this weekend alongside new restaurant menus, quite complicated to use, staff not sure how to use and certainly not freedom to eat where u like! Refused entry to one restaurant as allocated to chalet area - and the dine around package is an upgrade!! On complaining to management this is hopefully being addressed. If could be used as suggested it can in the writing, a reasonable value addition to your package- but due to foods running out in the speciality restaurants (unreasonably) hidden supplements etc - definitely not a good buy. And watch junior menu aimed at hungry 14 year old boys. You certainly will need to be paying for extra!!

We would return because all in all I have a special affection for the madness of the British seaside and Butlins. It is close the sea and a small town. It feels safe for the whole family.

If I could offer one suggestion to Butlins apart from the heat of the rooms already covered above would be that 09:00 for breakfast starting is a bit on the late side for the early risers and a view that was shared amongst several guests

204,865,521,Bognor,1,"Christmas Fantasy We visited on 14th December 2018 for the Christmas Fantasy experience. We stayed in a self catering apartment in Guillemot way and it was very basic and in need of some thorough cleaning/repairs and TLC.
We arrived a bit late on the Friday and struggled to get parked, I had to get out leaving my partner with the car and kids in order to grab the keys and welcome pack to get in to our apartment as we couldn't find anywhere near to park. It was dark and I struggled to find guest services as I had never been there before (they do not have drive in check in desks like they do in Skegness).
We eventually found our apartment and it was really quite far for us to walk with all our belongings, a baby and two toddlers.
The parking situation is terrible, you have to get there early to get a space, we got there about 8pm and it was stressful trying to offload our belongings, our family and finding a space to park.
The first full day the weather was bad and all the outdoor activities were cancelled which meant that everyone was crammed in to the Skyline and it was horrific, the soft play area was bursting at the seams and we could see children getting knocked over by kids running past so we didn't let ours go in (much to their disappointment), there was not enough tables for us to sit down at and it was hard to see anything on stage as everyone was standing at the sides so you couldn't see anything let alone the toddlers trying to see. It was a struggle walking past as there were people EVERYWHERE trying to watch the entertainment and blocking the way past. There were queues for most things and a noticeable amount of parents having a lot to drink and ignoring their feral children, sometimes you would hear some of them swearing loudly and it made me feel uncomfortable as I don't want my children to be exposed to language like that.
In our guest pack we received tickets to see Santa in the Character theatre at 7pm on Saturday 15th Dec (which I thought was a bit late for a 2 and 4 year old), we assumed there was a show but when we got there we just got in to a long queue on the left hand side of the theatre, the kids called out for Santa who came out on a stage, then just sat down with the kids in their respective family groups on stage, had a brief chat with them, gave them a chocolate selection box and posed for a photo before being told to exit the other side of the stage. A couple of minutes at the most, pretty disappointing.
I have since found out from other people who went at the same time as us, that they all saw a Christmas show in the theatre or had a private Santa experience in his grotto so I'm baffled as to why we didn't receive either of those experiences.
We ate at Papa J's restaurant, it wasn't particularly busy and a few things were forgotten by the staff I.e. plates for the children despite asking for them twice so my partner and I ate our meals off the plates the starters came on. The food was absolutely delicious and fairly good value for money in comparison to some of the other places, I would definitely recommend eating here.
The swimming pool changing rooms were dirty, like really dirty and not necessarily from people using it that day but in desperate need of a deep clean. There were dirty nappies on the floor, bodily fluids including blood smears and bogeys on the walls and the floor was filthy.
I didn't see anyone cleaning in there at any stage, not even wiping the changing room floor which meant we had to put towels down in order to get changed and not get completely covered in dirt which meant our towels were so dirty we couldn't go swimming again during our stay.
We had forgotten the baby's swimming costume and had to look for a suitable suit, well there was only a pair of cheaply made trunks (nothing else in his size) and it cost us £10!!! I mean come on, his little swimsuit from Next didn't even cost that much, it really did take me aback but needs must. Well the trunks didn't fit him in the slightest they were massively too big and kept falling down, I feel that this aspect should be looked in to by Butlins as the trunks were incorrectly sized and extortionate, almost taking advantage of people who have no alternative.
During our time in the pool my partner took my little boy to the loo where a two young lads (one was a lifeguard and the other was dressed all in red) were having a loud conversation about one of the lads having an STI!!! Thankfully my little boy wasn't listening as we didn't fancy explaining to him what an STI was and it's a wholly inappropriate conversation to be having in a place mainly full of children.
By Sunday we had had enough so went off the site and went to Bognor beach and pier for the day and ate in a local pub, The Regis (Brewers fayre) which also had a soft play inside which the kids loved, we returned back to Butlins and decided to pack up and leave early (was due to stay until Monday).
All in all a bit of a let down and wouldn't recommend.

207,872,521,Bognor,1,"Christmas Fantasy We visited on 14th December 2018 for the Christmas Fantasy experience. We stayed in a self catering apartment in Guillemot way and it was very basic and in need of some thorough cleaning/repairs and TLC.
We arrived a bit late on the Friday and struggled to get parked, I had to get out leaving my partner with the car and kids in order to grab the keys and welcome pack to get in to our apartment as we couldn't find anywhere near to park. It was dark and I struggled to find guest services as I had never been there before (they do not have drive in check in desks like they do in Skegness).
We eventually found our apartment and it was really quite far for us to walk with all our belongings, a baby and two toddlers.
The parking situation is terrible, you have to get there early to get a space, we got there about 8pm and it was stressful trying to offload our belongings, our family and finding a space to park.
The first full day the weather was bad and all the outdoor activities were cancelled which meant that everyone was crammed in to the Skyline and it was horrific, the soft play area was bursting at the seams and we could see children getting knocked over by kids running past so we didn't let ours go in (much to their disappointment), there was not enough tables for us to sit down at and it was hard to see anything on stage as everyone was standing at the sides so you couldn't see anything let alone the toddlers trying to see. It was a struggle walking past as there were people EVERYWHERE trying to watch the entertainment and blocking the way past. There were queues for most things and a noticeable amount of parents having a lot to drink and ignoring their feral children, sometimes you would hear some of them swearing loudly and it made me feel uncomfortable as I don't want my children to be exposed to language like that.
In our guest pack we received tickets to see Santa in the Character theatre at 7pm on Saturday 15th Dec (which I thought was a bit late for a 2 and 4 year old), we assumed there was a show but when we got there we just got in to a long queue on the left hand side of the theatre, the kids called out for Santa who came out on a stage, then just sat down with the kids in their respective family groups on stage, had a brief chat with them, gave them a chocolate selection box and posed for a photo before being told to exit the other side of the stage. A couple of minutes at the most, pretty disappointing.
I have since found out from other people who went at the same time as us, that they all saw a Christmas show in the theatre or had a private Santa experience in his grotto so I'm baffled as to why we didn't receive either of those experiences.
We ate at Papa J's restaurant, it wasn't particularly busy and a few things were forgotten by the staff I.e. plates for the children despite asking for them twice so my partner and I ate our meals off the plates the starters came on. The food was absolutely delicious and fairly good value for money in comparison to some of the other places, I would definitely recommend eating here.
The swimming pool changing rooms were dirty, like really dirty and not necessarily from people using it that day but in desperate need of a deep clean. There were dirty nappies on the floor, bodily fluids including blood smears and bogeys on the walls and the floor was filthy.
I didn't see anyone cleaning in there at any stage, not even wiping the changing room floor which meant we had to put towels down in order to get changed and not get completely covered in dirt which meant our towels were so dirty we couldn't go swimming again during our stay.
We had forgotten the baby's swimming costume and had to look for a suitable suit, well there was only a pair of cheaply made trunks (nothing else in his size) and it cost us £10!!! I mean come on, his little swimsuit from Next didn't even cost that much, it really did take me aback but needs must. Well the trunks didn't fit him in the slightest they were massively too big and kept falling down, I feel that this aspect should be looked in to by Butlins as the trunks were incorrectly sized and extortionate, almost taking advantage of people who have no alternative.
During our time in the pool my partner took my little boy to the loo where a two young lads (one was a lifeguard and the other was dressed all in red) were having a loud conversation about one of the lads having an STI!!! Thankfully my little boy wasn't listening as we didn't fancy explaining to him what an STI was and it's a wholly inappropriate conversation to be having in a place mainly full of children.

I would class our very basic silver room as worth about £40 per night, but with the 3 day festival included £50 was fair.
The room was clean, bed & pillows very comfy, and there was a tv, kettle and large shower cubicle. It was very quiet & peaceful. Unfortunately the room had a damp, fishy whiff to it, only 2 plug sockets and no chair or dressing table. I just about managed to dry my hair standing up as my dryer has a long lead that reached the mirror. To be fair although the silver rooms are small & dated and lacking some things they are fine for a base to sleep & shower. The shower pressure was very poor....allow ten minutes extra for rinsing shampoo & conditioner off!
These rows of chalet type buildings are only 2 minutes walk from the main areas.
There is a good choice of food including burger king, pizza, pub grub & snacks at various locations. Various places to drink with a good selection of beers, wines and cocktails. The drinks prices do vary though according to which venue you are in. We had 2 fab dinners and an all day brunch at the Beachcomber inn. There really is something for everyone regarding dining & wining. There is 10 pin bowling, pool, snooker, mini golf and dozens of arcade games. We didnt use the pool & several of the shops were closed for winter. A spar shop, on site, supplies basics.
Staff everywhere were very friendly, polite & helpful....could not fault them. I was very impressed with the whole site & it exceeded my expectations. It seems like it would be a great summer holiday destination for kids. Fab layout, great signage and next to the beach. If we go again i think i would pay the extra for a hotel room though rather than a silver room.

No screaming kids in the tent. That’s what I like. Just loads of us grown ups having drinks and a laugh. I loved playing the games for tokens and I’m well chuffed with my minion although I’m sure I paid more than it’s worth!

This was all part of the Rockaway Beach festival and it was great. The two stages had good sound and seating for people like me who sometimes need a rest after dancing too much! Bar staff were super quick which really cut down waiting times and toilets aplenty so not too much queuing for those.

Only a ten minute walk from Bognor town centre it was nice to walk into town in the mornings and have a browse. Security staff were really friendly when letting us in/out.

Couple of downsides. (Sorry.) Not all the restaurants were open. So no diner for me. :( And also the cafe closed early Sunday night when all I wanted was a sarnie. (Sold out in shop too) so I kinda had to have chips. Also Burger King had really random opening hours. It closed at 4pm before re-opening really late when the music was on. I would have liked a burger at about 5-6pm.

The restaurants that were open were fantastic though. Papa Johns especially. Staff were mega friendly in there and the buffet was delicious! Chippy was good too apart from someone stealing my food when I wasn’t paying attention. (They made me another portion up though so it’s fine!)

Overall it was a great stay though and I’d definitely do it again.

I going to break down this review in to subsections as I feel it's the best way.

Resort and accommodation.

Like I said the resort seems much smaller than other Butlins, the lack of restaurants(I'll come back to Dining) are testament to that. It's a bit tired in places, but to be honest. I'd expect that and certianly would let that reflect badly on the place.
We booked a Seaside apartment, simply because it was the most expensive, so I assumed their best.
It's ok for three nights, but any more than that would be a struggle. They are very very small, much smaller than they look in the photos. The main bedroom, was a struggle to walk round when there was two of you in there. You had to close the bedroom door to open the wardrobe door. It all felt very clumsy and claustrophobic. We needed the kitchen as we have two kids under 4. Our friends stayed in the Hotel, and they sounded a much higher standard than our Seaside apartment. Talking of Seaside, they are no where near the seaside, they are shoved over the back of the resort, over looking a brick wall and the other side of that is a residential road in Bognor. Awful view.

Room cleaning

Is pretty much non existent. Honestly i mean terrible, they don't sweep the floors, they don't hoover. The never make all of the beds. Even after complaining on day two about failure to make the beds, they done exactly the same the next day. Guest services say the cleaners won't touch the beds if you leave stuff on them. So we made sure we didn't and they still never made all of the beds. One out of three on our last night.

Dining

Is very limited, if you don't have a dining package. We have booked the dining package on our two previous visits, but honestly the food is up to much and we wanted some higher quality food for the NYE break. Fast forward to NYE and we go out to eat about 7pm, only to find most of the restaurants have closed. Mental, the only option we had was the fish and chip restaurant and in fairness it was very nice. Seriously Butlins, people are on holiday you have to keep restaurants open later.
They are definitely at least two restaurants short at Bognor.
We ate in The Diner on the last night, we all wanted their ribs and were disappointed to find out that they'd run out and I quote a waitress ""we didn't restock as management wanted to get rid of everything in the fridge before they closed for 6 weeks"". Way to look after the customer Butlins! The food we had in there was average at best, burgers etc.

Entertainment

Is superb, it's by far there best thing about Butlins. From the Cinderella Rocks show which is absolutely brilliant to the tribute acts - we saw Elton John, Freddie Mercury and The Ratpack. All very very good and the kids and adults loved the Animal Antics show, its great.

Splash Waterworld

Is tired and pretty poor, but theres a new pool opening in 2019. So it looks like they've addressed that.

Other guests

Here i might lose some of you, but the main problem with Butlins is the other guests. It's like The Jeremy Kyle Show on steroids, honestly it's god awful. Don't get me wrong, I grew up coming to Butlins and this was my third visit this year, I grew up on a council estate, so I'm no snob. But Butlins hosts the lowest common denominator of the human race. Like a Sports Direct catwalk show and rude with it. They also constantly flout the very strict smoking policy that Butlins have in place to protect out little ones lungs. There are clearly marked smoking areas, yet guests just smoked where they wanted. Outside the fish and chip shop was the worse, hundreds of cigarette butts stubbed out on tables in a NO SMOKING ZONE. Butlins do absolutely nothing to police it either.

Summary

Would I go again, probably as the kids love it. But only in a large group so you can lose yourself in each others company.I'd also only stay in the hotels.

To start reception it was busy as there were several Xmas parties that evening. However, the reception team were quick and efficient.

The old building was OK, a little bit cha by in places. Looked lovely with decorations up. The room was OK. A little small compared to our friends. I believe we all paid the same price. However I guess just pot luck there.

Bed was comfortable, nice amenities as expected.

Christmas party itself. Room was good, plenty of space on the table. We had 3 course meal. The food tasted fine, a little dissapointed with the main. Roast turkey was lacking more on the plate. 3 sprouts, 3 potatoes a small amount of mixed veg, now for a Xmas dinner I expect more tbh.

The live band were fantastic, played a great mix of all genres the dance floor was packed most of the night. I believed they were called the delorians.

After the party, about 1:20 in the morning the fire alarm was set off. It took a while for any staff to communicate what was happening. I appreciate the time and staff numbers at that moment but we were stood outside in the rain.

Ok, the good, it’s got Hilton beds and bedding in the room, my room was enormous, good quality large flat screen TV, the bathroom is decent and clean, the staff were all faultless, friendly, helpful, etc. the pool is good and the changing rooms are pretty modern, the gym could do with being larger mind you. Breakfast good quality and service.

The bad, I think most reviews touch on that it just needs a really good refurbishment, the carpets are appalling - pretty much everywhere, the bedroom furniture is pretty run down. The info book in the room says that breakfast starts at 0700 which was not ideal for me as I needed to get to a meeting, however I went down at 0650 and it was open, apparently it opens at 0630. The pool doesn’t not open till 0700 which was useless for me as I could not use before work.

The room service menu is very limited and just burgers, fish and chips, etc, not much healthy options.

I’m sure it would feel different during the summer, but in midwinter it’s pretty grim, it just is not Hilton quality which is a pity.

For a start if you look at the photographs of the double rooms you will see that the same photograph is used for different types of double rooms but the daily price is different. We could find nowhere on the site that informed guests that there was no lift. When we booked in we asked for a room with a stand in shower (we should have asked for a walking one) as my partner has arthritis and has difficulty in bending we were shown a room on the fourth floor, up four flights of stairs. The room had a shower over the bath which was unsuitable for us. We asked for a room on a lower floor with a walking shower but all showers are over the bath. The rooms are rather dated and not suitable at all for people with any form of disability. We decided not to stay, which was a pity, the Hotel should make very clear that there is no lift and are not really suited to people who are even slightly disabled.

The restaurant staff were very helpful with our decorations and, as there were 16 of us, asked us to pre-order dinner which worked well. Dinner was delicious as was breakfast with a good variety on offer.
The boys all played golf which they enjoyed, and the rest of us used the leisure facilities which were clean.
This hotel is not ideal if you are at all immobile as there are lots of stairs (apart from the main ones): down to the bar, down more to the lounge, and up to the restaurant, but no lifts. Mum struggled but we coped. We were also told that their shower would be walk-in but it was over the bath. Again, not ideal but we coped.

The hotel is near to Arundel and has extensive grounds.

Our room was well equipped but had an extremely noisy creaky floor!

We had several meals during our stay. There was a good selection of typical hot and cold options for breakfast.

However both our evening meals were unacceptable, and lacking In flavour, with over cooked or under cooked elements and the service was extremely slow.

Friday’s buffet was absolutely awful, watery bland ‘curry’, pasta, ‘stroganoff’ and the most basic of salad options and deserts.

Last night’s dinner service took over 3 hours as there were very long waits in between courses so we finished at 2240!! This meant that we lost an hour of our entertainment leaving guests disappointed!

The hotel doesn’t have any lifts which made it difficult with our luggage as we were on the second floor with a lengthy walk to our room (far from ideal for anyone elderly or with health issues).

Several areas are looking rather shabby with maintenance needed, new carpet, paint etc.

The staff were very polite and helpful throughout our stay but clearly just could not cope - there just weren’t enough on duty.

Actually, we were given a really good king suite which has recently been redecorated overlooking the front of the hotel. It was very hot weather and this was a blessing as the room stayed in the shade and stayed cool. We also had fans as there was no air con. The out door and indoor pools were fabulous and we really enjoyed the hotel grounds. Staff in the leisure suite were great, courteous and safety conscious with the kids in the pool.The golf course looked very good. The only real disappointment was dinner. The restaurant lacked atmosphere, service was appallingly slow and food portions very small for the price. I’m never a big fan of hotel restaurants but this really was not great. Staff were polite and tried their best but I felt there was probably not enough of them and some were clearly very inexperienced.
Next day, breakfast was great but there was only one poor guy on the bar trying to serve coffee / drinks for many guests sitting inside and out and around the pool area. We did enjoy our stay and reception gave me drinks vouchers when I complained about dinner service, which was unacceptable for a Hilton and the price.

The reception couldn’t find our booking so was asked to take a seat. There was cobwebs over the lighting, so first impressions were not good. As we waited more than 40 minutes the room the amount of people complaining was astounding. Keys didn’t work, windows stuck, rooms too hot. One member of staff Esme was bossing the trainee around as she was trying to deal with us, instead of going around the reception desk herself. Also leaning over the desk, as she once again couldn’t be bothered to walk around it so I got an eyeful of her underwear as her dress was so short. Then proceeded to to hum to herself while everyone stood around annoyed.

The room was far from deluxe, basic and in need of some attention. The window wouldn’t stay open as the frame was rotten and there was a window pane missing which was covered up with plastic and cellotape. No air con so the room was scorching. They provided a huge extremely noisy fan which just blew warm air around as the window wouldn’t stay open. Just awful.

The lounge area had several lightbulbs out but was nice to sit in. The garden was lovely for eventing drinks.

The restaurant is our favourite part of this hotel. The food was lovely and the restaurant staff were well trained. Although service was a little slow but as it’s so lovely in the we didn’t mind waiting.

So that will be our final visit to this hotel. As there are our superior to this for the same money.

The bed was really quite hard however the staff were happy to place a mattress topper which they did and that did make a difference.

The pool is small, the facilities non existent, the relax room not really relaxing, just a sitting room with 4 loungers, only herbal tea - not “allowed” coffee or milk. As both spa members informed us and questioned guests as to what member actually bought the milk in when it not allowed - really should guest be hearing this?
No dressing gowns or slippers available, not for discount guests anyway.
Had a lovely massage and facial but the time 25 min each was slightly shorter, about 45 mins for both. Must be because we were discount again. Definitely made to feel they were doing us a favour.
However the staff in the bar and restaurant were lovely, very good service. Lovely 2 course meal, have to buy drinks as this is not included, but that was expected.
Won’t go again, not even with discount voucher would rather save up and pay more (real price) but to a different spa, there’s a lot of competition near.
The voucher might get people in but I doubt there’s much repeat business, which is a shame. But really need to invest a bit into the place, and train some staff to make guest feel special if in the hospitality business.

246,1008,628,Arundel,1,"Lovely Location - Tatty Hotel Where to begin – this is definitely not the standard of hotel synonymous with the Hilton Brand, in my opinion it is the worst Hilton I have stayed in to date! The hotel is in desperate need of a major refurb, the creaking floorboards threadbare carpets and scruffy walls in the corridors are very off putting. The building itself is charming and with some serious investment it could be a lovely venue. Our room had recently been painted and although small was generally clean – I did, however make the mistake of looking out of the window to find that the windowsill was filthy and covered in dust & cobwebs – which was a shame as the rest of the room was fine. There are also no lifts available so if you have mobility issues be sure to request a room on the ground floor. There was no air-con in our room, although there was a very noisy metal fan supplied, so it was a toss up as to whether the heat or the noise kept you awake at night. The reception staff on check in were very helpful and efficient – not so good on check-out (different staff) who seemed to be struggling with the busy period. We also found the bar staff to be very helpful and friendly – but the drinks are over priced – £12.50 for a large glass of Sauvignon Blanc! The biggest shambles was definitely breakfast time – we headed down at 08.45 and there was a very long queue, we were eventually seated at a table – only to be moved on by a very angry customer when he returned from fetching his breakfast a few minutes later – so back to the desk to wait for another available table, without so much as an apology from the lady who sat us down in the first place! It was a very hit and miss affair with some tables being offered teas & coffees and others being left to fend for themselves. Admittedly it was a very busy breakfast session, but the wait for certain hot items (eggs/bacon/sausages) was ridiculously long, the remaining items were congealing on your plate before the stocks were replenished, and when I asked a member of staff how much longer the wait would be, I was informed by her that it wasn’t her department so I would just have to wait as one of her colleagues would deal with it! After a wait of over 45 minutes (from initially queuing) we decided that enough was enough, and left without bothering. We would have complained there and then but couldn't find anyone to complain to - and after the attitude of the member of staff we did talk to anout the food issues, we thought we'd be wasting our breath anyway. This Hilton was terrible value for money, and to be honest I have stayed in better budget hotels, definitely one I will avoid in future!

The hotel needs a major overhaul, the paintwork, decoration and carpets in most areas is apalling. The creakibg floor boards in the corridors were awful, how the people staying in those rooms got any rest is beyond me!

This might be an old hotel, but it more than makes up for it with it's wonderful peaceful location and charm.
This time it was an Abba tribute night including overnight stay, once again for a great price and the entertainment was once again absolutely brilliant as was the atmosphere.
Once again the three course meal apart from being perfect plus very tasty, the staff work well as a team making sure all guests are served promptly and ensure the service they receive is faultless making the whole evening a wonderful experience.
I will definitely be booking to stay and watch future tribute nights, which I cannot recommend highly enough.
The breakfast was also up to the standard we have come to expect from Hilton, with lots of choice and although the hotel was obviously busy staff were very efficient at clearing tables so reducing having to queue to be seated.
We will not hesitate to return sometime in the future, especially for future great value tribute nights.

254,1059,672,Arundel,4,"Fine stay in a historic atmosphere The Hilton Avisford Park in Arundel is not your typical Hilton property. It was initially opened in 1756 and is on 89 acres and has a golf course right next to it. This is a great location for a visit to Arundel Castle and other historic places or a round of golf. We are here the night before a cruise out of Portsmouth so great location for lots of things. The night we were here there were two weddings being hosted so lots of folks having a great time. There is a magnificent patio out back for enjoying the sun and a drink and watching the younger crowd enjoy ping pong and other games. Lots of fun for sure. I’d give it 5 stars for sure because I emailed and asked to be on the first floor since there wasn’t a lift and I was quickly emailed back saying it’s all handled and they’d be glad to help with luggage too! Great customer service! There was a few mis-steps that I’ll only mention because it helps management see where a tad bit more training might be in order, but this to me is small stuff because the room was quaint and cool and the staff super nice and attentive just the way Hilton properties tend to be. So our room didn’t have a bar of soap and no liquid body soap yet two bottles of conditioner so I think one was supposed to be liquid body soap and the lack of a bar of soap I’m sure was an oversight. Luckily we brought our own. The light bulb is burned out next to the bed closest to the bathroom in room 041 so quite dark in that corner. Also as Diamonds we received two certificates for a free drink so my wife and I ordered a glass of wine each at dinner and we were billed for one of them. So all of these items are small mis-steps and I know I could have said something but not a big deal for me. I suspect hosting two weddings and managing the rest of the hotel guests is not easy. Again no big deal and I know it would have been instantly remedied. On another note the dinner in the restaurant was fabulous. My lamb dinner was just perfect and the staff was very friendly and fun. So a 4 star experience in a 5 star fun and quaint experience. I’d stay here again in a heartbeat and recommend you give it a try!

On arrival the outside looks run down but we’re open minded as to the interior. Staff on arrival were friendly and check in process was smooth and quick.

However on arriving at our room all of this went quickly downhill! I cannot even express our disgust at the standard of the room at a Hilton property. Scuffed and peeling wallpaper and skirting boards, broken tiles in the bathroom, windows that were black in the wood. But worst of all of this was the huge patches of damp and water that was coming through the walls. My child suffers from asthma and there was no way we were staying in that room - it was a health hazard and completely unacceptable for any standards let alone a Hilton suite!

On returning to reception the staff were very good and moved us into another room which was of a better standard. However can’t help wondering why we weren’t put into this room in the beginning rather than the disgusting original room as it was empty?!

Just to note the new room wasn’t perfect either and was lacking a chain that actually flushed in the toilet with ease (you had to push the button with two hands and a lot of strength to get it to work!) but was better.

Cannot comment on other facilities as chose to eat out and spend the least amount of time possible at this place, but I can say the original room we were put in was a total rip off and wouldn’t have stayed there at £50 let alone £200! Again reiterate staff were helpful.

We arrived early, we were able to store our bags until the room was ready. We had been upgraded from a twin room to a twin deluxe. The room was very spacious, beds were so comfortable. The reason for our visit was the Groupon spa package which included lunch, 2 treatments each and the use of the relaxation room, gym, pool, sauna and steam room. My mum chose a neck, shoulder and back massage and a facial and I opted for the neck, shoulder and back massage and a manicure. The beauty team; Hollie and Hannah were absolutely fantastic and the treatments we received were excellent. The livingwell facilities were good, the only fault was that there wasn’t enough beds for the amount of people, this was due to people leaving bags and clothes on beds when not using them, which is particularly selfish seeing as everyone is given a locker key. Maybe a notice asking people to use the lockers rather than reserving beds would help.

Within the price of our hotel room was a 3 course dinner and breakfast. The dinner was amazing and staff were very attentive. Every lady was given a complimentary glass of Prosecco for International Woman’s Day, which was a lovely touch. The breakfast was a buffet, so much choice and all piping hot. The pancakes were delicious.

All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely visit again in the future.

I was traveling from wales for a family funeral and asked if I could check in early. I didn’t hear anything back until 24 hrs later saying I could but at an extra cost of £20.

I declined this and said I would review this service once I return home from my trip.

The room I stayed in was room 11. This was at the top of the hotel in what felt like the furthest corner. The hotel had a funny smell which wasn’t very pleasant.

The room was ok but you could tell that it needed some work with it- bath had a hole in that looked like it was filled in with some putty. The paint was knocked and chipped away. I was rather disappointed and felt I would’ve been better off at a local travel lodge.

The hotel was dead and it felt like I was the only person in it- no offer for upgrade like most hotels would offer. I felt like the hotel cared more about the money than customer service and experience.

The food did smell nice but due to poor experience from start I ended up going to local competition which I was glad of.

I spoke to family who live in area and they laughed at me when I said I was staying in this hotel- they advised its been going backwards in recent years.

On entry into the hotel Reception area there was a distinct bad smell of sewerage or something similar.
At 3pm we checked in and was given Bedroom 18 which is up 3 flights of stairs up on the top floor. On entry into our bedroom there was a nice 4 poster bed with plenty of space in the bedroom area. However all we could hear were the pidgeon above us in the loft cooing constantly. We thought that at least come night time they would fly off and not disturb us.....wrong they obviously have nested in the loft as they could be heard walking across the ceiling and cooing once again throughout the night. On check out the next morning i reported it to the Receptionist who didn't seem particularly concerned and just said 'I know'....somewhat disappointing.

We attended the Jersey Boys Event which was great although the dining tables were so packed in that it was difficult to get out from your chair and go to the in-room bar for drinks or the loo without disturbing others on different tables who in turn had to get up to allow you through.

After the Jersey boys Event had finished we retired to the hotel bar for a nightcap....the barman didn't have 2 of the 4 drinks I ordered...things like Port and when asked for a Bloody Mary hadn't a clue what it was..

On Check out we fouind that we had been overcharged by £10 so showed the Receptionist our confirmation email from the hotel and refunded us the £10...again disappointed that we had to raise it.

All in all we left with negative thoughts about the place rather than positive ones...having said that I would recommend it to others for its location and potential but on this occassion we felt the attention to detail was sadly lacking.

Employees were seated on the ground, smoking in the car park and dirty laundry was left in a pile by the exit for quite some time.

The back of my bathroom door was heavily spattered with someone else's toothpaste or soap remains, which was an unpleasant surprise although the high quality bath gel and shampoo were welcome. The bathmat had a large hole in it although all linen was clean.

This wonderful, old building could, with a little TLC, a good, deep clean and some attention to interior design, be a really nice boutique-type hotel. Instead it's tired, shoddy and seems unloved. A real pity. Such potential!

Simon the hotel director was on hand through the whole event to ensure everything was going to plan and no issue and everyone was happy.

Menus were delivered quickly and we decided to go for a selection of the light bite dishes.
Within minutes of our order being taken we were delivered some really tasty food.
Tender pork marinated in a zingy Malaysian style sauce, fish goujons with tarter sauce and mushy pea dips, prawns with marie rose sauce and chicken satay skewers with two dips. As is customery when my family dine out we also had a bowl of triple cooked chips.
It was meat to be a light lunch, but there was a serious amount of food as you can see by the pictures and it was simply delicious.
We all had our favouites but for me the chicken skewers were fantastic. The chicken was lovely and moist and the sauces superb.
Everything was hot and well presented in different dishes.
Looking at the menu there was so much more we could have had and we'll certainly be back to try some of the other dishes on there.
Might even try the hotel soon for an evening meal if that is the standard of the food.

We will definitely stay there on our next visit . Take no notice of the moaners.

281,1196,782,Arundel,4,"Friendly staff, clean rooms, breakfast needs some work The Norfolk Arms is perfectly situated within reach of just about everything in Arundel. The staff there couldn't be more friendly, welcoming and accommodating. My room, a single, was clean and well appointed, although the pillows were rather uncomfortable - one was very thin and they were both a bit hard. A fan had thoughtfully been provided to deal with the extremely hot weather. The problem with the breakfast was that the ""vegetarian sausage"" was in fact a roll of mashed potato and carrot pieces, rather than a Quorn or soya or even seitan substitute. As the vegetarian breakfast came with hash browns but only one poached egg, this made it very potato-heavy and protein-light. (The standard ""full English"" has both sausages and bacon.) The young serving staff at breakfast were very pleasant and helpful.

Unfortunately, our room was disappointing. The curtains could not be drawn, many hooks missing and looked very old, tired and shabby. The décor again needed a freshen up as could the bathroom. Although the tiles had been painted, some guests had seen fit to scratch into them. The bath grouting too could do with attention. The courtesy tea/coffee tray could have been a little more generous with the number of tea bags/coffee given. We had a great weekend with excellent company, and the hotel was the only disappointment.

The room was suitable for purpose in a back courtyard that was quite and unobtrusive. The most disappointing thing about our stay was the disgusting and virtually inedible breakfast. The cold buffet was mediocre (dried up cheese, ham with dried edges- looked a day old) in comparison to other hotels I’ve stayed in, I asked for a hot chocolate and was told no only tea or coffee, so asked for a flat white and was told no that wasn’t possible so decided on tea which was obviously what they wanted me to have! Anyway let me really tell you about the so say Norfolk Arms Full English breakfast. One shrivelled tomato that was so dried up it was like a rock, a hash brown so deep fried the grease was oozing out, a piece of bacon that was dried up and burnt, inedible scrambled egg that was more like dried shoe leather in a flat thin section, a cold piece of black pudding, cold beans and mushrooms that had the most dreadful flavour of as I’d imagine old socks.. the only good thing was the one tiny little sausage that was probably a local specialty.. I wish I’d just had sausages!! I can honestly say if this place had a decent chef you would not have to go elsewhere, but if you can avoid breakfast do as there are loads of other places in the town that you can eat at!

We found the Hotel car park at the rear of the hotel, but after entering through a barrier, I went to get a permit to park the car and was told we would have to pay £10 to park, as we were not staying at the hotel(WHY) the car park was empty!!! Bearing in mind we were about to spend over £100 for lunch. We then left and parked in the road free.
We then went back in to get a coffee while waiting for our friends. The barman looked like we had asked for something unusual ( 2 Americanos), he went across the courtyard as that was where the coffee machine was!
Our friends arrived and the waiter was hovering waiting for us to take our place at our table, this was now about 1pm, the restaurant was completely empty! We were surprised as it was Sunday lunch. We were then told that some of the choices on the menu were not available, the roast only included chicken or Pork Belly(not what you would expect on a Sunday no Roast Beef!). However the food was ok really nothing that exceptional.
Where were all the people, very soulless, heated by a fan heater although they did have an open fire! After time a couple came in for lunch and another for a cream tea.
We left quite disappointed and will not return. We have been to some really superb restaurants in the area nothing like this.

291,1263,845,Arundel,1,"Rude staff! This is is a hotel which can’t train their staff and when a problem occurs because of it, they blame it on the customers with aggressive rudeness and make them feel really, really awful. Totally ruined our weekend in Arundel.
This is what they did to us...
- I booked this hotel as it came up top of the search with Pets Allowed filter in TripAdvisor. The website for booking was a different agent which was still ‘Pets Allowed” (to make my point).
- On arrival, we were greeted by a friendly receptionist and 2 other staff. They saw us with our dog and they even petted him etc. The receptionist even told us ‘Your room is one of the 3 dog-friendly rooms which is outside.” She even showed us a room where we can have our breakfast with our dog. So they knew we had a dog right from the beginning and gave us the room.
- Next day, at the check-out, a different woman was at the reception. She attacked us by rudely saying “Why didn’t you tell us you had a dog? Your room isn’t a dog-friendly room and it’ll cost us a lot of money for cleaning. You should have told us in advance about your dog like most people!”. We were absolutely stunned by the rudeness and the lack of customer service! She really REALLY made us furious.
- Why was it OUR fault when we were given that room? We had a dog with us right from the beginning, it’s not as if we smuggled the dog into the room! She wouldn’t back off! They charged extra £10 for the dog anyway (which we never complained about), so what was she trying to achieve by upsetting us like that? Unbelievable.
What kind of hotel is that? This woman has zero customer service, and because of that, we would never stay there again.

292,1270,852,Arundel,3,"Mixed feelings I only stayed at this hotel for one night whist visiting friends in the area, Our room was overlooking the high street and I was concerned it was going to be noisy but to be fair it was fine.
Location - In Arundel high street, with all the sights of the town within easy walking distance.
Appearance - Old historic building probably needs a coat of paint here and there but generally in a good condition.
Staff Service - Average , we only met the reception lady and the server at breakfast, the latter was good and had no issues granting us a second pot of tea, but I was annoyed with the former who did not tell me the car park was £5 a night until I checked out. I know its not a huge sum of money but it is the principle of the matter.I do not like hidden charges.
Room - A decent size, , comfortable bed, with iron, and ironing board a good sized flat screen Tv but no safe. Tea/coffee and biscuits and a kettle are provided.

Bathroom - Again a decent size with quality toiletries provided. Our room had a rainfall shower over the bath ( I hate rainfall showers but that's just me) with plenty of hot water available.
WIFI - Free and a good signal throughout the hote
Breakfast - A cooked breakfast is available and cooked to order along with usual continental offerings such as toast, yogurts, cereals, croissants and buns etc. The full English breakfast does give you all the components one would expect but is not overly generous with one sausage, one rasher of bacon and a teaspoonful of beans, but it did taste nice.

Would I stay here again, probably not, for a £100 a night for B&B and then charge customers for using the hotel car park sticks in my throat a bit so I will probably shop around when I am next staying in the area.

However, was very impressed at the Shoreline Hotel. We had opted for a separate children’s bedroom and partial sea view. We could park very close to the hotel, check in was relatively quick and our daughter loved the octopus floor cushion and activity board on the wall. The room felt spacious, our daughters room had bunk beds and we managed to fit a travel cot next to them and there was plenty of space near the door for our pram. The location is excellent, right next to the fairground, the swimming pool and the skyline pavilion.

Just for info, the children’s bedroom is closed off with (themed) blackout curtains, not a door. We chose not to watch tv in the evening because of this we didn’t want the noise to wake our daughter.

Only a few negative points: the free WiFi lasts no time at all, there are no plug sockets near the bed and breakfast is quite pricey for adults if you’re not on a dining plan (£11.95 each)

I would definitely recommend this hotel, it really contributed to us having a great trip (plus there was a character in the lobby when we arrived, great touch!)

The hotel was clean and lively. We really enjoyed the fun themed rooms for the children.

We opted for restaurant passes and enjoyed visiting the restaurant for breakfast and dinner each day. There was a wide variety of food all of which was delicious. The desserts were the highlight for me!

The park itself was well maintained and with a happy feel. Staff were friendly and helpful. As we visited during the Christmas period the park gave a off a festive feel, the lit up trees look wonderful at night. The pantomimes were brilliant, my wife particularly enjoyed the shows.

Some activities are free which you have to book for and others additional charges apply. The swimming pool offered a disco themed evening which was most enjoyed by both grandchildren. I believe a new Poole is coming for 2019.

Overall very much enjoyed and would look to return. The hotel gets a 5 star from me!

Booking nearly didn't happen as I had an issue with not getting through on the phone system, sending me in a circle. A few calls back and forth between myself and Manu I was told the quote I had saved had expired. Manu could sense I wasn't satisfied so promised to call me back if anything changes and once he had spoke to a manager. He came back to me and once I had proved (via screenshot) that I had called and how long I was on the phone for they honoured the original quote.
We arrived on resort just after 1pm and was able to check in straight away to our room in the Shoreline. First time booking a hotel room at Bognor- and I was not disappointed.
We had opted for the Dine around package as we wanted to eat in the Deck and the diner. My daughter has a severe allergy to wheat/gluten so we were very apprehensive about this. On our first evening we went into the Deck and was greeted by Anca. I explained the allergy my 5 year old has and she explained what food she could have cooked fresh for her and that she would see us at breakfast and arrange a freshly cooked gluten free breakfast for her. Every single meal provided for her was cooked freshly and separately including her breakfast which we were so grateful for. Thank you Anca for putting our mind at rest and arranging this. We also went to the Diner and Chloe served us, again with the same care and double checking the allergen information.
We really enjoyed the Dine around, you get given a drink voucher in the evening for 1 alcoholic drink of carling or house wine - it would have been nice to have the option of draught soft drink coke/sprite for all venues (we only experienced having this in the Diner)
The new pool gets a 4 out of 5* from us. The one thing that let it down was there was no where suitable for my daughter to swim comfortably. She is taking lessons, so swims with a float, but likes to be able to touch the floor. One pool was 1.2m too deep for her. The only other pool was the wave pool, which she had to get out every 15 or so mins when the wave machine came on. It's great for slides and rides, but if you've got a small person who wants to swim rather than splash about then be prepared to hop in and out if the wave pool. It was great that the hotels had access between 8am and 9am to get in early to experience the new pool.
We really had value for money, we booked the character Breakfast, Easter bonnet craft session, completed the Easter egg hunt and collected a chocolate egg with egg cup, put Billy Bear to bed. My daughter coloured in a picture for Billy and put in the post box in the hotel. The next morning, a letter from Billy was posted under the door. Well done to the team for dechipering her writing and locating her as she'd only put her name and surname. It made her day!
Shows were great, tots fairground and fun fair also great.
Shoreline was in a brilliant location and close to everything and was such a fantastic hotel.
Every staff member interacted with my daughter and made us feel like an individual family.
Housekeeping came each day with different animal towels and moved soft toys around to make my daughter laugh.
All in all a fantastic, value for money break. After a bad experience at Bognor in gold accommodation a few years ago we have avoided it and gone to Minehead instead. I'm so glad we gave it another chance with the hotel and dining. Thank you all at Bognor Butlins - we will be back!

We spent a long weekend there with our 3-yr old and by far this is one of the best hotels we’ve stayed in as a family. I travel all over the world for work so my expectations are high, however for family travel this ticks all the boxes.

There is a little TV area by reception showing CBeebies which is a great distraction on check-In.

The ‘ship’ theme is subtle yet consistent throughout the hotel which makes it fun for little ones.

Our room had a separate sleeping den for children (bliss!) and it’s own tv. Additional touches such as the nightlight and mini wardrobe were appreciated.

The bathroom is functional, do take own toiletries as you are not supplied with any more then the mini bottles which last a day.

The is a step & little toilet seat for children which is a nice touch.

Lots of storage, fridge, kettle etc. A separate sofa area and an activity wall which my daughter loved

Breakfast is very good, lots of choices and well managed by the restaurant team.

For all the inconvenience of having to sit and wait(last thing I wanted to do celebrating my partners romantic birthday getaway), we were not offered anything to drink at all.
Eventually they came into the waiting area with a form and checked us in in the waiting area with other guests around, a bit unceremonious I thought.

was looking forward to a sauna and plunge in pool but wasn't to be.
Apparently sauna had a fire days before, so they already knew about it and didn't pre-warn me or even consider some compensatory measure.
Once again for this inconvenience, there was nothing offered to compensate.

308,1337,908,Littlehampton,5,"Autumn Fireside Bliss This is our second trip to Bailiffscourt Hotel and Spa. It was a mother/adult daughter getaway over two nights. We had a lovely room, Kynsdene, with two twin beds on the ground floor of a lovely thatched roof building just a few steps from the main reception/dining location. What we had problems with was the spa. Though our treatments were very good, we found mold growing on wood plank trim near the shower, and thought the locker room very down scale. A single hand towel hung in the very small toilet room for all to dry their hands on. Yuck. There literally is no where to relax and luxuriate (the latter being the key word) before your treatment. Your choices are: 1. Poolside. There are two pool areas,one a covered and chlorine smelling indoor area, and one out of doors, which was very cold, rainy and windy during our stay. I had wanted to enjoy the whirlpool spa before my treatment. With the indoor pool one closed, I tried the one outside but found it lukewarm and the jets not adequate to produce a true whirlpool experience. 2. Upstairs in what can best be described as a rumpus room. Big, warn couches of many styles and upholstery sit among a large flat screen tv and coffee machine. What???? 3. Downstairs in the cavernous reception area with two large, but nice and modern couches. And after your treatment, should you want to continue your relaxed state, there are those areas plus another. It is the smallest relaxation room I have ever encountered with 5 or so loungers that look as though they should be on the beach, they are so low to the ground. They are packed into such a small space it is ludicrous. These situations are not befitting a top tier establishment that Bailiffscourt claims to be.

The hotel is arranged in different buildings. Previously I stayed in the thatched house which is connected by underground tunnel to the reception building. Beautiful ground floor medieval feeling cosy rooms. This time I stayed in a Climping Original room in the gate house on the first floor; a rustic on the outside but tastefully decorated, spacious inside with roll top bath.

Both rooms were relaxing luxury with comfortable double beds and a choise of pillows. Tea making facilities in room. Furniture is either antique or tasteful reproduction.

The history of the hotel tells you although it looks medieval it was actually built using reclaimed materials and even entire buildings circa 1930...when to do this was unusual.

The breakfast was a bountiful buffet plus cooked breakfast. The even meal was great although rather expensive if not on a deal.

Not an inexpensive place but worth a visit to stay over or as a day spa visitor for a treat or special celebration.

We got a deal for staying 2 nights with dinner and had a thoroughly lovely time. The hotel is quirky, and upon reading the history of the hotel it makes sense. Lovely grounds, and very very friendly and attentive staff.
The food was delicious. I'm lactose intolerant and the staff were understanding and attentive to this. Additionally, the chef amended some of the dishes for me - proving that the food is fresh and made from scratch.
My highlight though, was the spa. My partner and I spent most of our time between the pool and the sun loungers. We tried all the facilities and had a massage (which was amazing!). I fell in love with the products they use, was given some lovely samples and am now a customer of TempleSpa products! I was impressed with the temperature of the shower pre/post sauna (cold but not too cold!), the abundance of available towels, helpful staff, testers and products every where to aid the experience etc etc. So many little details to make if feel luxurious.
Whilst there, I happen to overhear another customer complain to the Spa Manger that they didn't like the redecoration (it hadn't been completed) and general grumbling. I felt the complaints were totally unjust; but I was impressed with the polite, emphatic. and dignified way the Manager handled this customer stating that it was all work in progress and that they had all been working hard on the revamp. I can only imagine the long hours that go into a revamp of a spa.
Well done guys, looking forward to coming back soon.

It is a bit of a rabbit warren to find your way around but that comes with its historic origins. The biggest fault is the service at the restaurant. It is like visiting a service training school where the students are having their first go. The head waiter, if that is what he was, was always hurried. None of them seemed to have much idea how to talk to customers. They need more and better trained front-of-house staff. The food itself was good.

Starters ? Opted for scallops. We expected, given the £ supplement, to receive 2 maybe 3 King Scallops. We were given what appeared to be 4 Queenie's, just the width of a10p piece max, BUT CUT IN HALF through their girth to a max thickness of 2 £1 coins stacked, presented as 8 pieces,seared side up ????

Mains? I opted for herb crusted cod fillet, again, mean-spirited portion. Tad wider than a fish finger, tasty yes but again tiny .The penultimate negative? Hubby ordered "" Cake "" A Fish Cake of sorts, on a ""Lobster Cream"" and a ""poached egg"" on top,which,as eggs go, had the unyielding stance of a cold squash ball and needed pinning before carving. Given the the slow service, it had been sitting on the pass for too long and is why the lobster cream dissipated.

Final negative? A bill for £100 excluding service with just one small glass of average wine.

Upon complaint..Charlie, a fine ambassador for the BCH simply advised us that our remarks would be forwarded to the chef. By then a tad too late, day already spoilt. Given BCH knew at the time of booking it that it was an important event, I am just so sorry they failed to live up to their own reputation. Most importantly it made our own celebration day way below average. Let's hope it was a just bad day but struggle to justify going back to,or recommend it to others

The reception team were warm and friendly and went out of their way to help us settle in. They had recommended a particular room to suit our requirements and it was lovely and suited us perfectly. Bailiffscourt is in a beautiful setting, very peaceful, and we were able to totally relax, after a hectic few days, which was the aim of our stay. The food was wonderful: inventive (but not wacky!) and delicious and a feast for the eyes too. But it’s the little things that make the difference in a top class place like Bailiffscourt: the manager stopping to chat to see if you’re enjoying yourselves, the genuine caring kindness (rather than someone just following customer service rules) of staff like Arthur who served us in the lounge, the gorgeous and plentiful spa products in the bathroom. It’s fair to say that it’s expensive to stay there, so, for us, although we’d love to go back, we will have to wait for another special occasion. However, the whole visit felt like a wonderful treat from start to finish and I can’t recommend it highly enough.

The location was second to none - being a short walk to Climping beach from the grounds, which were extensive and laid out with flowers, lawns as well as a wooded area.

The facilities were very good. The spa building was sublime with the indoor pool and spa itself. The icing on the cake was the amazing heated outdoor infinity pool and hot tub. We were lucky enough to stay during some warm weather and used the sunbeds and hammocks there. It was so peaceful and relaxing.

The food is of a very high standard. The wood panelled restaurant was in a historic building with tapestries on the walls. The staff were so professional and friendly.

All in all the hotel was the best we have ever stayed in and made our 35th wedding anniversary memorable.

Only a couple of tiny gripes... some of the staff aren’t as “present” as they should be and sometimes we had to wait a while for a waiter or go and find one to order a cup of tea or coffee.

This hotel is one of the most beautiful places and settings on God's earth, and the welcome we received and the service throughout the evening was at the top end of excellent.

The food was very good. The wine list is one of the best I have seen in a while. This is a pricey place to visit, but not extortionate for a special occasion. We were very content.

If I was being picky - and at these prices, perhaps I should - the food was very good, rather than outstanding, when compared with the better restaurants we have visited in France in recent years. For example, my grilled sea bass was a little overdone and not as waxy as I would have expected, and generally the beautifully presented and delicious food lacked the last degree of inspiration one sometimes finds. That said, this is England, and I cannot recall a better meal in the UK in a long time.

As noted, and it is right to repeat, the service was really outstanding and the friendly comfortable atmosphere created by the staff permeates the whole place. Our desert plates were inscribed ""happy anniversary"" in chocolate, which was a lovely touch. We walked through the beautiful grounds to the beach after supper and watched the sun set. Oh, I didn't mention the dessert. I had a rhubarb and chocolate tart. That really was special!

319,1374,949,Littlehampton,4,"Five star official food hygiene rating.Friendly and helpful staff but only a one star beach What a pleasant unexpected upgrade from Bailiffscourt!

We had opted for a light updated room that was unfortunately out of service.

It was almost a second honeymoon to be given the quiet spacious Sowthewode room with a four poster bed and several windows with a sea view! It is great family accommodation as the lounge area with chairs and dining table has a sofa bed too.

In contrast to medieval or traditional furnishing and fitting a modern large screen television set could be swivelled and viewed from either the lounge area or the four poster bed.

In addition to the sea view our room also overlooked a walled garden area and the helicopter landing area.

A great feature of the four poster bed was that it also had well orientated spotlights to enable easy and pleasant reading.

The room would be challenging to an antique specialist to identify genuine medieval building recycled materials from excellent reproductions produced in the 1920s for the property when new.

What a magnificent setting was provided in the Tapestry Restaurant for our first evening meal.

Thick candles on each table flickered to light up silver display dishes and silver table ware and gave warm lighting to the medieval setting . A magnificent group of real white orchids added the final touches

The restaurant cellar includes many fine wines that are promoted to accompany specific deserts. Our daughter tells us we are behind the times if we consider £8 for a glass of wine to be expensive!

Superb freshly baked rolls accompanied dinner meals and were generously re-offered.

We feel Chef was outstanding in bringing out the natural flavours and textures of food. Fine asparagus cooked to perfection and then chilled almost put the caviar in second place! Pork Tenderloin with Glazed Honey captured our taste buds. Some may think it strange that chicken supreme should rate as a top dish. This was obviously a free range bird and perfectly prepared and cooked. Desserts were extremely good and in all cases were a lovely blend of different textures and flavours the merged so well. We can highly recommend the posset!

Bailiffscourt is dog friendly and initially is seems child friendly too.

Near reception is a large basket with a notice “Buckets and Spades” Children please use our buckets and spades to take down to Climping beach for your enjoyment – Please return after use. (see photo)

Reality is that the nearest safe and shelving beach is to the East and many beaches away and beyond the Beach Café. There are warnings on other beaches by the Environmental Agency “Caution Vertical Drop” and “Caution Exposed Beach Debris”. The situation is no better turning West from the hotel path as there are steep drops between different beach levels and from the pathway alongside the beaches to the beach itself (see photos).

Children have restricted use of the swimming pool between 10 am and 11.00 am and 3.30 pm and 5.00 pm

 This seems reasonable to protects the peace and tranquillity expected by adult members of the Spa.

We appreciate that only larger hotels can budget for specialist facilities and dedicated support for children. Nevertheless Bailiffcourt could perhaps do a little more to compensate for the unsafe beach area and the need to control pool entry access

Our picture of one of the resident peacocks in full display is a reminder of the warning not to park under the tree where it roosts!

Needed to delete my May review for a lunchtime visit to post the above review for a stay at the hotel. Copy of the May review for the lunchtime visit follows:-

Five star official Food Hygiene rating and friendly helpful staff
Review of Bailiffscourt Hotel

""The drone incident closing Gatwick airport together with the responses of ABTA and the travel company were the final straw leading to the cancellation of our Turkish holiday.

To replace some of our lost holiday we did internet searches to find hotels in the UK that had swimming pools. Bailiffscourt Hotel headed the list. This jewel of a country hotel was on our doorstep and we had lived decades in the area without being aware of what was on offer.

There was a special lunchtime promotion and we decided to have a look around with a view to taking a short break..

What an impressive restaurant in a medieval building!. Congratulations to the 1920's architect, craftsmen and the designers that created this convincing replica and authentic looking furnishings and fittings!

Quiet, spacious grounds of 30 acres were an immediate hit for us as were the heatied inside and outside pools and gym.

Lauren our waitress was extremely helpful in creating an attractive menu from the lunchtime special combined with items from the main menu. The only proviso was that the main course must come from the lunchtime menu for us to enjoy the special lunchtime discount.

Table service was elegant, friendly and efficient but for us the food was underwhelming. The display of many awards in the foyer suggest we could be wrong.. Sadly the highest five star official food hygiene rating was not there. We found from the Government website it had been issued on 12th March 2019.

Initial reaction to the butter and bread served with the starter lobster soup was that it was all too salty. The lobster soup had a great shellfish flavour and the shredded cheese and aioli merged well.

When a main course of cod was oversalted we mentioned this to Lauren who advised that if we came again she could inform the chef of our preference. They are able to cater for many special dietary requirements. It was sad that the cod was in fish cakes was so overcome by the cooking process and oversalted dressing that it was almost impossible to detect the flavour of the cod!

The finale of Eton Mess included large chunks of fresh merengue

We felt that the meal was not good value for food protein content. There seemed to be some disregard for the need to compliment the natural flavour of the meat or fish with the appropriate adequately but not oversalted sauces.

In compensation we felt the grounds and facilities at Baiiffscout offset the restaurant problems and............we have booked a short break.""

A beautiful English Manor house with a wonderful history to boot. The spa is an addition to the side of the old house and looks like a modern glass house with a barn theme.
We were greeted at the reception and given instructions on our day which all seemed fine. They were having some technical problems so there were no lights in the rather stuffy smelling changing room.The toilet ( just the one) had small candle like tea lights so you could see the seat,
We got changed into nice robes and went for coffee.The coffee machine was only partly working so we reported to passing staff.
We had a pleasant morning and lunch was delicious.Our treatments were very good.The rest area had water but nothing else.We had afternoon tea which was lovely. The reception staff were pleasant enough if you asked a question but the general feeling was that no one really cared .Considering the cost of the day I felt that I had been to better spas and even one of their sister venues gave better service .This is a beautiful place to visit but the staff need to up their game to make it a special experience .

We obviously didn’t have our robes from our room at that point and apparently the robes at the spa are only for people having treatments but the spa staff arranged for ours to be sent over. We were given flip flops on request. The spa was very clean and although there aren’t probably enough sun loungers at all times they are very good at regularly checking to ensure people haven’t just left towels on beds and gone away. The weather was unusually warm and sunny so it would have been nice for some loungers to be put outside for the people who hadn’t got loungers inside but there were tables and chairs. We enjoyed the outdoor pool and jacuzzi which was heated and were so lucky that the weather was so beautiful during our stay. Changing rooms were fine with 2 hairdryers ( but no straightners and nowhere to plug your own in) The complimentary tea and coffee was a lovely touch.
Our room was much nicer than anticipated with fabulous views. Gorgeous complimentary homemade cookies!
We received an invitation to 2 complimentary bellinis before dinner which was also another lovely touch.
Pre dinner drinks and canapés were excellent - as was the service. The restaurant was so pretty and nicely full and service was again excellent. The food was really good too.
The following morning we awoke to our complimentary newspaper and also enjoyed a delicious breakfast with lots of choice. Poached eggs cooked to perfection! Again, very friendly service.
After checking out we were welcome to use the spa again for as long as we like liked and we then enjoyed a stroll around the grounds and down to the beach.
We finished with coffee and more delicious cookies sitting in the sun before we sadly had to leave.
Overall, the most lovely stay in a beautiful hotel. Every single member of staff were so friendly and made us feel so welcome. Thank you Bailiffscourt and we cannot wait to return!

The accommodations were of the highest comfort; beds super comfy, a fireplace in the room, nice bath amenities, robes supplied, every luxury. We used the pool/sauna/steam and found all facilities to be in perfect working order and immaculately clean. My friend availed herself of a massage and facial, and said both were done to high standard.
 We found the food to be delicious and the service attentive, and friendly.

Those looking for contemporary glitz and chrome - or those expecting genuine historic aged buildings with an intriguing past - may not be satisfied here. Hence, perhaps, some of the negative reviews ? But for those seeking quality, comfort, tranquil surroundings, excellent food and service plus a modern Spa facility, then this is the place to stay.
Bailiffscourt is an oddity. Despite its old style appearance it is a psuedo property - built
only 80 years ago as a gentleman's home in a medieval style using some materials salvaged from past ages and then later modernised into an hotel.The result is quirky to say the least - but it works and has an almost authentic feel. There are several separate buildings in the grounds and the 39 bedrooms are scattered amongst them - thus styles do vary. The rooms are well appointed with smart modern bathrooms. The public rooms all appear to be in the main building so a room there is preferable to a walk across the grounds in the dark to dinner.The predominately young staff are enthusiastic and willing; service is prompt and friendly. The standard of food was excellent, well presented, varied and tasty with a choice from 3 menus. The general atmosphere is relaxed and calm.
 We enjoyed our few days here immensely and would certainly recommend it. Probably best for older. more discerning guests, but families there seemed to be enjoying the excellent Spa and grounds just as much.

We have visited on two previous occasions and thoroughly enjoyed the park, the facilities and the accommodation. However this time we were sorely disappointed.

The accommodation
I’m not expecting the Ritz but I expect a decent level of cleanliness. On this occasion this level was not met. The master bedroom had severe mould issues and the shower was filthy. My elderly in laws had checked in early and by the time we arrived at the caravan, my kids were tired so I decided not to make a fuss about the state if it and to just get everyone to bed.

We were in the master double, an average sized bed and bizarrely the sheets didn’t fit the bed. The bottom sheet didn’t cover the sides if the mattress and the cover didn’t fit the duvet. It all felt very unhygienic. By the time I got up to reception there was a massive queue and the family group were ready to go out so I didn’t get it sorted. I should have chased this but difficult with a large family party.

The space in the living area was very small. My elderly in laws had trouble squeezing between the table and the kitchen bench. The layout could have been much better.

The Facilities
The pool was great, the kids had a fab time using the park facilities. Unfortunately the kids early evening entertainment was so dark that it was difficult keeping tabs on your children; I was with them on the dance floor but it was nightclub style lighting which felt inappropriate given the audience. Some of the Halloween shows were a bit scary for the younger kids, and if I’m honest, we’re a bit boring. There was very little interaction, more a sit and watch show rather than dancing or games.

The Staff
The staff were generally friendly and helpful, particularly the guard in the gate.

The restaurant
The Mash and Barrell was very average but fine for an easy meal out.

Roy on the gate at arrival was welcoming as always and really does give the site a wonderful first impression to visitors.

The kids had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed all the activities. Special mention must again go to Harry the sports coach who is patient, enthusiastic and fantastic with the children. He is one of the reasons we came back as the kids wanted to see him again!!

A couple of suggestions would be to boost the wi-if as it was patchy at times, and as the football is so popular maybe an organised game at a certain time every day on the pitch would be a good idea?

First impressions were great, check in was easy and the caravan easy to find with reassurance of 24 hr security on site etc. Parked up next to the van, we stayed on Old Nine, nice location and very peaceful.

Caravan was really good too.. 3 bed, lots of seating and living space, bedrooms slightly smaller then have experienced before but you only sleep in those right.

Loads on offer for eating on site, good variety of fish and chips which we had first night, ate in Mash and Barrel the 2nd and had the carvery on Sunday... All really good and fairly priced.

On Saturday we went to the Mash and Barrel at lunchtime to watch the football. This was the only downside... Was a real battle from us and about 8 or 9 other parties to get them to put it on. They advertised the Rugby and said had to have this on but NO ONE in the pub was watching Japan v Samoa... They eventually went round and asked everyone if they were watching it and not a single person said yes, they genuinely were not watching it and football was put on... BTW the rugby advertised as yiu walked in was the earlier England match I believe. I would have taken my business to an establishment elsewhere off site has sense not been seen here.

Entertainment team in the evening worked really hard, especially I believe a young lady called Shanice who was constantly on the go with the children and then again really active when the live acts were on. Well done team, credit to the resort.

Overall, really enjoyed the stay for couple of nights... Would go again.

Check in was pretty fast apart from a slight glitch in the system but they explained what had happened and we waited in the waiting area and a lady came over to us to go through check in with us, and what was available on site and showed us points on the map etc, was very helpful.
We had the standard caravan and i have to say it was really nice, was a lot better than i was expecting for a cheap price. Was spotlessly clean and fresh and had everything we needed in there (cups, plates, cooking pots etc). I know you have to bring your own tea towels and washing liquid etc so we had that with us.
We also had a really nice spot which didn't have much foot traffic passing through and we were 2 mins from the nature trail walk which we did and it was really nice with lots of greenery and some horses to view on your walk. It leads to the Harbour and the Lagoon too, the latter which we also went to visit and fed the ducks and swans there from the bridge.
The club house we only used briefly as our son is a bit young still to join in but we saw a kids show for a bit which was ok and the toddlers were up dancing and having a good time it seems.
We didn't really eat much on site as we did our own cooking but we did get a portion of chips from the chippy by the arcade and they were delicious.
We didn't use all the facilities as again our child is a bit young but there did seem plenty to keep kids occupied and would definitely return again when he is a bit older.

347,1468,1026,Littlehampton,2,"Dirty Prestige caravan, our fears realised We haven't stayed at a Haven site for many years but have happy memories of the fun our own and friends children had at the Combe Haven and Lower Hyde parks (the latter no longer a Haven park)
Unfortunately these visits were often spoilt for the adults of our groups by poor cleaning standards. It’s not right but 'you' come to expect to carry out a certain level of cleaning yourself. I see other reviewers have a similar opinion. A sad situation for customers to endure for the sake of providing an enjoyable family holiday for the younger members.
Our recent visit, the first for many years to a Haven site was to Church Farm Pagham where our worst fears were realised. We booked in July, too late to hire a newer model unlike the friends we planned to meet who had managed to do so.
A newer caravan was something that had become a must for us many years ago just in order to stand a better chance of a nicer, cleaner caravan, so we were optimistic but apprehensive.
Initial impressions of the site were good although we did not stay long enough to see exactly how good the facilities were.
We'd hired a Prestige with decking, and were able to book in early at about 1300 which was a plus.
First impression of the outside of the caravan wasn't great especially as the steps to the decking looked like they had become partly detached, this remained to be seen but in the end events negated the need to confirm this.
As the fridge-freezer is close to the side door it was the first item checked and to our surprise it was very clean, from there on it went steeply downhill.
Dirty or sticky cup marks on coffee table, (not burns that couldn’t have been wiped off). Food remnants on work-tops, cutlery / crockery drainer and washing-up bowl.
Kitchen cabinet door handles sticky and greasy. Edging missing from work-top . Floors not properly swept or vacuumed. Crumbs under stained, drab, dowdy soft furnishings that we certainly didn't relish sitting or laying on. The table and chairs ; you could get better and cleaner from your local charity / second hand shop.
Bottom of net curtains in all rooms appeared stained (brownish) from condensation possibly.
Our fears realised ; and any optimism gone I phoned the site office to ask if there were any chance of an up-grade (at our expense) possibly to a newer model. Unfortunately nothing was available and the only solution that could be offered was a cleaning team to clean again.
In our view it would have taken many hours to bring the caravan up to an acceptable standard so this was not a viable option. (Ideally it also needed an upholsterer and a carpet fitter) . We realised we had no choice but return home…….120 miles , so not a decision made lightly especially as our friends would be expecting us later that day.
The staff were polite and apologetic but this doesn't alter the fact that they were unable to provide a suitable solution especially when there were only two of us.
We were told we would get a full refund but this would take up to seven days.
Not having the greatest confidence in Haven I waited a day to check what progress had been made with the refund. In short nothing had been done. Again staff were polite and apologetic and I’m told this is now in hand: I shall have to see what happens next.
It's obviously more cost effective to loose a customer and give a refund than put the problem right. Putting the problem right may involve paying more for better cleaners, giving them more time, supervising them effectively, replacing old or worn items of furniture curtains cushions etc. etc. so I guess nothing will change.
I have scored 2 of 5 only because the site seemed ok. The caravan itself didn't really justify a 1.

We realised we had no choice but return home…….120 miles , so not a decision made lightly especially as our friends would be expecting us later that day.
The staff were polite and apologetic but this doesn't alter the fact that they were unable to provide a suitable solution especially when there were only two of us.
We were told we would get a full refund but this would take up to seven days.
Not having the greatest confidence in Haven I waited a day to check what progress had been made with the refund. In short nothing had been done. Again staff were polite and apologetic and I’m told this is now in hand: I shall have to see what happens next.
It's obviously more cost effective to loose a customer and give a refund than put the problem right. Putting the problem right may involve paying more for better cleaners, giving them more time, supervising them effectively, replacing old or worn items of furniture curtains cushions etc. etc. so I guess nothing will change.
I have scored 2 of 5 only because the site seemed ok. The caravan itself didn't really justify a 1.

349,1474,1027,Littlehampton,4,"Accommodation Perfect When booking a caravan at this site, i had no idea which one to go for as iv never stayed at any Haven site before. Middle of August, everything was overpriced so my only option was to take a standard caravan. Im glad to report it was 90% perfect!

Upon entering reception to check in, i was offered for an additional £60 the opportunity to upgrade to a deluxe caravan. Although the offer sounded tempting, after already paying so much i wasnt interested in paying anymore. At that stage i wasnt sure if i had made a mistake but upon entering the caravan i was super surprised. Our Caravan felt modernish and wasnt ugly at all. No old applicances or furniture. It all looked up to date and good.

When we came in i had brought cleaning supplies after reading they may be necessary, but all linen on beds was clean and fresh, the toilets had a just been cleaned sealed with wrapper on it and overall it didnt feel dirty at all which was my biggest worry! If i was going to knit pik, the area round the toaster did have some small crumbs, but i could see hownit was missed on a busy textured counter. I was happpy i didnt upgrade at reception.The caravan came equipped with all pots and pans but the reason we came to haven was because it gave us tbe ability to cook. As a kosher keeping family we brought all our own pots with us, but there was space to store it all thankfully. We just about managed with the undercounter fridge, and ths freezer was just a tiny part of it but thankfully we only came for 4 nights so it wasn't a problem.

We ordered a 2 bed caravan but were given a 3 bed caravan. We were 2 adults and a 4 year old so we had 3 spare beds which csme in great use as the bedrooms are tiny! Had we not had the extra bedroom im not sure where we would have put our cases as it the extra room became our much needed dressing room. I did wonder however if they would have given us a 2 bedroom like we ordered would the bedrooms have been bigger but i will never know.

The reason i couldnt give it 100 % was because the shows in the evening didnt interest me at all, and although they did offer a good few options for my 4 year old, there wasnt enough. We were happy to do our own thing though.The beach is a 4 mins drive away/15 minute walk. Very quiet and nice but no life guard.

Overall we were happy, there isnt really anything to go back to Church Farm for but we would definitely be trying a different haven site again!

We had to purchase entertainment passes separately an they're not cheap but we made good use of them. We also purchased an activity bundle and booked a selection of free and paid activities and our girls enjoyed them all.

There was a guy based at the ranger station who really put a lot of effort into making the activities there a lot of fun.

Our caravan was a front row one located on Lagoon Drive, an advantage of private is you know where you are going to be and we also want a nice view and away from main paths to the entertainment, this area is definitely the nicest part of the park.

The clubhouse was a good size but filled up quickly and seats towards the back are not comfortable for staying all night.

The entertainment team were pretty good. There is just one indoor pool (with a baby section)....no activity pool like some others so paid for boat activities are evening only. Outdoor pool was good but the sun beds really are crammed in. Indoor pool has a water slide which is a good extra. Changing areas were ok in terms of space and cleanliness.

Playpark there is pretty good and there are some more sunbeds in that area which is nice. The pizzas available from outside the Mash & Barrel were really nice. Arcade was as you would expect, bit manic, not for everyone, the workers in there were attentive and helpful.

Onsite shop is the usual, reasonable selection of stuff and convenience pricing.

The pedal cars you can hire are a bit pricey but worth doing, we had great fun and they were some days nearly sold out for a lot of the day so very popular.

Haven provided recycling facilities as well as waste bins around the park which is a good extra.

357,1493,1046,Littlehampton,2,"Disappointed - massive change in a year Just come back from a week at a privately rented caravan. The caravan, the grounds and the majority of the staff are great and have kept a similar standard every year we have been there. However the clubhouse, restaurant have really gone down hill. The games room had no air con all week, the machines kept braking. The guys working in games area were really helpful but having used some of the machines for the last few years the difference was really quite noticeable. The restaurant, what’s happened. Price has gone up and the quality gone down. Food looks like it just thrown on the plate. Kids food supposed to come with veg, the only one that did came with raw, dried up carrot swirls that were all dried out!! Having eaten in the restaurant most nights for the last 3 years, we only went twice and said we wouldn’t go again. Salmon salad was like old bits of lettuce that should have been thrown out. Stir fry was over cooked, sloppy and tasted horrid. Chicken burger came with a small handful of thrown on chips, rest of the plate was empty. I understand it isn’t a 5* restaurant but having had some nice food and service from that restaurant before it was more noticeable. Every drink we ordered came in dirty glasses, we were told it was just water marks but they were grim with lipstick marks, old bits of dried lemon!! Tried to get a slush on three occasions, each time the machine wasn’t working. It’s a shame as the clubhouse as always been good value for money but this time it was awful.

358,1499,1048,Littlehampton,4,"Fun filled family holiday  We got home yesterday from a Monday to Friday stay after a weekend in Butlins - which is only down the road.
Arrived to somebody complaining at reception which meant the reception staff were distracted and I didn’t get much of a ‘warm’ welcome. But I did get an apology which was nice.
We had a deluxe 2 bedroom caravan which was brilliantly located in church meadows but had a horrible smell to it and wasn’t clean inside. We brought febreeze, anti bac wipes and bleach spray and had a good clean ourselves which made it better. We really needed to wash the sheets and hoover everywhere too, but this wasn’t possible or practicable.
The evening entertainment is absolutely brilliant and we loved it! This was probably the highlight of our holiday.
We brought our 2 year old a little ‘anxious the elephant’ teddy and somebody took it from her whilst on the dance floor. I told a couple of the entertainment team and they were so understanding and told me to speak to security because sometimes the parents of the children who take these toys, do the right thing and make their children hand them back. This didn’t happen in our case!
But, about 10 mins later, one of the entertainment team that I had spoken to, came towards me with a little replacement! She said she had spoken to the entertainment manager and he said it was ok for her to replace it, in case we didn’t find the one we had lost. It was the loveliest thing anyone has ever done! It made our holiday! This gesture alone would make me come back.
I’m sure the girls name was Emily! I really hope somebody reads this and passes on our gratitude to her! She deserves extra special praise for doing something so kind and for making our holiday so special.
The entertainment team in general are some of the best we have come across, and so friendly.
In fact, all of the staff at Church Farm are really friendly and nice.
The outdoor pool is heated and so fun!
The park is lovely and the outdoor seating is great, with loads of sun loungers and comfortable chairs and tables on the terrace.
If our caravan had of been clean and didn’t have the horrible smell our stay literally would have been perfect! I hope we were just unlucky with this.
We look forward to returning and we are already planning our trips for next year!
Thank you Emily!! (I really hope that’s her name - she’s the one with the lovely red hair!) You made our holiday so special!! Please pass this onto her!

359,1512,1055,Littlehampton,4,"Great stay at Church Farm - lovely park, friendly staff! We have just returned from a lovely 2 week stay at Church Farm. This was our fourth visit to a Haven park and we really enjoyed it. Church Farm is not as big as say Hafan y Mor but the park is beautifully kept and has several features that make it worth a visit.
First of all the staff were fantastic and really made our stay enjoyable. Our 3 girls absolutely loved Ranger Oakley so compliments to him! He really put a lot of effort and humour into the Nature Rockz activities and was by far the best ranger at the parks we’ve visited. The girls also loved the lifeguard (Adam?) who joined in the pool activities, they had loads of fun playing with him. Everyone else was good-humoured and helpful, even the security guards were really nice right down to the cheery wave goodbye as we left. It makes a huge difference so please pass on our thanks to all the staff.
There was an issue with our accommodation on the first night and this was really well handled at reception so thanks for that also.
Our accommodation was very clean and well kept, no signs of wear and tear or poor housekeeping anywhere. All the public areas looked great. You can walk to the lagoon from the park which was lovely and peaceful.
The outdoor pool was beautiful and Sussex has lots of sunny weather so we were able to enjoy it. The water was lovely and warm – I hate cold pool water so I was delighted with this! The pool areas were well maintained and there were plenty of attentive lifeguards. The indoor pool was fine too, just in the sunshine it was nicer to be outside.
I love the outdoor terrace area with a view of the outdoor pool and direct access to the playground. You could eat from the Mash and Barrel or The Terrace pizza here or have a drink at the lovely rattan seating areas. Compliments also to the man who runs The Terrace at the weekends, really good fun.
The park also has an outdoor sports/games area, basketball court, tennis court, covered activities range and Water Walkerz / Bungee Trampolines which were perhaps my only quibble with the park. You can’t book the last 2 in advance with your activity passes, and I had to complain after 4 times in a row asking to use the Water Walkerz only to be told come back later – they did in the end send someone over to run them for us. I appreciate they don’t want a staff member sitting beside them day in day out in case someone wants to use them, but I think you should be able to book a time or a ticket in some way rather than having to keep on asking.
We didn’t eat in the Mash and Barrel as it’s always mediocre at any Haven park. We ate at Cooks & Co fish and chips out of necessity and it was just ok but expensive. The Terrace pizza was nice but pricey. There are a few places to eat nearby in Pagham / Nyetimber but they are a bit of a walk away so better to drive if you have small children.
The arcade area was of course popular with the kids as it always is, they love those 2p machines!!!
The regular evening shows weren’t amazing. The entertainment crew were enthusiastic but I think the shows could do with a bit of a revamp. Check out the visiting acts though – in our second week there was a comedian and he was excellent, we all enjoyed his show.
Apart from the friendly staff and the park amenities, it’s a great area for a holiday. The weather is lovely and there is so much to do in the area. Chichester city is only a few minutes away. Portsmouth is half an hour away and there is loads to see and do, we went back for 2 days (if you buy a Historic Dockyard ticket it is good for a year from the date of issue – just be warned, the Mary Rose requires a separate ticket). Brighton is an hour away. We also went further afield to Legoland and Chessington.
For groceries there are lots of shops around: Pagham has a Co-op around the corner from Church Farm and a Tesco express. Chichester has a lot of shops. There are also superstores in the area around Havant including a massive Asda.
We had a lovely time at Haven Church Farm and would definitely recommend it!

362,1524,1070,Littlehampton,3,"We consistently received less than we paid for Just returned from a three night stay. We were a family of four adults, four children and a newborn, and we have mixed reviews of the park.

Overall we found the staff pleasant and personable and the facilities good. The location is beautiful and there are plenty of activities to keep the whole family happy. However, we found the service lacking in that we had to keep asking to be provided with things we’ve already paid for and where we forgot to ask, or grew tired of querying, we ended up going without.

Firstly, I have concerns about their grading system. We paid for two caravans, one for our immediate family and one for my sister-in-law and her children. We paid extra for an upgrade on our caravan (from deluxe to prestige) to be sure there was central heating as we have a 9 week old baby. However, the upgrade felt like a downgrade since the deluxe was far superior to the prestige. We stayed in 87 Church Meadow, which had dirty floors, a filthy and broken mop, and the bedroom had a lingering smell of urine. The living area was tilted as the concrete foundations at one end are crumbling and so the caravan is at an angle. We also had a few things missing that we’d paid for, and had to phone up reception three times in the first 24 hours to get things addressed.

However, we spent most of the time outside in the glorious sunshine so we put up with a few niggles in the caravan, particularly as we had to phone reception three times already - we didn’t want to spend the whole holiday time complaining.

Also, the other caravan we booked (28 Wallfield) was impeccable, clean, and had features that our prestige did not (Bluetooth speakers, a dishwasher, etc) despite it being a deluxe. And so we were very happy with that caravan and it’s value.

But on Sunday afternoon, the missing burger sauce in my burger was the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back. It sounds really petty, but after having to query a long list of small errors in the two and a half days we had been there, it was becoming tedious and we left the park on Monday morning feeling a little like Haven was trying to see what it could get away with charging for but not providing.

When we arrived we had to phone reception when we realised the bedrail we’d paid for was missing. We then had to phone a second time to get the linens for one of the beds. We also discovered that the heating was broken in the middle of the first night when it got chilly and my toddler and newborn were cold. Maintenance came round the next day and told us the touch unit was broken and had been wired out so we had to control the heating with some dials in a cupboard. So clearly it was a problem Haven was aware of because the wiring had been adapted to ‘fix’ the issue, and yet there were no instructions on the main heating control to say it was broken and how to operate it. Having said that, in one of their higher grade caravans it should’ve been repaired properly in the first place. So we ended up spending one night out of the three (and the coldest night at that) without the heating that we’d paid the extra for in our upgrade. And on top of the shabby condition of the van, these problems meant that it was definitely not ‘prestigious’ accommodation at all. There was no compensation offered for this or any of the other problems we encountered.

There were other little things missing that were meant to be included. There was no Bluetooth speaker in our caravan, for example. I mentioned it (along with some of the other issues) to the staff-member at checkout and she said that the previous renter must have stolen it and this is something that happens sometimes and we could’ve got one if we had let them know. But as I said earlier, after having to chase up so many little things it wasn’t worth the hassle. And it should be something they check for before checking in new guests if they have it happening to them frequently.

Also, the restaurant frequently failed to bring us all our orders. The kids meals particularly were an issue. On the menu it said that all the kids meals came with a bowl vegetables and a juice. We were never brought either of these and again, we were tired of chasing up the service we were already paying for. Again, it’s a pretty petty complaint but for four children eating meals everyday at the Mash and Barrel, it all adds up.

Overall, we had a nice time at Church Farm because it was glorious weather, we were with our family and the location was lovely. But after reflecting on all the little things that irritated us, and querying it all with reception I am still unsure of what our upgrade cost actually paid for and I think that they’ve got a lot of work to do in improving their service if we are ever to return. I mentioned our concerns at reception and left the feedback card with them, and I can see that management read reviews on here, so there should in theory be no excuse for not addressing these issues for future customers.

363,1527,1072,Littlehampton,3,"Underwhelmed  Just completed 2 weeks at Church Farm, this was our 11th or 12th visit and we usual stay here at least twice a year as it’s a lovely site with easy access to Portsmouth and The Isle of Wight.
Have stayed in various Platinum and Prestige caravans all over the site and as the years go by the level of cleanliness and the standard of caravan has dropped.

Was given 6 Fairways and was told nice quiet bit of the park, firstly the 3 bed Prestige “New” model was filthy! The floor was unswept, the fridge door was dirty and there were unwashed bowls in the cupboard, unfortunately we have come to expect this and always clean when we get in the caravan, usually the twin bedrooms are snug but the main bedroom is roomy, not in this case, all 3 bedrooms were unusually small and we had to dress in the hallway as this was the only place with any legroom!

The quiet location at Fairways was questionable, while we were there 7th till 21 June, there were contractors digging a ditch and relaying turf, this went on for most of our stay and we played dodge the work van and machinery anytime we left the caravan, also Fairways overlooks the golf course, lovely view but open to the wind, people teeing off outside the window and the course gets mowed every day, for hours a day!
Didn’t bother complaining whilst there as we have had reason to complain before and found a general lack of interest and nothing gets done, I suggest haven have a rethink about the ranking and pricing of their caravans and bring back some with enough room in the bedroom to put your trousers on !

With NO apology and says “ it’s the second time that mans been in” my wife reply’s “ it’s the second time for us as well” he goes to hand the keys over to then take them back and says “yours isn’t ready yet” and starts talking to the man again and also gave him some vouchers.

366,1542,1080,Littlehampton,3,"Ok, but not great for older kids. Just back from 4 nights at Church Farm Haven.
Firstly the good bits. Our caravan was lovely, spacious, well equipped and very clean.
The grounds around the site are really lovely, the gardeners are always out and about keeping it looking great.
The activity staff are really friendly and great with the kids, many of whom seemed to have few manners.
On to the negatives. The mattresses in the caravan were all lumpy and uncomfortable, all 6 of them!!
The cleanliness of the swimming pools was very poor. The changing rooms were disgusting and no where near enough. The floors were dirty as there was no enforcement of the no shoe rule. People were walking through in muddy trainers, there was grass and dirt, mixed with stale water.
The water the pools was very chlorinated, which I do understand, but there was a lot of hair floating around, in both the inside and outside pools. Disgusting when it kept getting wrapped around my kids' fingers. I think there should be a requirement for long hair to be tied back or swimming caps to be worn. It spoilt swimming a few times for us.
The show room is SO dark and dingy. It's a sticky floor/table venue with very long queues for drinks. There are no where enough table for a site this size. In fact that's a problem here, hundreds of caravans but not a lot of facilities.
Dogs are welcome but aren't allowed in the bar area. So they have to stay in the van anytime you go out.
Lastly, there is very little for young teens or older kids to do. Most activities are aimed at younger children, there is no place for older kids to go other than the arcades. Somewhere like a social club for kids to hang out and make friends would be great.
Having said that the groups of children that wandered around swearing and dropping litter probably wouldn't appreciate that. But I'm sure there would be many who would.
This is a good place if you have young children, not for older children. There is not enough to do and the swimming pool and changing areas are unpleasant.

The place is clean and all the staff are lovely and friendly. There are ents for the family along with a swimming pool, amusement arcade, fish and chip shop, pub and launderette and shop.
The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because of the prices in the pub - safe to say they have never heard of happy hour - 2 gin and tonics and nuts was over £16. We didn't bother eating there because of this but went into Pagham. I am sure they would be a lot busier if they kept the prices low (think Wetherspoons - to be honest the quality isn't dissimilar but the prices are much higher).

370,1556,1087,Littlehampton,5,"Great staff, interesting caravan. After getting back from a fantastic stay at haven I felt that I had to comment.
Firstly the staff are amazing. Calum and reni who ran the day events were brilliant. They got to know my kids names and made so much effort everytime We saw them. My kids wanted to take part in the events so they could play with the 2 of them.

The show team were also equally amazing. Shanice and her team. Josh, Emily x2 and Kayleigh all the rest.
The others were brilliant. The resort was quiet this week and they got To know my girls which made the experience personal And even better. Despite the small number of guest they put 110% in to every performance/meet and greet. They had my kids on stage multiple times for various things. It was my youngest 4th birthday and they made such a effort for her. Inviting her on stage and getting the audience to sing happy birthday to her. She still won’t stop talking about it.

The staff really made the trip. There was a couple of minor gripes. The caravan smelt of sewage on a fair few occasions, lack of equipment that worked fully for Callum to work with and some of cleanliness around park wasn’t great.

These small things didn’t ruin the trip and we hope to be back later in the year. Thank you to all the staff for working so hard and going the extra mile all the time.

You made 2 girls very happy.

A nice warm greeting from Ray at the entrance to the park, who directed us to the reception desk. An easy check in, lots of staff waiting to check you in quickly. The caravan was spotlessly clean, the van didn’t smell or look tired. It was an upgrade pd modern caravan with 3 bedrooms and an en-suite, large fridge, central heating and had a small decking area outside. The park is a quiet park which suited my oap parents. They love it here, as it’s picturesque and peaceful. The lagoon and shingled bench is worth a visit and the nature trail is pretty. Remember to take your binoculars to be able to see some wildlife. The indoor pool was clean, the arcade centre has lots of 2p machines( so start saving them) most of the machines payout tickets and there’s lots of prizes to chose from. My parents played lawn bowls and really enjoyed it, there’s also a zip wire and large trampoline. The average price of a pint is £4 and above. Bar area was clean and tidy, lots of seating available. Overall a really nice relaxing holiday. This won’t be the last visit, can’t wait to rebook and return. Keep up the good work at Church farm as it’s the best Haven site I have visited so far!

I would like to make a special mention of the gentleman who is at the entrance and a young lad in the amusement centre. The gentleman at the entrance had a permanent smile and gave a friendly greeting to all. Such a gentleman he put a smile on our faces whenever we saw him. A young lad in the amusements, was such a lovely lad and was always pleasant, helpful and friendly to the children in our party. I believe his name is Oliver. Thank you Haven for a lovely weekend.

374,1569,1095,Littlehampton,5,"A great family holiday Stayed here with our 2 children aged 11 and 13 for a week in a standard caravan. On arrival check in very quick and easy. Great to find we had been upgraded from the two bedroom caravan we had booked to a three bedroom.
Van was adequate for all our needs.
The whole park is very clean and well maintained.
The pool was great for my boys and they really enjoyed the football coaching session they did on the Saturday afternoon. A special mention must go to the coach (we can't remember his name?) Who was fantastic. The kayaking session the boys did on the Tuesday evening at 7.30 wasn't so good...
We were told they had to be at the pool side ten minutes before the start time for instructions and a safety talk. Well, they stood for at least 15 minutes watching the group before theirs having all sorts of fun. When they eventually got the previous group out of the pool and it was my boys turn, the group was asked of they had done kayaking before my boys hadn't but the rest of the group had. So no instructions were given or any talk on safety. It was practically straight into the kayaks. They got about five minutes using the oars and then did silly games and their session certainly didn't over run like they one before!! It felt like they didn't get same .session as the previous group because the staff doing it wanted to get home.
The Mash and Barrel pub restaurant was good with great service.
The entertainment in the showroom was a bit young for my boys. If anything could be done better it would be maybe having more on offer on teenagers, alot of the activities we're too young for him.
Other than the kayaking, everything was great and my children would love to return.

We booked a prestige 2 bedroom but got given a 3 bedroom one - this meant the bedrooms were small so we couldn't put the cot in our room. We had to try and fold a bed in one room and balance the spare mattress on another bed. Caravan was mostly clean but no batteries in either TV remote and the blind cable broke in the bathroom. We were in a very quiet area at the back of the park. Site was clean and well kept. All staff were friendly. Food in restaurant was reasonably priced and varied. Food in chip shop was ok. Swimming pool was an ok size with unisex changing rooms. Wasnt very busy on site while we were there but the Saturday and Friday night was busy in restaurant and hard to find a table. We visited lots of places in the area including fishers farm, staunton farm, Portsmouth sealife, weald and downland museum, Arundel castle and marwell zoo

376,1576,1100,Littlehampton,4,"Pleasantly Surprised! This caravan park was spotless, as was our caravan. We were very happy with arrivals and reception, and was taken aback by how big the site is! We haven't stayed as a family in a caravan park before and we are so glad that we choose here.

We had a good 3 night break. We took a 25min drive to West Wittering SANDY beach (reception recommended it to us). It was wonderful so make sure you make the effort to go here if it's sunny!

We saw the evening entertainment one night, but our two year old was more interested in the amusements and free soft play in the evening. One thing that did bother us was that to get to the restaurant, evening entertainment and playground you have to walk through the amusements first - which delayed us trying to get our child away from everything!

Highly recommend Pagham Beach Café for lunch, we went here twice, you can sit outside too. Fish and chips and fish burger and milkshakes were good.

My only issues with this holiday was that I didn't sleep very well due to an uncomfortable mattress on the double bed (number 42 Wall Field). I think they could do with upgrading them if possible. I did try to sleep on a twin bed - but these are really meant for children as they are so slim, I thought that I would fall out if I turned over. My other half didn't have any trouble sleeping. So it might be just me with a bad part of the bed.

We would like to go back one day, and just hope for a more comfortable sleeping experience for me!

It was clean but it wasn’t perfect, bedhind the sofa and under the dining table was dusty and dirty but other than that was ok. Curtain ties frayed and broken and also the radiator in the en suite wasn’t working, not the end of the world but when it’s prestige expected a little more. Facilities were great. Loved the swimming pool and outdoor parks. We didn’t try the Mash and Barrell for food only drinks. Evening entertainment was ok, very busy in the show room with no seats available on the Saturday night. Very close to a big pebble beach which we walked too, wasn’t very pram friendly but we managed ok! Overall well kept park would definitely visit again.

Was a bit surprised no wardrobe, had hangers on a rack. 2 bottles of water available with the normal teA/ coffee facilities. Nice touches. The bathroom was lovely and had a double shower. Bathrobes and slippers provided which again was a nice touch. I don't believe the room was worth the price but I would still recommend for the location and a nice room/shower.

The only negative is there was a lot of dust under the beds!

We also booked a table for dinner. Probably a little pricey but the food/service was excellent. Presented very well. The breakfast which was also included in the room cost, was great.

Negatives - it was apparent that there was a lack of staff and being a bank holiday, there should have been more. The staff were however very Approachable and helpful and can't thank them enough. They worked hard. Such a shame they didn't have more people to support them.

The location was brilliant. However there is no parking available at the hotel, but directly behind there is a pay and display car park. We paid £7.00 for 24 hours !

Arundel is lovely and the castle is worth a visit.

We were welcomed by friendly staff and told where our room was. First impressions good, nice room with character. Clean room although there was some black mould in a small section of the shower.
The Swan has everything going for it, it just lacked attention to detail.

What do I mean by that?
1) there was no milk in the room for the tea or coffee in the room. I told the staff in the morning after our first night. Still no milk on the second night.
2) a lovely roll top bath in the bathroom, but no plug. Again informed staff on the first night, nothing done about it.
3) the second morning at breakfast we were asked if we wanted white or brown toast. We requested white. Mixed toast arrived after our full English arrived. Previous day it had arrived prior.
4) the coffee pot at breakfast had dry coffee dribbles all down one side.
5) the shower drain in our room was partially blocked. So by the time you finished showering you were standing in two inches of water in the tray.

You may think that my comments are harsh and picky. However when paying £120 a night for effectively a B&B, with the items above we felt disappointed and left us wishing we had booked an alternative.

We were meeting with friends and started with a drink in the bar all good but the ladies toilets weren’t the cleanest and started with having to kick dirty toilet paper from the lid no excuse as the pub wasn’t even busy . check in was good and speedy and we were offered help with luggage to our room . We were given a room on the top floor in the eves which got a bit warm but a large fan was provided albeit a little noisey. Beds comfy and clean . Carpet could be cleaner and bathroom not the best but did have a shower and roll top bath . Bathroom could do with a deep clean as skirtings etc were dusty . Shower was ok but large rain drop attachment trickled and the base filled up rapidly so guessing the trap needed a good clean out , the shower door also didn’t shut properly . Towels robes and slippers were provided . Tea and coffee supplied in the room but no milk . When wanting to the leave the room in the morning we couldn’t unlock the door as the lock was faulty , quick call to reception and they came and got us out but god forbid if a fire had broken out in the night as we would have been trapped with no exit from any windows as we were top floor . Breakfast was very good and plenty on offer included in with our room price and service was excellent. The dining room could do with a long duster round the roof windows as large cobwebs hung above us as we ate breakfast.We were told by our friends when they arrived in their room the previous occupants had not vacated the room completely and had left their luggage ,strange if rooms were cleaned before we arrived .

We like to stay in pubs with accommodation and while we like to find independent places, this turned out to be our 3rd visit to a Fuller's pub. Having enjoyed our other 2 we were happy to book this one, knowing what we'd be getting.
This one didn't quite live up to the high standards of the others we'd been to in London, but was still a good stay. Staff were very friendly, the room was not huge but perfectly fine for our one night. The bathroom was huge with a lovely roll top bath; the only thing missing was a little more storage/shelf space. There was more than enough room to have something besides a fairly shallow window ledge. Nice touch was the provision of towelling robes and slippers. I always enjoy having either big towels or robes :)
Tea/coffee making facilities were provided but we had to go ask for spoons, and then later realised there was no milk, which was a little irritating.
Breakfast was fine, good choice of buffet and cooked breakfast options.
The hotel is well placed right in the town. There is a pay & display car park to the rear of the hotel which charges £7 I think for 4+ hours. That actually covers 24hrs which suited us fine and saved us having to come out again in the morning to top up the meter.
If we came back to Arundel I would have no problem staying here again

- Great location in town
- High quality food for English breakfast..perfectly cooked, prepared and presented
-Room size just right not to big or small (I had room number 3)..Room no #2 was the same but no 1 is too small (cheaper price?). There are more rooms available (16?)
-the bed frame was rigid and had firm mattress...had a good night sleep.
- Not much noise from traffic given its central locality
-The linen was clean n' crisp and smelt fresh
-The style condition of the decor was refreshing...not like Premier Inn/Travel Lodge I am used too.
-Great value stay
-Lots of eatery in the town including The Swan (check Sunday Lunch)....especially Chinese...which needs a mention.

Bad Points
- Car parking needs taking into account given its central locality and small town population. The town is not set up for hoards of tourists principally visiting the castle and cathedral .... But with a little local knowledge and you will be fine. Ring the receptionist before you set out.
-The room (#3) have no dressing table mirror.
-The room had no two pin razor / tooth charger socket..this was bad for me
-The shower had a lowish flow rate...so did have that refreshing shower in the morning.
- There is no USB connector to charge your phone.

Check was very easy and the lady that checked us in was so polite and helpful, taking our bags to our room even though it was too early to check in.
The Bar area was really nice with plenty of places to sit a good choice of drinks and the food was lovely and plentiful.
the decor was really relaxing and you could happily sit there all day drinking eating and catching up with family or friends.
I ordered drinks and they were bought to the table which I thought was really nice.
The rooms were very nice, small but very clean and very cosy and comfortable.
The bathroom was really stylish and the shower was amazing.
Breakfast the nextday was delicious. There was a wide variety of fresh fruit and pastiores as well as cearealsa.
the hot food had a lovely selection and the quality and quantities were very impressive.
whilst sitting for breakfast the waiter came to the table and presented us with 4 bags, inside was a bottle of gin and a bottle of tonic.
This was all because I had said that we were there for two birthdays.
We all thought this was so nice and a great ending to a fabulous weekend.
I would definitely recommend this hotel whether for a drink food or a stay in the hotel.
we loved it.

We got to our table and had kept saying to me that something wasn't right. I saw her handed over two 20 s and he showed me the change that was €7 we'd bought 2 drinks and some squid. Seemed rather overpriced so I checked the menu and he's been short changed by a massive £10. I went back to the bar to poinr this out and the barman wad totally non plussed like this was meaningless. I was very concerned. Yes he gave us our £10 but no apology and no reparation. It's a big mistake to make.
I think most people wouldn't even realise. Made me wonder if it's a common ploy there or if they are so used to cards the staff don't take much notice of notes and don't even look at the denomination.

Very worrying...check your change carefully if you go there.
We went in this pub because it's a Fullers and does food assuming they have standards.

They have rainfall showers, a lounge area with bifold doors that open out onto a balcony with views straight out over the sea, and a lovey mezzanine bedroom with Egyptian cotton bed linen. The lounge area is beautiful and has a tv, fridge - stocked with complimentary Coke, milk, water and wine, coffee machine and tea making facilities, games and a very comfortable settee. There is also a decanter in the lounge containing complimentary sloe gin. The bathroom has a rainfall/power shower, complimentary toiletries, shaver point, toilet, heated towel rail and basin all completed to a high standard. There is a children's bedroom which we didn't use but it looked very comfortable. The mezzanine bedroom has a king size bed which was so so comfortable, a built in wardrobe and also a tv. You can sit on the bed and look out through the bifold doors and see the view over the beach. The balcony/terrace outside the lounge has teak chairs with foot stalls which you can slide together to make a sun lounger. We sat there in the evening sun and felt we could have been on holiday anywhere!

The room I had (room 3) was a bit on the small side but it was only me staying so not really and issue however if there were two of us then there may have been some issues. There was no desk area to work from and not really anywhere to sit apart from the bed. The bed was also so soft I sank in to it. I looked for a plug where the kettle was sited but there didn't seem to be a spare one so had to plug in over the other side of the room (using a bedside table) to make a cup of tea away from the beverage tray.

We had stayed at the Inglenook several times in many years ago and always enjoyed our time there. If anything the hotel has improved.

The room was small but immaculately clean with everything you would need. There is a basic but satisfying choice of cereals and yogurts, jams and marmalade and juices. The cooked breakfast options were plentiful, very well prepared and used top quality ingredients.

We did not eat in the restaurant on this occasion but it was always busy and the menu and specials looked wonderful. The Sunday lunch carvery look particularly delicious.

The bar was relaxed and friendly with an impressive variety of beers, ciders and specialised spirits. Despite the intermittent weather we were able to enjoy a couple of hours in the wonderfully maintained garden. It is easy to understand why this is a popular venue for functions

Upon opening the door the physical barrier of heat struck me like a Mike Tyson blow.
The curtains had been pulled, and the window had unfortunately been left open by whoever cleaned the room. This allowed it to become superheated, and the pedestal fan that had been left running at full pelt was vainly struggling to circulate the air. This produced the same effect of the a fan oven turned up to 10.
So I popped out after opening the window to the full 3 inches allowed by the security wires, to try cool the room.
Alas it was a vain hope, as the room took on the semblance of a Tennessee Prison sweatbox, and my night was reduced to a couple of hours of rolling from one puddle to another!

The welcoming booklet explains how the air conditioning system works, in a different hotel, with a different system. The control panel on the wall stated that this system could not cool the room.

All in all, I pity the poor cleaning lady that had to remove my sweat soaked sheets, pillows, and quite possibly mattress. Not an experience I shall want to repeat ever

I really hate negativity for its own sake so I shall try to be as fair as I can with this review. On the positive side the hotel is a nice old building with wonderful dark wood panelling throughout. There is a very pleasant garden with a water feature where you can enjoy a drink or just sit and take in the sun. The staff members are all very friendly and willing to help. The breakfast menu is very, very basic with little choice but is well cooked and local produce is used. We had dinner on our first night, the choice again was very limited but the food was perfectly adequate though not exciting. The small lounge /bar is comfortable but inadequate when non-residents are there in large numbers. This place is obviously very popular with locals and was always busy. There is a good-sized swimming pool but this was unusable during our stay. However, the building is in dire need of some TLC all the paintwork in the dining area is tatty and chipped. The décor and lighting in the dining room is bizarre and way over the top there are also two hideous life size soldier like figures standing guard at the restaurant entrance. All the paint work in the restaurant is chipped and dirty looking and In dire need of a lick of fresh paint. The garden is spoilt by life size facsimiles of a sheep and a cow again totally tasteless and unnecessary. Our bedroom was clean (definitely not exquisitely decorated) but in need of total redecoration; the weird pseudo French bed and furniture filled the rather small room making it hard to move around and all the drawers were small, shallow, hard to open and virtually useless. The bed was the most uncomfortable I have ever tried to sleep in being a wooden frame with a hard-thin mattress. The seating consisted of two uncomfortable and badly stained chairs. The bedside tables with glass tops and huge lights were useless as there was hardly any room on them for spectacles, a book or a glass of water. My wife said that the furniture was shabby chic and distressed, it looked more distraught to me. The bathroom was clean but needed painting and the shower had black mould on the lower tiles and outside below the doors. The metal taps, waste bin and plug were badly corroded. The towels were fabulous large and fluffy. The best and most comfortable part of the room was the outside terrace, a nice little suntrap the plastic chairs were comfortable and clean. This place needs an injection of cash to smarten up the whole tired appearance. Very sad as it is in a good position with some parking spaces and is very peaceful. The owners need to take a close look at the state of this place and do something about it for their own sake.

My 2 year old went into anaphylactic shock and an ambulance had to be called. At this point we were tried to be moved to a private room several times, my cynical side believes perhaps to move us out of the way. Whilst waiting for the ambulance we were also charged for the meal before being blue lighted to hospital and spending 12 hours there. The manager was meant to call us to see how my son was, they didn't. When we called them, they told us they are fully compliant with any laws as they had an allergy matrix, which at no point was given to us. They have promised to change the wording on the menus and that they are legally compliant but we will be making sure with further advice.
When I pointed out to the manager that taking payment was at least distasteful at that time as we were fully distracted they have just posted us details of receipts so we can check them - at which point they pointed out that the ice cream ordered wa dairy free (even tho the issue is with the cashew nuts)! they have also charged us for the icecream that had a bite taken and put my son in hospital. We feel we are fair and have raised points directly before writing any reviews but i just feel the lack of customer service and respect here has been appalling and I fear for what could have happened.

My wife (originally from the area) always wanted to stay here when she was growing up because of how ""posh"" it looked.

I booked a room with a double bed, shower and WC along with breakfast.

The hotel looks lovely from the outside, almost regal but the inside decor is a little ""tired"" to say the least.

There is an elevator so access to all floors is easy.

The room was rather disappointing it was clean and did have a sea-view but the room was very small and to get the ideal sea-view, you have to step onto the balcony which is via the window which also has a horizontal metal bar half way down which means that you either have to crouch or limbo to get outside.

I didn't check if there was a hair dryer in the room, but I'm sure one would be made available upon request at the front desk.

My wife fancied a nightcap upon return from our dinner. Although there was a sign on the bar stating that the ""bar was open"", no staff could be found, so we scratched that idea and just went to bed.

What is amazing is the Staff including Spencer’s the Butler who remembered us from 3 years ago. All of the staff go out of their way to provide a friendly good quality service. Our room was good and we were lucky to get a slightly larger balcony with a great view of the funfair. The food in the restaurant was also good and we had the dine around package which allowed us to visit all of the restaurants in the resort. The only thing I would say though is as a family of 5 with older boys 7, 10 & 13 I think we have outgrown the rooms now so we will have an apartment next time.

Check in was smooth and Caroline was very thorough going through our welcome pack and letting us know where things were etc. The room was lovely, brightly coloured, clean and fresh with a nice balcony, the towel animals were so sweet. The only minor downside I could find and it really is me being picky is that the kids room had no door on it but that being said, it didn't cause any issues by not being there. The bathroom was clean and functional and the shower was HEAVENLY. We got used to the (I think) water saving feature where the shower goes off intermittently and comes back on again. The main part of the bedroom was nice. Had two chairs and a table and tea/coffee facilities with full sized mugs. Being on the 5th floor we had a great view over the side of the park/Fairground. Breakfast at the Kaleidescope restaurant was again good but very very busy. Staff did a great job of replacing items as they got finished and cleaning and turning round dirty tables for other guests to sit down at. It seemed as though all of the staff in their respective departments were genuinely happy to work at Butlins. The pool was good but very busy. The kids enjoyed the water slides and splash zone.

I have to mention Louis in The Pub & Kitchen which I've reviewed separately, he was brilliant. And also the football coach, I think he had RS on his shirt who coached the kids football was just fantastic. He really engaged with the kids calling them footballers and with the parents as well. The three children in our group who played in the age 5-7 group were absolutely buzzing after they finished playing. Unfortunately due to a long drive back we couldn't get to the Sunday session too.

The only negatives we encountered really were that the fairground closes at 5 which we thought was quite early and that the pool changing rooms were filthy. The staff were doing their absolute best but Butlins should enforce a rule where people need to remove their outdoor shoes before entering the changing rooms as the dirt from the shoes mixed with water was gross. Not to mention the hair and fluff and whatever else was on the floor. Also, the hotel lifts must have a mention, they were soul destroyingly slow. We also got stuck for a few minutes in one on Saturday evening.

We went to check in around 1:30pm and even though there was a long queue and the staff must of been flustered, you wouldn’t of known as they all had a smile on their face. We were told our room wasn’t going to be ready until 3pm which wasn’t a problem as we just had a stroll around Butlins until then. They had however given us our welcome pack, our dine around tickets and our bands as well as anything else. We only had to wait for our room key cards.

We stayed on the 5th floor and had a double bed room with a kids twin bed room in it as well as a balcony. My parents stayed in the double room while my 22 month old son and I stayed in the kids room. This was our first time coming to Butlins, let alone staying in the Ocean Hotel and we were pleasantly surprised by the Hotel. The whole hotel - including the lifts - were clean and our room was spotless.
When we booked online, we stated that we wanted to hire a travel cot, which was kindly brought up to us by one of the Butlers, along with our luggage. Unfortunately, part of it was broken which you wouldn’t of known until you tried to click part of it into place, so the butler kindly made sure that we got a replacement brought to the room. The shared room included a bathroom with a toilet, sink, bath and shower. In the room there was also a table and 2 chairs, a kettle and tea/coffee making facilities (including x4 mugs and x2 teaspoons), a mini fridge, a full length mirror, a dressing table with mirror, and a tv in both rooms with working remotes. Although the mini fridge is what it says - a mini fridge, you can get quite a bit in their if you arrange things correctly. The room had AC which was perfect as the last 2-3 days of our stay the weather was really hot! Housekeeping came round to the rooms everyday and they would replace towels and toilet roll and empty the bins. They were also very respectful of not entering or knocking on the room of the “do not disturb” sign was on the door which it was one day which we really appreciated.

We only dined at the in hotel restaurant - the Kaleidoscope bar for the breakfast buffet which is open from 7:30am-10am. The staff greeted and seated you and were really lovely, and were so apologetic if there was little queue. It was nice to see that the tables were actually tables and not long dining tables like we had had at dinner in Papa Johns the night before. The tables were all laid out, as well as their being kids cutlery and the option for a kids bib if needed. The staff were also great at cleaning up, whether that was a table that hadn’t been cleaned before you were seated and had some crumbs on, or a spill on the floor, they were really efficient!

Food wise, there was so much to choose from and they really did cater to everyone. There was cold and hot food to choose from. The cold food included a variety of cereals (porridge too), some cold mears and cheese, fresh fruit (bananas, slices of melon or watermelon,and halves of grapefruit), as well as fruit pots, yoghurts and fruit pastries. The hot food section had everything you would need to create a fry up, which included black pudding as well as fried bread. As well as fried eggs, they also had scrambled eggs, poached eggs and hard boiled eggs. You had the option for toast pain au chocolat and croissants too, as well as pancakes! They even had an omelette counter where they would specifically make you an omelette to order if you asked. You had the option of getting yourself a hot drinking from the coffee machine that included tea and hot chocolate, as well as the fresh fruit juice machines, which had orange and apple as well as two other flavours. The variety was truly incredible! For under 2’s they even had the option to have x2 Ella’s Kitchen Pouches.

You usually have to check out by 10pm which gives you enough time to have breakfast, but they had the option of late checkout which meant you could stay until 12pm. We decided to pay for late checkout because a 22 month old toddler makes everything take twice as long which we had to pay £25 for, which we didn’t think was too bad.

We liked this hotel so much, that while at the Butlins resort, we decided to book again for the same time next year, making sure we stayed in the same hotel!

The resort looks very up-to date compared to minehead and Skegness. The funfair was very good as the rides are included, however I do think the go karts should be included as they were years before. The hall of mirrors and magic tricks area was very good for photos and a walk around.

We didn’t visit the swim pool as we booked to go to the spa instead however we are looking to return to be able to visit the new pool and the old pool does look dated and small.

We dined our at most of the restaurants while we were there, the diner was very reasonable and probably the best restaurant we went to, we had the buffet at papa johns this did work out quite expensive around £60 for the 4 of us

Our previous stay was in January 2019 in the Wave Hotel (Dolphin room – reviewed previously). This time we found a reasonable deal for a Reef apartment and wanted to try that since we love having extra space and a seating area.

We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment (double room plus a submarine bunk room) and loved it. The balcony was huge with a panoramic view across Bognor from several angles as it wrapped round part of the apartment, and included a sea view which could even be seen from the lounge sofa. The rooms are so funky and colourful. We were very happy and comfortable. The kitchen/lounge area had floor to ceiling windows including 2 patio doors (one in the kitchen area and one in the lounge). We were on the 6th floor, and whilst it was not the top floor, there was no apartment above us due to the staggered design of the section we were located in (I’m not sure if this would be the case for all apartments though). This was great as we detest having rooms above us as we always get disturbed by guests walking back and forth above. Not only that, but our room was at the end of a corridor and we didn’t hear anything at all from other guests coming and going late at night (on an adult weekend), so it was perfect. An added bonus was that both bedrooms have internal doors, so that’s another safeguard against any possible corridor noise. In this apartment the children’s bunk room was much wider than the narrow one we had in our hotel room previously but the door did not have a porthole in it. The entrance hall to the apartment is spacious. A surprise in the kitchen – which we nearly missed and I don’t recall seeing mention of on the website – was a sweet little dishwasher in what would normally be the bottom section of the oven. It was only because we’d been left a couple of dishwasher tablets that I started searching for it. After almost giving up, I eventually noticed the sticker on what looked like the bottom oven which said it was in fact a dishwasher (you can only wash or cook at one time – not both – but that was fine as we didn’t use the oven anyway). As well as 2 dishwasher tablets, a tea towel, washing up cloth, sponge scourer and a miniature washing up liquid was provided. The bath towels were of a decent size and we were glad to be given 2 key cards.

Everything was clean, the apartment had air con, and as already mentioned, great views (though I’m guessing possibly not all apartments would have such good sea views). We chose to spend a sunny evening with drinks on the balcony instead of going to the entertainment one night because it was so pleasant as the sun was setting … I could almost have been fooled into thinking I was abroad! The TV in the lounge had a built-in DVD player, as did the TVs in the bunk room and master bedroom. (I’ve included a photo of the input ports below the main TV in case anyone is interested in bringing and hooking up their own devices.)

If I was being very picky I’d say the TV in the lounge could have been bigger. It’s on a bracket in the kitchen area so you can pull it out and angle it to watch from the lounge, but it’s quite a distance from the TV to the sofa for the size of the TV. I think I saw the TV signal breaking up in the bunk room as I was loading a DVD, so beware that may not be reliable. The floor in the kitchen/lounge was very creaky. I also happened to notice that there was no mattress protector on the bunk beds, which was surprising. Otherwise everything was very good.

We so enjoyed the apartment that we unexpectedly booked to return. The apartments can be prohibitively expensive at certain times of the year for couples, so look for deals.

521,2140,1818,Bognor,5,"Very clean and good value Our first time at the Wave Hotel, and we stayed in a Dolphin room on the 6th floor. It was some years since we were last at Butlin’s but we used to enjoy staying in the Ocean Hotel (which wasn’t open on this break). We arrived at 1pm (the earliest arrival time for this weekend). Our paperwork said we could check in at 3pm, but we were actually told our room was ready and could go straight up, so that was a good start! The front car park by the security gate was already full at 1pm because they’d had a private conference and some of the delegates were still to leave, but there were plenty of spaces (at that time of day) in the car park between the other side of the hotel and the chalets.

The room was very clean and everything was in good decorative order. One small observation, which may be a little inconvenient for some, is that there's few surfaces to put your stuff on. With no dressing table or chest of drawers, there are just two small shelves (near the mirror and under the TV) to put bits and pieces on, but we managed OK. The fridge and tea making facilities were tucked away inside one of the cupboards.

I particularly liked the submarine themed kids den. It’s a very small and narrow room but cleverly designed with lots of small shelves to put things on and both bunks have TVs with DVD players. We were on an adult weekend and previous experience has taught us that sometimes it’s possible to be woken in the night on these breaks by one or two revellers, but the beauty of this hotel was that I could shut myself away in the kids room (bottom bunk) and not hear a thing from the corridor, as the bunk room had its own door which I discovered eliminates corridor noise. It was strangely comforting being tucked away in there, so for me a definite plus and a guarantee of an undisturbed night, though corridor noise disturbed someone in the main bedroom! Claustrophobics might not agree but I loved it. I’m sure it’s great for families as the parents can peep through the porthole to see if the kids are asleep without disturbing them.

We opted for room only (not being fans of food court dining and preferring to eat wherever we choose), so were looking forward to eating out at the other restaurants on site or in town. We had an enjoyable meal at Papa John’s, some fast food from BK, and a light lunch in the on-site pub (Beachcomber Inn) which was nice inside but the nachos were rather basic. Not all the restaurants were open on this break, so it was a shame we didn’t get to try the new Pub & Kitchen restaurant, which was closed for the entire break.

The brand new pool building and complex was due to open at Easter, so I’m sure will add to the appeal for families, and will tidy up an area which had previously been an eyesore.

Butlin’s really know how to do hotels in my opinion, with good room facilities (such as fridges, DVD players and kids dens) which you don't often get in hotels elsewhere. They are modern, colourful and have surprising funky twists. The lifts with their underwater decor and music always made me smile on the way up to the room!

573,2396,2136,Littlehampton,2,"Really very poor This is a rather belated review of our visit to the Sea View Pub/Hotel in East Preston on Easter Saturday, a few weeks ago. The review is in respect of the pub not the hotel itself – we live nearby so were just visiting for lunch and drinks.
It was our first visit and I have to say was disappointing in the extreme. We had in fact called in a few months previously after walking into East Preston and the barman had shown us the menu which included a fish platter (I can not remember the exact words or description).
However, when we arrived on Easter Saturday, we were told that with the exception of the plaice, they had no other fish at all (a fish platter was not on the menu but that is fair enough I guess as menus do change). We sat down with a drink and perused the menu and further disappointment arrived when we went to order.
As well as no “ordinary” fish they did not even have fish fingers for a sandwich and when I ordered ham was told “It’s still being cooked”.
We therefore settled on two x plaice and two x warm chicken and bacon salad.
It must be said that my wife and her brother who had the plaice described it as delicious (and that is the only thing that saved this from being a one star review). However the chicken and bacon salad were woefully lacking in either chicken or bacon!! Really poor.
With the exception of the barman (I think called Jamie) the rest of the people serving or hovering round the bar, who I think were the owners were all rather aloof and certainly not particularly welcoming.
To summarise, the two plaice meals were excellent, the service was not great and to have so many dishes unavailable at lunchtime on Easter Saturday is unforgivable (the pub was quiet at that stage so it was not because they had served lots before we arrived).
I can not comment on the hotel/bedrooms as we did not see them – I would add, however, that the stairway to the top of the building can be seen when accessing the toilets and the walls have peeling wallpaper and look distinctly unappealing.
As above, this really should be a one star review but the plaice meals meant I could not do that in all fairness.",exception barman think called jamie rest people serving hovering round bar think owner rather aloof certainly not particularly welcoming,jamie rest people,"['jamie', 'rest', 'people']",FamilyExp,0.0,neutral,

Ale was never the main reason for visiting this pub, but this time they had 4 brown bitters around 4%, which were all past their best. The meals were very home cooked rather than chef prepared. The sizes were generous enough which was good, but was very 1995. Its like we went back in time. Back to the future. To be fair, it was clean, the staff were keen and we were 20 years younger than anyone else in there so maybe they are focused on the over 70s. We will try again with my 76 year old mother and see what she thinks. Hopefully they might have at least one ale that isnt brown and thinner pastry on the pies.

The pub is in the centre of the village and a staff member kindly moved her car so we could park next to the disabled entrance. Our main courses were excellent and efficiently served. Unfortunately we then had a long wait for our desserts because a large party arrived in the meantime. Without this, we would have given the Lamb 5 stars. As it is, we are being a bit mean and giving them four. Of course, this sort of thing can happen, but we could have been better informed about the situation and might then have cancelled our dessert order.

Firstly the staff are brilliant! A lovely warm welcome but they don’t over fuss you, we were promptly shown to our room and left in peace to marvel at how beautiful it was. And yes our room was stunning!!! We were in the Charles Newman room and it was wonderful, beautiful little dressing room with a view over the square. Pretty little touches that made it perfect but with a spotless sleek modern bathroom.
After a walk around the village and some time in our room we headed down to the comfortable friendly bar, after a few drinks during which we enjoyed the music and the quaint features we eventually gave into temptation and looked at the menu.

I’ve eaten all over the world in a lot of five star restaurants but the quality of food and service we experienced here was second to none! My partner had.the steak medium rare, cooked to perfection! And I would have been jealous but my corn fed chicken was so soft and full of flavour that we barely spoke for five minutes because we were enjoying it all so much. For dessert may I strongly recommend the rhubarb sorbet and ginger cake, I wasn’t to sure when I saw it on the menu but after a staff member recommended it I thought I’d give it a go. The warmth and smoothness of the ginger cake contrasting with the sour rhubarb was gorgeous and I could have happily finished off my partners brownie aswell.

The serving and bar staff were amazing, friendly but not over the top and there conversation didn’t seem forced or fake. We slept very well and although you can hear a little shuffling in the morning from downstairs people need to understand it’s a beautiful old building and you can’t expect to stay in the middle of a village above a pub without any noise atall.

Breakfast was almost as good as dinner and served with a smile and plenty of option and our final bill was extremely reasonable.

A long review I know but I barely cover half the good points of this hidden gem, we are now booking a night there for my mum and we will be going back to see one of the other rooms x thank you to all the staff x",charles newman room wonderful beautiful little dressing room view square,room view square,"['room', 'view', 'square']",Room,0.0,neutral,

Our very first discovery of West Sussex brought us, Rika and Jan, to Arundel, not meant for the specific place, but by surfing the web and finding Nurses Cottage B&B in Warningcamp. Yes, we arrived late due to a disastrous traffic jam in Brighton, but Lizzie welcomed us warmly before we could leave the car.
What a room, what a stay! Castle view it was! And the garden!
Spotless room and living room, bright, good king size bed, personal ""à la carte"" breakfast every day on a table covered with a real ""Made by Paul"" route map: like a captain's cabin in a ship we could prepare our daily navigation while eating.
But the real captain is Lizzie, she has everything under control, the guests come first.
Every day we discovered small thoughtful details in the house: the right documentation on the right place, beautiful decorative elements, even binoculars (!) to enjoy the castle view even more, and so many other things that make Nurses Cottage a unique experience. Top! Thank you, Lizzie and Paul.

Lizzie’s lip-smacking breakfasts included, fresh fruit salad with home grown strawberries, eggs from their hens and family produced preserves. We were well entertained by watching the gymnastic activities of the squirrels and birds on the nearby feeders. That is, when not enjoying the same view that we had from our bedroom.

The large sitting room cum dining room was spacious and just the place to rest before venturing out in the evening.

Other reviews are from a local and provincial standpoint, or we have been fortunate to eat in many fine establishments.
David was very welcoming and attentive, but he was clearly struggling and running around in a role that encompassed Receptionist, Maitre D and Waiter - a clear lack of enough staff.
Restaurant quite nicely appointed, almost homely, but the state of the entrance & restaurant carpet was dirty, needs a professional clean, or replacing altogether. Some chairs in the main restaurant were badly scratched or torn, so have also seen better days, they urgently need covering, or also replacing.
The whole feel of the place was rather tired and dated.
Beef, Chicken were generally OK, nothing special, my wife was 100% sure the gravy was an instant mix, the potatoes and parsnips quite small, hard and tasteless. The plates were cold, good restaurant will always serve food on hot plated.
Tissues were offered as napkins - they should always be clean, white or black cloth in a good restaurant.
I called some days ahead and asked for a small cake to be ready for his Birthday, but instead a slice of chocolate cake was delivered with a ball of ice-cream, with a candle just stuck in both !

This pitch was on the right as you go down the track and as far back as you can go from the kids rope swing.

We truly loved almost everything about this site, clean showers, nice and quiet neighbours and all the other plus points previously mentioned in others posts.. But! There is considerable road noise.! We arrived on a Sunday and there is a race track not far away that didn't help but I think the bulk of what we were listening to was motor bikes on the A27?

It did quieten down pm but it woke me about 5am the following day. It sounds odd but if you pitch to the left of the path, closer to the road, it is quieter due I think to a hill that deflects the road noise.

Would I go back? Yip absolutely but I'd take an ear plug.

The accomodation is adjacent to the owners residence.There is car parking on site.

I dealt direct with Joanne for a last minute booking, and she was very helpful, accommodating my particular requests without difficulty. She was also very helpful when the whole town of Arundel (!) suffered a power cut one evening during my stay providing me with hot water for a drink and also battery lights. Luckily the outage only lasted 90 minutes and I amused myself for part of the time walking round moonlit streets with bored fellow Arundel residents.

I stayed in Calceto, which had all the facilities you would expect, including free wifi, fridge (with ice compartment), washing machine, cooker, microwave etc etc.

*Accommodation*
The barn itself is a beautiful conversion, full of character. I'd love to have it as my home! It was only completed at the end of 2018 and clearly no expense was spared. The shower is like something out of Star Trek! We stayed in the Rabbit and Hare room which is cosy but opens out on to a communal kitchen diner and mezzanine lounge. The other guests kept themselves to themselves so we essentially had all this space to ourselves. Of course, had the other guests decided to have a party late at night this might have been more of an issue.

*Service*
Susan and Robert, our hosts, couldn't have been friendlier or more welcoming. I'd originally booked just for me but my husband changed his mind at the last minute. Not a problem. I also needed breakfast / a packed lunch extremely early - again not a problem. Susan also popped over at 5.30am to check I had everything I needed.

*Other gems*
If you're hiking the South Downs way, the property is only 5 mins off the main trail and has a fully equipped kitchen for self catering. Otherwise, there is a lovely pub for dinner - The George and Dragon - only 5 mins walk from the property.

The property is dog friendly.

We had the Camembert as a sharing stater as we were ravenous, only complaint about this place was not enough bread....even though we were hungry 3 to 4 pieces were not enough and there was so much cheese left there should have been more bread to dip.
Other than that, loved the place and we were lucky with the weather, sitting on the veranda with the dogs....we have a 4 month old pup that we are training so we need to find good locations with other dogs.
Definitely recommend but can imagine it gets very busy during height of season and weekends.

Carol, our waitress at lunchtime couldn’t do enough for us so we decided to book for the evening as well, and we explained our dietary needs.

When we arrived for our evening meal Liz (our waitress), who had been there for seventeen years looked after us and Hannah, the manager was also on hand to make sure everything was ok.

They chef, who had been made aware of our dietary requirements had actually taken the time to prepare a special meal just for us based on our whole food plant-based diet.

This restaurant and its staff went above and beyond and we were humbled by their willingness to help and accommodate us.

The food was absolutely amazing.

So, if you are a vegetarian, vegan or on a whole-food plant-based diet I can highly recommend this restaurant.

They are friendly, caring and hugely customer-focussed.

More importantly, they are genuinely nice people.

We’ll definitely be back.

Thank you chefs, Carol, Hannah and Liz.

Large orders, no problem, diners going into restaurant. However, the single bar person gets overwhelmed with restaurant orders which obviously gets priority by the boss. Monica. Result: the queue builds. At a bar with no one behind it, as the singular barman is now a waiter for the restaurant. Next; similar problem with a twist. Wait 20 mins for service then the cash guy arrives just when it’s my turn. Single barman disappears for ten minutes. Not replaced. Then, I’m in luck. Ha! No one at bar. Single barman. Who is making ten coffees at a minute a time, with other drinks. He apologises. No problem with him or any other bar person. They work hard.

769,474,3103,Littlehampton,1,"Absolute Shocker wish I’d read the reviews Waited 7 mins to be greeted. I don’t time these things but I was looking at the time on my phone when we got in there. Think about that. 7 minutes standing there hoping someone would at least give us a nod, let alone approach us with an 82yr old and 2 small overheating thirsty girls. Totally unacceptable and I should have left then but the girls were hungry and it was my 82yr old mums birthday. What a treat she got, not.

When the server finally came over she sternly asked if we’d booked (as though it was unlikely we’d get a place)? It was 5:45pm, hello.

The restaurant was half empty by the way so id dread to think what it’s like when it’s busy. Unless you have the patience of a saint id avoid this place. I’ve come here on and off for years when invited by others and although the food has improved, it’s more expensive than it used to be but there’s always a problem either with hygiene, sticky tables, rude staff (not today though, they just didn’t get near us), poor supply to the salad bar, etc.

30 mins after being seated we were given no salad bowls but more importantly we were parched but STILL NO drinks on the hottest day of the year, so no rehydrating my 4 and 6 yr old in sweltering heat. 30 minutes after ordering with not even the jug of water that we ordered is unacceptable in that heat. When I finally had enough I wandered up and got my own jug at the bar. Intriguingly it had a big bite mark chunk out the side of the skanky worn out water jug. It should have been in the bin. Oh and they don’t have any ice on the hottest day in summer!!! Basil Faulty runs this place, surely?

No tomatoes or cucumbers in the salad bar just a watery mess where they once lived. Loads of sauces to choose from but it was a lucky dip as none were labelled running the risk of giving your child chilli sauce instead of ketchup or relish.

We ate the cut-down salad off little side plates as nobody gave us bowls so we improvised with what was there. My mum only had salad bar as she’s elderly so her whole meal was on a tiny side plate! Disgraceful.

After being left to fend for ourselves I cleared the finished salad plates myself in the end and put them on the tray I got from the bar when I went to serve myself and my family that jug of water.

As a side note I took my little one to the men’s bathroom. She’s kicked off her sandals under the table in the heat but I hadn’t realised. She then walked into the toilet and walked in urine leaking from the urinals. They had put out of a sign to say wet floor but it was puddles of wee all over the bathroom everywhere so my little princess had walked through lots of pee to get from the cubicle to the sinks, the poor little mite. It should have been mopped up or locked up.

Nobody asked how the food was, we weren’t offered any more drinks (not that they arrive anyway) despite it being sweltering. We didn’t get spoken to by anyone in that whole time since ordering food and due to the continued lack of staff I eventually had to go up and stand at the tills and interrupt a member of staff in order to actually pay the bill and get the hell out of there.

I noticed on the wall above the till it said something like “remember, no more bad reviews like the one from D.L” with a big arrow pointing towards it or something similar so it’s not as if they don’t know they need to buck up their ideas. To be fair the 2 people I encountered at the till were kind and apologetic. I wasn’t one of their tables but you could see they were frustrated and working under pressure in what seemed like a sinking ship so I did have sympathy for them. Very poorly managed though I’m afraid and lots of customers looked disgruntled. More staff and someone in maintenance to sort the bathroom, ice machine, I’ve cream machine is what’s needed.

The simple food took 45 minutes to arrive which is way too long in a half empty restaurant. Other restaurants set your expectations if there’s a long wait over 20 mins.
The food itself was ok when it arrived but I just wanted to get out of there by that point. I’d have to be desperate to go back there

773,490,3119,Littlehampton,2,"Take away very disappointing  Since we were unable to go out for a meal my sons decided to treat me to a Harvester take away for Father’s Day.

One of them placed the order online via the Harvester website at 7pm for collection at 9pm. One of my sons wanted the “Cowboy” burger but didn’t want bacon on it as he doesn’t eat pork, although you can “customise” your order there is no way to exclude an item, only change the sides. When confirming the order the site suggests phoning the restaurant if you want any changes. The site also advises that the details have been emailed.

After about 15 minutes I phoned the restaurant and said I wanted to modify an online takeaway order. The person who answered said he couldn’t find it on their system and since no email confirmation had been received yet I should call back when that had been received.

I rang back shortly after 8pm as I was concerned that we’d still not had email confirmation and since the phone wasn’t answered I left a voice message asking them to ring me.

Come time the order was due to be collected I was greeted well and the server went to bag up the order which only took a couple of minutes. I took the order home and my wife was dismayed to find that although she had ordered 2 jacket potatoes with her “Simply Chicken” these were not to be found but it appeared she had a portion of chips instead. She had also not received any gravy. Her vegetables were cold, not room temperature, actually cold.

We felt the portions were small considering the prices seemed pretty high.

We had ordered 4 desserts which were not to be found so I returned to the restaurant. The server (no name badge that I could see) was extremely apologetic and went to get the desserts.

The chef brought the desserts out and explained they need to be heated at home since if they were to heat them the plastic containers would melt. This should be made clear on the menu when ordering.

All the staff looked tired after what had probably been a long busy day but were still polite, helpful and friendly. That was the only redeeming feature as we felt the food was poor value and quality as was the accuracy of the order.

Waiters and waitresses were very attentive, friendly and helpful. Couldn’t have asked for more from them.

However- that’s all the positives out the way. For around £27 per person per head- I had a couple of pints of coke, nachos starter, Double stack burger, and crumble desert.

Nachos- were disgusting. Cheap quality. Disgusting fake cheese. Guacamole straight out of a jar and lumps of tomato dumped onto the plate (once it’s been nuked in a microwave). It was bland and tasteless... it’s so easy to make Guacamole & Salsa- why the hell is it not made fresh?! And the cheese... jeeze, use REAL cheese!!

The Double Stack Burger- was ok. Burger was burnt, but actually tasted average. Definitely had better burgers- but it was not bad. However- all my parties chips were brown, did not taste or look fresh and were basically ‘just about’ warm... so pretty pathetic in reflection.

The Apple & Berry Crumble was a huge disappointment. Again heating of the custard seems to be an issue- barely warm it was. The crumble topping was nice- the rest was more like a soup. Pretty awful!!

I got there early and sat down with a pint, looked very nice and I waited in a seat being watched by an old man with a drink he hadn't touched, he didn't take his eyes off me, thought he was actually dead sitting up.
Had my drink and decided to grab the table we had pre-booked. The staff member I dealt with was actually very nice. Anyway, my partner and our friend arrived and we all sat down with toddler and had a nose at the menu. Food sounded amazing and the price was fair.
So we went in and ordered.
Our starter was nice and I had a feeling we would have a nice time.
Until we wanted our mains. After an hour and a half wait I went back in and asked if our mains were ready, oh yes they'll be out soon. Bear in mind we had a toddler with us who wanted dinner!
Not 5 minutes later the food comes out. My partners dish was lukewarm at best. My friends steak was cooked wrong and her salad was brown and curling. My steak was also cooked totally wrong. Luckily the toddler had a good meal. So I took the steaks back (my partner was so hungry at this point she had to eat something) and complained. A half arsed apology was given and 2 more were cooked, again, totally wrong. I again went in to complain that the order was wrong and again food was sent back out. The steak I received was still cooked wrong but at this point I was starving and had to eat something. My friends steak looked better, but there was almost no meat in the steak, the cut was all grissle and bland. It was also cold. Oh, and the peas that came on the plate had freezer burn and were disgusting. The meal was an absolute disaster. Went back in and got a full refund for the meal.

Typically you can't go wrong with italian food for a little one and Parpadelle looked cosy yet casual from the outside. It turns out the menu downstairs is different from upstairs (I didn't realise there was an upstairs until later in the meal). I ordered a kids margherita pizza and moule frites

The kids pizza came up. The base was flavourless and undercooked and it was smothered in cheese and covered with herbs and rocket salad. Fine for an adult. Not fine for a fussy 3 year old.

The mussels were worse. I ordered it with chips but was offered bread as there was plenty of sauce. I said yes to this but then turned out it was bread OR chips so never received the chips. It didn't matter in any case as the mussels hadn't been washed and I after 4-5 mouthfuls of grit and sand I gave up and sent it back and picked at the equally inedible pizza.

On the upside the service was friendly. The waitress did apologise and said she would tell the chef / not charge for the mussels which was fine.

853,836,3675,Bognor,2,"Terrible Service We stayed at the attached Premier Inn, having been in the area attending a 21st birthday lunch, so the Robin Hood was the obvious choice for a light bite that evening.

We opted to have just sharer starters and dessert, but were there for two hours because the service was so slow - you would guess because it was a Saturday evening and therefore busy, but it was not and there were lots of empty tables (which surprised us because we'd booked a table online several days before and could only get 1815 or 2000, so had assumed everything else in between was already reserved).

However, the worst part for us was when we ordered a 0% Kopparberg cider for our 17 year old daughter mid-way through our visit. This was brought over by someone other than the waitress we'd placed the order with, and he immediately asked our daughter for ID. We questioned him and stated that it was a NO-Alcohol drink, assuming he hadn't realised that it wasn't a 'normal cider'; but he insisted on knowing their age stating that it still came under the same alcohol regulations - to which we advised him she was 17. He then said 'that's fine because even it was alcoholic there is no problem, as they could still be bought an alcoholic drink by an adult when eating in a restaurant' - by which time we really couldn't see the point in the whole conversation.....!!

Unfortunately, the episode had upset both our children, and our daughter left the restaurant after the starter not wanting to stay any longer and have a dessert. Our 12 year old son was absolutely stunned by the questioning, and kept repeating 'I don't understand, it was NO-Alcohol'.

We had no issue with the food served, but the service was appallingly slow - and the unnecessary questioning over what was essentially a mixed fruit squash left us all dumbfounded.

(For clarification, we looked into the ID issue after we left, and law only states that under 18's cannot buy or be served alcohol that has a content of 0.5% or more - this 'cider' was 0%, zero, nothing, null, nil - with the exception of a licenced premises serving food when a 16 or 17 year can then be bought an alcoholic beverage by an adult).

The only saving grace really was that we had a Tesco Clubcard voucher to cover the cost of the food, otherwise we would probably have left long before any of it was even served. Our bill left to pay came to a little over £11.00, but we were paying cash so ended up leaving the waitress with a £20 note and telling her to keep the change - as we dared not waste any more of our time waiting for her to come back with it!!

Lunch was lovely, 3 burgers and 1 vegan burger with two Camembert starters.

A couple of things to improve on:
1. I had a large glass of wine which appeared not to have been cooled at all. I think the better option for the server would have been to advise that that bottle was not cold and did I want another option. Room temperature white wine... meh. (to be fair, I did not tell the staff - so no replacement was requested/given)
2. My husband wanted the cheesecake - nope! none of that left. Then he changed to the brownie - nope! none of that either. That's ok, we'll have a lovely after lunch coffee - nope! The coffee machine is broken. We weren't presented with any alternatives like - can we get you a cup of tea on the house???

It was nice and fresh inside and appeared to be more of a restaurant than a pub with most tables either reserved or laid out for eating. Outside it was exactly the same as it has always been - 6 or so rickety old benches, no umbrellas and traffic to and from the car park going past. Not an easy place to eat on a hot day if you hadn't reserved a table inside so forward planning is needed!

The food was fine, but as other reviewers have commented pricey for what it was.

Staff were harassed and hurried and completely ignored the bar in favour of the restaurant duties for up to 10 minutes at a time. There was no acknowledgement of your presence at the bar. There was generally a tense atmosphere inside with staff crashing about - I would guess management is either poor or ineffective as there did seem to be plenty of staff on duty.

The George is a nice looking pub in a good location and may well be better on a quieter day.

If you want a walk along the river from Arundel then try going on the other side to the Black Rabbit - it is popular but there is a good reason for that - Plenty of shaded seating in a fantastic location on the river, friendly efficient staff and good pub food at decent prices.

945,1183,4162,Bognor,1,"Amazing food, worst service ever Let me start by congratulating the chefs at Cardamon Bay tonight for producing absolutely wonderful looking and tasting food, in a very timely manner from when our order was taken, despite a busy Mother's Day service.
However, I can only rate our experience as 1 for the following reasons:
We waited ages to order our food, and eventually had to rather obviously flag someone down.
When I was deliberating over a suitable vegetable dish for my children, I was basically told by a waiter to hurry up because he had other orders to take; it was said in the nicest possible way so I just assumed that he was feeling pressurised and thought no more of it.
However the rudeness continued. When my husband ordered a drink when the food arrived, we were left with no drinks at all until the end of the meal, my older children were sharing out the baby's drink, and my husband was gesturing to the manager at the bar, who kept looking up, then looking away. I managed to catch another member of staff, but after my first sentence, she asked me to ""wait one minute"", ran off, and we couldn't catch another member of staff for at least 5-10 minutes. The member of staff who did eventually take our drinks order was then rude to my husband.
There was also a small incident while we were there. A member of staff accidentally dropped a glass container/bottle which shattered very near a sleeping baby in a carrier, near our table and right next to another customer. The manager asked everyone nearby not to move while they cleaned up, and then proceeded to loudly berate the waitress in her mother tongue, until he noticed people looking and promptly became nicey nicey.
Overall it appeared that members of staff had been given roles that they were not allowed to deviate from despite the obvious need for multitasking and this was unchecked, some members of waiting staff were rude and under pressure and this was unchecked, some front of house staff may not have had the language skills necessary for interaction with and service of customers especially during a busy service, the manager showed very poor form in his treatment of his staff member who had had the accident with glass and he was commanding to my husband when we entirely decided to cancel our second drinks order and pay the bill at the door on exit whilst explaining why we were so disappointed with our experience.
Such a shame. The kitchen team handled the busy service and turned out some gorgeous food, but it was an epic fail for the front of house team led (or not) by their manager.

What arrived was a large plate of the items described and everything battered and fried plus a serving of very tired looking fried chips.

Ok I was stupid ordering a completely ridiculous fried selection and badly balanced meal but it begs the question why was it on the menu in the first place?

Far too many items on the menu, so hardly surprising they're poorly executed. Prawn cocktail with peppers and celery in it to bulk it out, ewww, probably why they think they can charge ridiculous prices, just for being pretentious.

The roast beef lunch wasn't worth £5 (it was nearly £15). The meat was OK but it certainly didn't melt in the mouth, took a fair bit of knife work to cut up unfortunately. The gravy was bland, tasted like dishwater. The roast potatoes were advertised as being in beef dripping, they definitely weren't! I do roast potatoes in beef dripping every time I cook a roast, they crisp up nicely and have great flavour, these potatoes were really bland and tasteless, not even seasoned.

The Yorkshire pudding was OK, but tasted strangely sweet, like it was cooked using honey (would have been great for a dessert with ice cream and maple syrup topping but) not great with a savoury roast. Worst of all were the vegetables! I like mine Al dente, these were practically raw! Seems like they were heated up in boiling water but then served before they were cooked. No horseradish or mustard offered at any point.

As I popped to the ladies loo I couldn't but help notice a lot of plates which had contained roast dinners were left on tables with lots of veg still on them. Shame none of the waiting staff mentioned the undercooked veg to the cook.

We received 2 check backs within a minute of each other, both less than 2 minutes before we finished trying to eat our food, so certainly not worth wasting time pointing out how awful the food was.

The cook obviously doesn't taste what he/she serves to customers, pretty sure if the food was tasted anyone worth their salt wouldn't have the nerve to hand it to customers and actually charge for it. I wouldn't eat here again if it was free! I value my taste buds and stomach.

It was an impressive plate of food with good portions, and looked great till i tucked in. The veg was undercooked and cold, the nut roast was pale and very bland tasting, and nothing like a nut roast i have ever had before. I asked for some more gravy, and what turned up was the worst gravy i have ever tasted. It was the right colour. but had no taste at all, and was just awful. I tried to eat some of it, but gave up, as it was so cold and tasteless. Other people at the table also said the food was very bland and cold.

I rarely complain about food, but on this occasion, I returned the food, and was given a full refund. It has put me off returning there again.

We were allocated a pleasant table but constantly in my sightline were two ladders on the wall behind my dining companion so all the rungs were strangely affecting my eyesight as I chatted...I don't think it was the wine so I will avoid that particular table in future. The radiators were throwing out a good amount of heat on a cold January evening and the restaurant was reasonably busy so good ambiance. We were in the restaurant part where all orders are taken at the table so no longer do you have to go to the counter to place orders for drinks and food with your table number so a big improvement to previous.

Extensive menu with a number of more exciting dishes in addition to pub classics, good portions, and some interesting ""healthy"" vegetables on several main dishes, not just chips and peas. Reasonable choice of wines by the glass and other drinks, teas and coffees to finish. Good range of both Salcombe dairy ice creams and a choice also of non dairy ices which you don't see so often.

Good service from very well trained young staff, competent and proficient although slightly mechanical. There was a delay in our second round of coffees appearing and this was picked up on by the serving staff who apologised for the wait. Most efficient.

Overall very good value, would not consider it at all pricey in comparison with other establishments in rural West Sussex.

I waited a few minutes to be served at the bar, and asked if it would be ok to eat in the garden as I was confused why there was a sign saying that food was only served on the small terrace - why would we want to sit there, crowded with nasty metal tables, when there's a beautiful pub garden to enjoy? The lady behind the bar asked if I had made a reservation, to which I had replied that I hadn't. I was then told, very firmly, that those who had booked got priority.

Having read recent reviews about the food and experience we were optimistic that we'd have a local restaurant to add to our regular places to go for a sunday lunch. Admittedly we hadn't booked, but our general experience with the local pubs is that you dont need to but you may need to wait for food which is totally fine with us.
We arrived at 1.15pm to find there were 2 tables with shade available in the garden. Brilliant! We went into the bar area to ask whether we could have a menu (there's only waitress service inside and not outside, which was fine) The young lady that was behind the bar had stated there would be a 30 minute wait for food which we had said was totally fine. We were happy to wait for food whilst we had drinks. If I'm honest the way she responded made us feel like we had put her nose out of joint that we'd even asked about food. She then repeated that there would be a 30 minute wait... to which I said that was fine. She seemed surprised it was ok. But in all honesty I was happy we had found somewhere that we could get a table at without booking. I asked my partner whether he picked up on the frostyness and he completely agreed. Anyway after shaking it off, we got our toddler settled into the high chair and chose our food. Only to find that when we then went back into the bar to order food and drinks that the young lady said we couldn't order until 30 minutes time! It is the most absurd thing I have ever heard in terms of a service!! I completely understand that you may need to wait after ordering.... but to have to wait to ORDER.... is baffling! She was so abrupt I was so taken back. The most frustrating part of this was that the manager was not interested in even facing us to speak to us. We were not worthy of her attention. In fact I'm not sure if anyone was. I am gutted because it has potential to be great. No matter how good food is, Service is key and there's no point having staff that dont have any customer service skills. I am disgusted at how we were spoken to.

The irony is that we headed up to the Village Inn, they were just as busy as the black horse. We got the last table in the garden, we ordered, the staff so friendly and our food was on the table all within 15 minutes.

The decor is cosy and welcoming, the food plentiful, they were flexible, well staffed and courteous. It’s also so close to the Crematorium that it was easy and convenient for friends and family alike.

The landlady, Jen gave us a personal service, taking the time to show us how part of the pub would be reserved and advised dad on the numbers to cater for. Jen was sensitive to our needs and offered a lot of flexibility in the menu options. On the day, the turnout was much bigger than we had expected and originally catered for, but the pub managed seamlessly.

Even the weather proved a test, with a heavy shower and sunshine. With the layout, we were able to be accommodated inside and then, as the sun broke through, we could spill out into the front garden. The kids were also looked after, because Jen opened the skittle alley, which kept them amused, while we chatted.

A funeral is a time of great stress, but Jen and the team at The Black Horse were absolutely first-class. Our guests had a great time, we reminisced, shared stories, laughed and cried and gave mum a send-off of which she would have been proud.

If anything we thought the food was better than last year with the lamb roast at £13.95 being on the top end of pub prices but very enjoyable. We did have to choose our menu in advance which is takes a bit of sorting out but then each couple simply went to the bar and paid for the two meals while ordering their drinks.

The outlook from the pub terrace is onto the road, but it is sstill quiet and surrounded by lovely buildings. Coupled with this the publicans have done a great job with flowers, so it still had a great feel.

The sun finally disappeared behind a tree at 8pm, and we went inside. And again we greated to a surprising interior. Far more modern than I was expecting, but still felt inviting.

The food was great, but beware... prices are relatively high, but as long as you know this beforehand you will not be shocked at the bill (I have included the current menu within pictures to give you a flavour of what is on offer and the cost).

We had a sharing fish platter to start, followed by steak, and both were a treat.

The seafood platter (£19) would have been quite enough for my husband, myself and my daughter if we had ordered a couple of portions of chips though!

The food is so varied - burgers and other mains you may as well go elsewhere because it’s better value for money for the quality.

Staff weren’t the passionate exciting staff I’m used to in other “tapas” USP bars. They looked bored.

The catchment market and the people that go there don’t match the atmosphere, the housy style music for the “entitled” youngsters that feel they’re important in there doesn’t equate the the clientele that sit there in the day paying for over priced coffee like costa.

Considering I’m never in the UK but this place is an example of why I hate being here so much and rather travel to authentic real places - won’t be returning any time soon, weird atmosphere, weird concept and the clientele ruin the place.

A real Spanish tapas and wine bar would be a great catch in Rustington - the clientele is there for it - just seems like the leakage from the lamb down the other end has come here for a “exquisite” setting

Good points however,
Layout, open spread out and comfortable
Great seating, felt cosy and warm
Cocktails excellent

The food isn't amazing, but you could get some simple tapas and enjoy a glass of wine and have a good evening. I don't know if the chefs have changed or if it simply depends who is working that night, but the quality of the food varies from visit to visit.

I note the management have made a previous comment that they are trying to get staff to wipe up. Please give them and apron with front pockets to carry a spray, cloth and wipes so they have no excuse not to think that if they pick up a glass they can clean at the same time so the next customer gets a seat at a clean table.

First impressions were of somewhere done up, this can be a warning bell for me and another was the bill for the cheapest fixed menu lunch (2 courses), around £56 for two with one drink each. Anyway I managed to maintain the requisite stiff upper lip. And the interiors were actually quite nice. The welcome I would describe as polite rather than warm; then again, maybe we were a bit on the scruffy side!

Food came in reasonable time and was presented quasi nouvelle style, not something I usually particularly favour, but this was done nicely and nothing too fussy.

We really began to warm to the place on tasting the food, which was excellent throughout. My starter of mackerel Caesar salad was really fresh (...& that certainly tells with mackerel), with the anchovies done whitebait style and salty lardons. Mains of sea bass included a generous size whole fish each, cooked to absolute perfection with just the right touch of garlic, a few new potatoes and a delicious side salad.

However I had the set menu and I did at the time comment to my dinner companions as to how long they could keep it at the very good price level it was.
I was not going to write a review, and am still not going to. But would like to comment on the review about the set menu prices going up 12%. The reply by the owners was clear and distinct and put the case very well. However it did miss one very salient point that all restaurants, pubs etc have to cope with on top of rising food prices, utility prices, business rates etc. That is that we tend to forget, as it is included normally in the price in the UK that 20% of what you pay goes to the government in VAT. So if you have the set meal at £22.95 then £4.59 is going straight to the government. Yes you can claim VAT back but in the restaurant business very little ! am told. We have one of the highest VAT rates in Europe for hospitality.
I am not a regular visitor to Bognor Regis but one of the things that you do notice as opposed to some of the dare I say it 'posher' places is the lack of restaurant chains.
If you have independents whether they be restaurants, bars, pubs, cafes or any business you should use them or lose them!
Business is incredibly tough at the moment and if you still think Mars Bars are 10p or you can get a well cooked three course meal for less than £20 well you are about 10 years behind the times.

1247,2632,6207,Bognor,3,"Good food but ........ First the positives: really good food (calves liver, boeuf bourguignon, and lemon brulee); service was also good - very prompt and polite; nice colour scheme.

Now the negatives: sounds like a cafeteria - needed more soft furnishings to tone the noise level down; two tables (or 1 table of 4) too many - as people walked through they were knocking things off other tables or seated customers had to move their chairs; you can't add a tip to a card payment - not everyone carries cash so the staff will lose out with this.

Finally, this restaurant has promise as the fundamental aspect (the food) is good, it is just the environment that lets it down. The choice of colours is lovely but the paint is already scuffed in places, the door to the toilet corridor barely opens and the toilet area itself is not brilliant (stains on walls etc.). They have tried to do a classy look but on a tight budget, and it shows.

Hopefully if the food stays good then they can make enough profit to afford to improve the environmental issues and add wallpaper & curtains - both of which will stop the sound bouncing around the restaurant. And they need to sort out the tipping mechanism otherwise their staff will miss out on rewards for good service.",,tone noise level,"['tone', 'noise', 'level']",Service,0.0,neutral,negative sound like cafeteria needed soft furnishing tone noise level two table table many people walked knocking thing table seated customer move chair not add tip card payment not everyone carry cash staff lose

It was very busy which is always a good sign but we found somewhere to sit overlooking the River Arun. We were given menus very quickly and ordered drinks while we looked at the menu. The couple behind us were eating roast dinners which looked and smelt amazing but unfortunately we’d arrived late in the day and the roasts had all sold out. We ordered 2 crab sandwiches from a lovely lady called Sharyn instead and waited eagerly for our food. Some moments later Sharyn came back to our table and informed us there was some roast potatoes left over and asked if we would like them! What fantastic service! Our crab sandwiches were made and brought out promptly - beautifully presented with crisps and a side salad, along with some wonderfully fluffy piping hot crispy roast potatoes! Cracking!

As always we tend to look for a different place to visit when roaming for something to eat and do some country driving at the same time. A quick look on TA highlighted Partners as a very good place to visit so we thought, why not! We weren't disappointed, managed to find a parking spot right outside, got a nice comfortable table that became available just as we walked in and greeted by staff within a minute of arriving. The decor has a very personal touch to it with authentic low beams and varying levels, tall people (like me) mind your noddle!

The menu is plentiful and quite varied but this time we went for the set breakfasts. Our order was taken and advised that it may take a little longer to serve the food due to the sudden influx of customers. Despite that, after ordering (and having the order checked that we had all options available) the food arrived within 5 minutes and was plentiful, hot, very tasty and quite frankly superb. An additional drink was ordered whilst eating and that arrived with a few minutes as well (marshmallow & cream hot chocolate, the boss said they were outstanding (and had two!)).

To summarise, Partners is well well worth a visit if you're in Arundel, you might not be as lucky as we were in parking and getting a table so quick but I can assure you any wait would be worthwhile. They do have a few breakfast bar type seats and a very comprehensive takeaway menu as well for on the go food. And if you want to pass the time there are dominos and solitaire sets available.

Looking forward to visiting again very soon and couple it with some ale tasting from the Arundel Brewery for a relaxing day out. Cheers!",,partner good place visit,"['partner', 'place', 'visit']",VisitExp,0.4404,positive,quick look ta highlighted partner good place visit thought not

1321,3081,6945,Bognor,3,"Disappointing customer service My husband and I went to Fino a few weeks ago, on the recommendation of my parents, who live in the area. It was the first time we had left our new baby for an evening out together so we wanted to go somewhere nice to mark the occasion.

1. Staff were friendly and the food was generally good. However, my husband ordered the beef, medium rare, and it came very well done. We didn't want to make a fuss but we thought it worth saying something to the waitress, especially as the beef cost about £28. The waitress apologised and explained that they would redo the beef. Unfortunately, despite eating very slowly, I had finished my meal long before the replacement arrived for my husband. A number of staff apologised for the delay, but nothing more was done. My husband ordered another glass of wine and the waitress said that this would be on the house, which was nice, but by then I had already finished my meal and my husband had to eat alone. The beef was good, but not amazing. The portion of tomatoes on his replacement meal was much smaller. The chips were replaced but the side of beans that my husband had ordered and had put onto his plate were not replaced. We didn't want to spoil the evening and so didn't say anything but we thought that a reduction might have been applied to the bill given the delay. At the end of the meal, there was no discount to the bill which came to over £70 for two mains, one side, one pudding and two glasses of wine. We found this disappointing.
2. My parents felt disappointed as they had recommended the restaurant to us and my mum went in a few days later to express her disappointment at the situation. She was told that it was standard to simply replace the meal if something was wrong and was told that she would receive a call from the manager. She left her contact details but has heard nothing since.
3. A shame as it wouldn't have cost them much to offer a small token by way of apology or to at least have called when they said they would.

This place is noisy beyond tolerance. Bare white plastered walls, no tableclohs and music blaring in the restaurant from the bar. It is noisy with absolutely no ambience. It is impossible to have a conversation without shouting accross the tightly packed tables. I have had quieter meals in burger chains on kids birthdays.
Yes on arrival we were greeted at the door and ushered to our table whereupon we were asked if we wanted to order wine before we had sat down. very pushy.
Instantly had the feeling of being ""processed"" not welcomed.
A waitress brought menu's and again asked if we wanted to order wine before we had seen the drinks menu. We declined saying we would choose drinks to go with our meal.
She returned and asked again!
Eventually we ordered. First we got Bruscetta as one dish which was a whole pannini with vey little strips of pepper and beetroot with 1 tiny anchovy, I had 3 of the smallest sardines you have ever seen.
On complaint we were told that this was the chef's interpretaion of what a Bruscetta might be......not an actual bruscetta (and nothing like that shown on their web site)
For mains we had a sea trout fillet (average but not special) and I ordered the Chicken breast with pancetta and crushed new potatoes and""greens"". What I got was a minute chicken breast About 1/3 supermarket size with two very small new potatoes and some long strands of green vegitables that I can only deduce to be cabbage. I could not tell. There was no pancetta but there was a hard brown golf ball size lump of something that i assumed was the stuffing. it was inedble.
A waitress asked if the meal was ok but did not pause for a reply so I called her back. I complained about my meal and our accompanying garlic ciabatta that was again just pannini . She was happy to stand and argue with me her main defences being that 1. they had never had complaints before and 2. the ciabatta is what their supplier sends them ( does their chef not order his supplies? or is it a case of anything will do for the punters?)
They took my meal away and replaced it with what was described as ""veal Milanese. I could go on for hours but by now I had lost faith that they new anything about what they were serving up. There were breadcrumbs (not parmesan) over cooked and burnt around the edes covering some tough, tasteless, dark brown meat. I have never seen veal that colour before.
We ordered coffee and left.
This was supposed to be a nice meal out to celebrate our wedding aniversary. It was a thow back to the 1970's. poor menu, poorly cooked food, over attentive ""pushy"" service
 and poor surroundings. I have had better meals in the works canteen

We all ordered different mains including the fillet which was cooked perfectly with home made chunky fries, the trout again perfect with skinny fries and I honestly forget the 3rd dish but again my friend said it was amazing.

It wasn't but rather than complain on what was suppose to a celibration of 28 years of marriage, we perceivered. The steak was dry and over powered by the truffle oil which totally ruined it. After about 3/4 of the steak I gave up as did my wife. The so called Grosse Fries looked like they'd come from a Macains frozen bag and were anything but Grosse. When the proprieter asked how it was I replied ""do you want the truth2 and she said yes. I was somewhat supprised we she said there wasn't truffle oil on the dish! My taste buds and the other staff said differently. We were given a Lemoncello as a concellation, didn't enjoy that much either. We should've complained much sooner but as I said this was our aniversary and quite frankly if you can't cook a fillet steak you shouldn't be working in a kitchen especially one that costs £27.50.

For mains we had the crab risotto, a pizza, and the breaded chicken, with egg and chips. Desert just had one chocolate tart with the mascapone. Came to around 100 pounds with drinks.

Restaurant was really nice and clean, nice lighting and general ambiance. Toilets nice and clean and modern. Staff were friendly and nice. Trying to do a fair honest review so its actually meaningful and constructive.

Drinks order was done reasonably quickly. Took a perhaps a while to place our food order, not long enough that it was bad, but just a bit too long. After order was made food came out in good time, with about the right gap between starter and main.

Starter. The seafood platter, tasted reasonably good. Breaded whitebait, and calamari in a bowl with some tartar style source. It was ok. decent. the seafood perhaps lacked the wow factor, but it was not bad. tasted reasonably fresh. just needed perhaps some more flavours or choice of dips. the crab bruschetta. Was a bit disapointing. Again not really bad. But the bread (panninni or something) was just a bit soft and tasteless, the crab layer didnt really have much flavour, it was just a bit bland. Not like really tasty, hard to describe. but not bad. not unpleasent.

The mains. The pizza which was just cheese and tomato. The quality of the pizza base was nice, and sort of seemed like good fresh dough. the cheese and tomato sauce had a good fresh flavor. but it lacked real flavor beyond just tomato and cheese was generally a bit bland (not a major problem for the kids menu). Also the bottem of the pizza had little black bits on it. the base was not burnt, but it had little black bits from where it sat in the oven, and these sort of gave a strong bitter charcoal flavor which was the overwhelming taste.

The crab risotto. This looked good, the texture of the risotto was good. But it had a really strong, overpowering flavor of aniseed? or something like this, maybe fennel. First spoon you notice it and you can not really taste anything else. But it became a bit sickly quickly. Again its was not really bad. but it was not great.

The Bread crumb chicken with a fried egg on top and chips. The chicken tasted fresh, the bread crumbs were fresh, it was hand made. It was not dry. the bread crumbs where a little bit greasy. and theres was no other real flavour going on apart from the chicken. but I thought it was pretty good. Fried egg on top. Fine. chips were good too. It just felt a bit like the sort of thing I make at home, tasty but a bit bland perhaps. I also thought the truffle source was properly vile, so glad it was in a little jar on its own it would have ruined the meal. but everyone else thought it was delicious and stole it :) thats a personal taste thing i think.

Desert. The chochlate tarte with mascapone, with little chocholate sticks in it. the flavour was great. the nice creamy mascapone, with sweet chocolate sticks. However the chocolate tart was bullet hard, I literally could not break it with a ton of force, it was so tough and when it broke it would shatter and fly off the plate. perhaps needed more balance was a lot of mascapone with just a very thin tart. but it tasted really nice.

Thats it. Im trying to be really honest. Would we go back. Yes. I think the restaurant has good intentions and is trying to serve good food and it felt nice in there, and we had a good time.

The Aperol Spritz despite instructions on the back of every bottle was terrible the recommended 3 parts prosecco, 2 parts aperol and 1 part soda included at least 10 parts soda if any prosecco at all.
The rump steak was not rare as requested but well done and chewy but the worst was the under-cooked fish on the point of raw, concealed within a wrap of pancetta. This any chef will know is very dangerous and can lead to anisakiasis a parasitic disease caused by anisakid nematodes(worms) invading the stomach wall of humans. Offering to cook it again or replace it with something else just doesn't cut it when you are already beginning to doubt the ability of the establishment.
The waitress offered to replace the Aperol Spritz and took it off the bill. The fish course was also deducted but they left the uneaten fries on £3.

So half eaten steak and half bottle of wine consumed whilst waiting ad nauseum for food is a lousy way of spending an anniversary or any other celebration so I would recommend finding somewhere else that genuinely cares about quality.

The food was delicious, generous portions and obviously homemade - we had the lamb shank, the steak and ale pie, dauphinois potatoes and loads of fresh vegetables. Everything was of a high standard. Roast was on offer if we’d wanted it.
Puddings were also homemade which I hadn’t expected ordering sticky toffee pudding. It was as light as a feather and sinfully sticky and my partner’s frangipani tart was also good.

The floor staff were always kind and willing to go the extra mile to ensure we had a good visit, which is surprising considering how the management always spoke to them and treated them in front of customers. As someone who has owned their own business, I would never think to speak or treat staff the way they do. The only familiar faces we encountered last Saturday was a young lad and brown haired woman behind the bar, who are both always smiling and polite. The new staff( a blonde girl) let the other members of staff do all the work, whilst she stood at the end of the bar talking to a male and female who she obviously knew. Me and my family noticed a few visits ago just how colicky this pub is, either you’re art of it and you matter or you’re not part of it and you don’t matter. This isn’t how a pub should be run, everyone should be made to feel welcome.

We weren’t entirely sure what to expect food wise, as in the past, I have found American diner style restaurants to be a bit hit and miss. We were served quickly to a nice booth, where the table and booth were nice and clean and laid out. If you got an American Diner i feel it is a must to see if they’re milkshakes are any good. I went for a strawberry milkshake which is made with 4 scoops of ice cream. It was DIVINE. It looked incredible and tasted even better! I really liked the fact that they make it to order as well because they state that it is made with 4 scoops of ice cream, they bring you over in a metal cup whatever is left over - not that I drank any left overs as it was very filling

I made my own burger (one of the options they have) which had crispy chicken, bacon and lettuce in it. It was really delicious and if you like chicken burgers, I recommend you try this or something similar.
My mum, who is a vegetarian ordered one of their Veggie Mountain which is a vegetarian burger that I’m pretty certain included halloumi and mushroom. It was absolutely huge but she said that it was delicious and she would recommend it to anyone going for a veggie option.
My dad went for New York Strip (pretty certajn) which was cooked how he liked - rare and loved too.
All meals came with chips, although I changed mine to sweet potato chips - can never go wrong with chips! Plus, these chips were so good!
My 22 month old son ate off the tots menu and had chicken goujons & chips which he enjoyed!

It would be rude to not have a dessert so I went for the Apple Pie and Ice Cream and my dad went for the New York Cheesecake. I didn’t particularly like the Apple Pie, there was nothing wrong with it as my parents liked it, I just think it was a bit to tart for me. My dads cheesecake was gorgeous apparently, so gorgeous that he wouldn’t let anyone else try any!

So we made another choice and ordered the children their meals and were all disappointed with our food. My son ended up his tears he disliked his meal so much as the pulled beef in his taco's (which were supposed to be make your own but came already made up) was so spicy he spent most of the time soaking his tongue in his water and my daughter left most of hers as she said her chips were awful and the burger not much better. I ended up giving most of my dinner to the children so they had something to eat and got the bill leaving with a bitter taste in my mouth of the whole experience and paying £46 for some lunch!..

I don't think we were disappointed like many reviews I'd read before. Lots of dark stained wood American car parafinalia and edison lights hanging precariously from pallets. We were given a real comfy window booth that provided plenty of entertainment watching a few drunk people putting on a show and a light bulb shorting out in comedic fashion.

I had ham, egg & chips and my partner had scampi & chips. For dessert we had the Eton mess and crème brulee respectively. I really enjoyed both my courses, whilst my other half also enjoyed his but perhaps didn’t think it anything extraordinary. The service and staff friendliness was good and the price reasonable.

Sadly our second visit was not as successful. Admittedly we did visit on a Sunday – a busy day for the restaurant – but it was at 4:30pm when we imagined the main lunchtime rush would have subsided. We are very patient and not overly bothered if we’re kept waiting for a while so long as we have drinks, but this meal took well over an hour and people arrived after us, were served their meals and had paid their bills all before our main course arrived! On this second occasion my other half had the salmon on a bed of baby potatoes and whilst the salmon was “OK” (not exceptional), the potatoes were apparently hard, so that was disappointing. By the time we’d eaten our main course we couldn’t spare the time for a dessert, so went without the lovely Eton mess! Again, I know Sunday is a busy day, but if a restaurant has the tables to accommodate a large number of guests I feel it assumes it can cope with serving them all.

This won’t put me off eating here again. It’s a good addition to the resort (a step up from the other Butlin's offerings) and is something the resort needs. The staff do try hard but sadly it scores 3 on this occasion for the very slow service on the Sunday and the hard potatoes.

Ordered food which again took ages,was frustrating as the staff were stood around chatting to two friends who had popped in

I ordered the venison burger. Which to be fair was OK. But had salad on the side which tasted really odd

Friend I was with ordered mixed kebab. There was no lamb so was just chicken and pork. This was inedible. The meat was so dry it could not be eaten

The restaurant itself really sets the scene and is fantastic with small children, specially since it is in the view of Arundel castle. Big carved wooden chairs, tabards and suits of armour all around. It even has a dressing up area if you really want to get in the mood for your feast (my little boy especially loved this).

If you want to eat quality ,freshly cooked, hearty food in a light hearted medieval atmosphere, this is the place. There are regular size tables but what makes the place stand out is the booths for larger groups and the huge dining table with a throne at either end and benches with rugs which is perfect for even larger parties. Waiting staff are all friendly and they know the menu so can give recommendations. On our first visit(a saturday night) we were entertained by our waitress who broke into song here and there and the magic monk who did close up magic at the table. There is also a medieval dress up rack for those photo opportunities! Nothing is forced, if you just want to sit and enjoy great food and drink with your friends its a good place to be, however, if you want to have a bit of medieval fun the staff are on hand to help and encourage that too.

Thought long and hard about eating here as it’s not got the magic 5 rating on the government food agency site, but in the end we decided to try it.

We didn’t get off to a great start as the first tonic water wasn’t too lively, so it went back. The second was better but whatever brand they use it certainly not Schweppes or Fever Tree!

We chose a mixture of starters and main courses.

Portion size was generous.

The big mistake I made was to order a Naga (spicy) dish but rather than lamb or chicken which was on the menu at £9, I asked for king prawn.

When the dish arrived it had exactly 4 king prawns in it, along with about a pint of Naga sauce.

I did mention this but the waiter just said “they are king prawns and it’s not on the menu”.

I also chose garlic naan. It came literally dripping with garlic sauce (or melted garlic butter), I poured it off but it was just about inedible.

The rest of the food was ok. King prawn balti (with a sensible number of prawns!). Plus quite a few veg dishes that were also ok.

The bill arrived and my 4 prawn dish had cost a whopping £14. Again I moaned but they just shrugged their shoulders.

Left pretty disgusted, and wouldn’t go back there I’m afraid.

For a starter I had calamari - the best I can remember - cooked in a light fresh batter. If you've been shunning this dish of late because it always tastes and feels like tough rubber, then please give it another chance here. It was faultless. To follow I chose the fish of the day - a fillet of sea bass. It was perfectly cooked and served on a bed of french beans and asparagus. Upon request a few saute potatoes were added to augment the dish. For pudding I had one of three homemade fruit pies on offer, served with ice cream or cream. To accompany the fish I had a glass of Sicilian dry white wine., which had lots of flavour and no harshness.
All-in-all it was a fabulous, tasty meal - leaving one feel nicely fed but not stuffed - and all for a very reasonable price. The quality of the cuisine could have come from a kitchen charging 50% more - if indeed you can find it.

Recently stayed at the Butlins Holiday park with a group of friends for one of their Adult Weekends and had the pleasure of visiting this cafe, after our designated chef decided to spend 40minutes trying to get the cooker to work, then getting the grill pan so hot that he ended up juggling the pan and the hot sausages placed in the pan until they fell on the floor. Luckily this Cafe is blessed with what I would consider to be a more capable and reliable kitchen staff that will cater for your every delight, whilst not spending over an hour only to provide partly cooked dirty sausages for your delicacy.

The cafe offers a range of breakfasts to suit every budget, our groups favourite is the Pagham, which is absolutely fantastic value and is becoming nationally renowned due to its popularity and value. Having previously visited other local establishments for breakfast such as the Regis, this cafe can be considered far superior. Genuinely they cannot do enough for you. (This was put to the test by one of our group, Freddie, who has a significant love of toast and ordered 10 additional pieces which duely came, piping hot and with enough butter to remain palletable.

I also asked if it would be possible to have either a glass of fizz or a cuppa together whilst we were having the pedicure and was to,d this would be fine.
The duration was confirmed at one hour.
On arrival we were given literally a few seconds to choose a colour of varnish and told not to bother with the swatch book as all the colours were not available.
Then to my surprise my daughter and I were taken off to separate rooms. I obviously questioned this and to my surprise was told that they did not have the facility to do two people together.
The pedicure was done lying down so would be difficult to drink wine or a cuppa.
,there was no option of gel polish and I was told we needed an extra 45 minutes at the end of the treatment for the nail polish to dry.
After painting the first foot, the beautician commented that the polish was nearly finished and was too thick. She said that she had no more and then poured something in to dilute it.
After the pedicure I was directed to a room to wait for the polish to dry. It was dark and cold with no heating on.
I can honestly say that this was not the pampering luxury visit I’d hoped for, and paid for.
I did phone to discuss my concerns and was told the spa manager would call me back. After several days I then phoned again and someone finally came back to me.

Good wine list, reasonable choice by the glass although the one I especially fancied was in the Special Section and I could not justify paying £15 for a glass as a poor OAP.

Prices generally in line for what you would expect for an hotel/restaurant of this nature. The voucher gave good value. A plus point is that they do not put a ""discretionary"" service charge on the bill, they suggest instead amounts based on either 10 or 15% but this does at least give the opportunity to reflect what has happened, the very late arrival of the sugar snap peas for example, without having to be brave and ask for subtraction of a suitable amount..",,proper bowl soup home,"['bowl', 'soup', 'home']",FoodPort,0.0,neutral,portion little generous similarfine diningestablishment proper bowl soup home baked warm bread accompanied

After a good walk we decided to stop for a coffee, then I spotted their special board - Hot Smoked Salmon and poached egg, my all time favourite, but could it compete with the best I’ve had so far down under in NZ. The quick answer is YES and by a long way. The salmon was just divine, the best I’ve had in a very long time, and that’s saying something because I always order it if it’s on the menu, as Tina Turner would say ‘simply the best’.
Hubby had the small GandG breakfast which he demolished with gusto, and to top it off the coffee was great, that in itself is something of an achievement in this part of the world, where it can be very hit and miss.

I ordered sag paneer - which is supposed to be cubes of cheese and spinach with cream, coconut and spices. What was actually served was dire. It was made with normal cheese which melted, so was mushy, with no flavour, at all, (no spices were added) a ton of cream and spinach. I only ate a very small amount, because it was so awful. I have never had sag paneer made with normal cheese, I tried it and regretted it - normal cheese in sag paneer is wrong and lazy.

I also ordered a side of vegetable curry. What I actually got was a bowl of frozen veg - peas, green beans, carrots in what I can only describe as slop. It looked like soup made with frozen veg. I sent that back and they offered a replacement. I declined.

My friend ordered a vegetable shashlic and that was slightly better, because it didn't look like soup and had a bit more flavour. Considering the cost to make with fresh vegetables, it was shocking to see most of ingredients were still obviously from a frozen packet.

(No Quorn curry on offer, which most good restaurants now serve for veggie customers).

The nan was great, perfect.

The rice was ok, hard to get that wrong.

My friends had chicken curry and that looked edible, they said it was 'OK', nothing special.

The pub/restaurant is sat directly in the grounds of Butlins, and has been a trusted venue for eats and drinks for some years now during our annual pilgrimages to Butlins holiday camp Adult Weekenders...

During this time we have seen the pub be tastefully redesigned to its current nautically themed state. Very fitting for its location.

The pub clearly has a great deal to offer and this is signalled by its popularity amongst celebrities... Over the years we have seen a raft of individuals ranging from Dan Akroyd and Bill Murray out of Ghostbusters to more recently the bizarre sight of Nick Hancock, Frank Lampard and a grown up Milky Bar kid playing 7 card Brag together whilst tastefully knocking back Cuba Libres - admittedly Frank looked a little overweight and the Milky Bar kid looked a little jaded but it was definitely them..

Now to the food - we'll you won't be disappointed. The pub does a whole range of meals to suit any appetite. If you are unlucky enough to have had to take your mrs along then there are popular classics such as Scampi or if it's a guys outing there are a range of Burgers to accompany those Cuba Libre's whilst youre sat promisingly clutching a prial of aces and a flush on the back hand. The food is always served piping hot, in fact one of our group always refers to the mouthwatering fries as ""hotter than the sun"" so be warned you may wanna lay that back hand before digging in to those delectable fried spuds.

The bar offers inside and outside seating where you can blissfully knock back your soda's or dig into your freshly prepared bacon double cheeseburger, here comes a word of warning though. If eating outside, we have noticed an increasing theme of what can only be describes as ""gull theft"" - turn your back on that delectable burger for one minute and a seagull will swoop in and knock it back faster than Geoff deleting his social media account. We have grown wise to this theme and now deploy a member of our party on ""Gull Watch"" I promise you, there is no way you wanna lose this food especially to a masked winged raider with a beak bigger than Phil Thompson's.

If you are visiting Butlins, this pub is a must. My one tip though is keep your eyes peeled, you never know who you might bump into, it could be Freddie, it could be Boy George, it could be Zorro the Seagull - whoever it is you'll be ""having a good time""",,wise theme deploy member partygull watchpromise way,"['wise', 'theme', 'deploy', 'member', 'watchpromise', 'way']",StaffGen,0.4767,positive,grown wise theme deploy member partygull watchpromise way want lose food especially masked winged raider beak bigger phil thompson is

The food eventually came after waiting 2 hours. This is an extremely long time considering we live within one mile of the takeaway. When it came I had wished it didn’t – it was completely cold and soggy. The crispy Chinese food we enjoy was cold and mushy. The food comes in tinfoil lined bags so it had sweated and gone cold. We microwaved the noodles but as the rest of the food looked a mess so we had to throw it in the bin.
I called the takeaway the following day, not really to complain but to let them know of the poor service I received. The guy told me he will tell the manager and he would get back to me whilst I would likely get 15% off my next order. I never heard back or got an apology from them, hence me writing this review. I wouldn’t go back even with 15% off. I paid £20 for a load of rubbish and the customer service was that of business that simply doesn’t care.

Go into the place and i was the only person there other than an elderly gent, door open on a cold day, tried to shut door which was stuck open. Music playing in the back kitchen where the host (presume Vicky) was at doing nothing in particular. Eventually she came to the front, no hello, no smiley face just a miserable attitude. I ordered a bacon sandwich and a cup of tea. I asked politely for ketchup on the sandwich, then informed “it’s on the table”. I asked for strong tea without sugar, to be told abruptly “sugar on the table and the bag’s left in to sort myself”. It cost £3.50, I only had a £10 note and was rudely asked if I had smaller. I said no and offered a card, then got change and sat at the table. Then the other gent got up and ordered, same attitude and when he asked for crispy bacon was told “obviously that’s going to take longer”.
After a while and relative silence in the restaurant area and muffled music from the back, my sandwich was delivered (nearly thrown on the table). Dry old bread, under cooked bacon and cheap Margarine. Someone else came in during my stay to check if they were open as he’d tried on two previous days to get in and they were shut.

I ordered fish and chips and was given a receipt to which I placed in my pocket. The gentleman in question later shouted out ''pie, burger and chips'' directed at me, to which I stated was not my order. he then shouted ''what number'' and I said that I didn't understand.

Now, I've eaten there several times and have never been asked for a number. After a little while, I noticed that my receipt actually had a number on it, so I then presented this to him. The said gentlemen made some very sarcastic and rude comments saying ''this is why we give number to ticket, I say number you no stand there, you tell me number yes''. he continued to yell at me and I couldn't actually speak over the volume of his aggressive tone.

I requested that he is not rude to me and that it's wrong to belittle a customer and speak with sarcasm. I also stated that his tone was unprofessional and that he wasn't clear originally, which caused the confusion.

Inside we were greeted by a very helpful guide who pointed out to us that a lift would take us upstairs to begin our tour we found all the guides to be most helpful and informative they were all a delight to talk to.
The castle is beautifully presented and maintained I couldn’t find a speck of dust and the views from the windows are sublime.
We enjoyed a bite to eat in the restaurant a doorstep bacon sandwich and tea very tasty and served by such happy and pleasant staff.
The gardens are very well kept and a delight to walk round we sat near the glass house for over an hour it was so peaceful the sun was shining which made our day if we lived closer I would be a constant visitor.

Unfortunately it was late season and many flowers were past their best but nevertheless there was plenty to please the eye both outside and in the greenhouses. We used a laid-on buggy to transfer to the castle as it is quite a walk. The tour around the different rooms was very good with much to see for all with an interest in history and art.

Even when I asked one of the staff where all the Knights were and showed her the event photo from the website she at first said that was a different day but then she realised it was this event said ""Um, no it's only actually a few""!. Maybe the wrong photo was used? The ""crafts show"" was in fact one chap sat at a table with a load of jewelery...the Knights bit was 5 chaps doing a demo of fighting for a couple of minutes 4 times spread out over the whole day. And that was it! My two Grandsons enjoyed the fighting and we walked to the Keep. Beware as there are lots of little narrow steps which are quite tricky to negotiate whilst holding a two year old's hand. We have been to other events at Arundel Castle (without the boys) which have been great and we were expecting this one to be similar. Our boys are 5 and 2 so they didn't realise it was a poor show but we did :-( . Our boys were too young to hang around waiting for the whole day so we left. It won't stop us visiting again as the castle is lovely - but pricey to keep going if the events disappoint.

The impressive, well maintained castle set on a hill is the home of the Duke and Duchess of Norfolk. There's a parking lot across the street from the entrance. Our basic Bronze tickets (£13 ea) allowed access to the Fitzalan Chapel, Gardens, Cafe & Gift Shop. Other tickets included the Keep & more of the castle. There were buggys (golf carts) to drive visitors w/ mobility issues up the hill to the gardens & castle. I'm sure that is very much appreciated! It was interesting to see a cork tree on the grounds.

The extensive gardens were absolutely beautiful! With well planned vistas and water features, there was a surprise around every corner. Carefully shaped hedges surrounded the different sections and created a wonderful backdrop for the beautiful flowers. Arbors, fountains & benches were lovely accents. A long archway had apple trees trained over it and was heavy with fruit. Interesting veggies in the kitchen garden. A coffee shop w/ outdoor tables would have been a lovely spot to linger on a sunny day.

However, the day of our visit was cool w/ extremely high winds which made it difficult to enjoy the gardens properly. We went to the cafe in the castle to get out of the wind. There were lots of tasty looking meals & snacks to choose from. The staff were very pleasant & helpful as they had been everywhere else. We enjoyed our tea & scones - it's not every day you get to have tea in a castle!

The interior of the castle that we could see with our ticket was exceptionally well maintained and clearly loved and looked after.

Arundel is a slightly out of the way village. That's good, as you don't want huge tourist crowds anyway. I had only time for the cheaper ticket, chapel and gardens plus entry to the shop and cafe. Those indoor areas give you some idea of the grandeur of the placce. The chapel is truly ancient and to me it did feel........ Well, awesome. The gardens are magnificent on a clear day. Huge stone walls surround them. Check the website as the castle has a long off season and is closed from autumn through to spring. It is still a family home, nothing like a ruin. You need plenty of time to see it to good effect. You would be disappointed if you set only 2 hours aside, that isn't really enough time for the whole thing. Take a small picnic to the gardens if you want, not a huge basket as you may have to leave that at security. Outside the castle the Arun River is nearby, where you will often see real white swans. Further up the road is a kind of Wetlands park, not cheap but it's supposed to be excellent for kids, and if you keep going, in under 15 mins you will get to a pretty lake with some nice walking behind it. It's just a pity that all accommodation for miles around is so expensive. Still, you can make it a day out, travelling from a hostel in Brighton.

We then went to the gardens which were amazing and then went to the moat ( see Characters from our History on their website to see where the meeting place is) and had a really good ( free) tour of the defences and history of the castle. The guide gets you all involved and uses any kids in the group as characters from history for example Queen Matilda and King Stephen

We then did a tour of the castle and motte which had amazing views from the top - it did help that we went on a fine clear day and had no rain.

We arrived to medieval music, horses and entertainment and that was before we’d even bought our tickets. (The system was down to prebook so had to queue for 15 minutes, wasn’t a bother with all that was going on).

On entering the grounds there was lots of stalls and things going on.. it was quite exciting!

We immediately heard that there was a Jousting tournament on and the first completion was about to start. What a spectacle.. first some warming up for the competitors and then the event began. It was our first time seeing an actual event
rather than the usual stunt shows. But this was definitely better and more exciting.

We continued to explore the castle, paying for all access and we were really impressive with the castle and all its rooms. So interesting and very well presented.

 Why they open the gardens at 10.00 but you can not enter the castle state rooms till 12.00 I wonder why ?. Having experienced a small queue at the castle entrance we were surprised how little there was of people inside the castle state room tour (perhaps most wanted to visit the gardens only) and there was no pushing or shoving as we have experienced at some properties.

Lovely items on display in various rooms ornately furnished with real history inside.

Years ago u could take photos inside courtyard.The gardens are really superb-I think these have been extended since my last visit over decade ago-they really are in bloom with so many colours.

Lovely walk around the grounds, there are inclines so be prepared! But if needing help they do have buggies to drive the elderly or walking impaired. The gardens are a must, we kept and gorgeous! The castle was worth viewing. All of the castle volunteers and staff were very friendly, helpful and happy to share their knowledge. The castle in incredibly interesting and well kept. Once inside i did see value for money for the admission tickets. The Duke still lives there, and some rooms on show are still used for special occasions.

Note that The Main Castle Rooms don't open till 12, this isn't really an issue as you can go around the Gardens, Grounds or The Keep first if you so wish.

There are various different levels of Tickets, which admit you to a differing level of areas. I'd suggest going for the Gold ticket as this lets you view everything apart from the Castle Bedrooms. When you're going around the rest of the rooms if you so decide you went to see the bedrooms then you can simply upgrade when you get there for an extra £2.

The castle is in an excellent state of repair and I was really quite impressed, along with the guides knowledge do ask them some questions because they have quite a bit of extra detail they can provide around the various different rooms, the library for example has 10,000 books within.

The Keep (the oldest part of the castle) is currently going through a bit of renovation awaiting sign-off from English Heritage but you can still get some excellent views from this vantage point.

We looked around the castle rooms in the morning, taking lunch in the restaurant. Portions we found were a good size, and lots of seasonal specials which reflected the weather which was good to see, I opted for the Caesar Salad, but you could easily bring a picnic to eat in the grounds if you so wished. You can also come and go as you please, you just need to get a hand stamp to be re-admitted.

The gardens were quite spectacular with a cottage garden with lots of fruit and veg been grown and also a more tropical garden as well. As well as this there is greenhouses to look around and extensive grounds you can walk around, along with a beautiful rose garden when they're in season. There is easily enough to do here for a whole day, I'd certainly recommend a visit!

BEST EVER!
WORTH A DETOUR!
Worth several detours. You MUST see it (if you’re interested in English history and how this Catholic family kept its collective head(s) (mostly) at a time (Henry VIII, Eliz I) when so many were losing theirs.)
The grounds: beautiful. So well kept.
The divided Fitzalan chapel: so interesting. Never seen a divided church before. Go and see St Nicholas church too, to see the other side.
The Keep: impressive.
The main building: fantastic. I mean... there are relics from Mary, Queen of Scots: the gold rosary beads she held at the time of her execution. Who knew that such things existed (still)?

It is all so good.

I read somewhere that if you want an indicator of how good, or not, an attraction is, go to the toilets. The toilets here: in the gardens; in the house are the best too.

The view of the castle and cathedral as we drove towards the town was absolutely stunning.

Big car park opposite the entrance with good toilet block and disabled facilities. We had lunch in a lovely tea room in the town a very short walk away.

My husband is in a wheelchair and from the moment we entered the gate till we left, we felt the staff were without question the best we have come across, so helpful and friendly.

We were advised what tickets to buy and the disabled van called to take us to the farthest point and we made our own way back down. The gardens are stunning, with an architectural section, greenhouses, a flower section and kitchen garden. All thriving. Good toilet block here and places to sit and a stunning view of the cathedral.

Next stop was the chapel and white garden. So much history and beauty. The lady in here reminded us of Joanna Lumley, gorgeous and went out of her way to help.

Then into the castle itself. We were led to a couple of different elevators, the second was tiny, to get to the start of the tour. Right from the start the castle rooms and fascinating history blew us away. The sheer size, elegant furnishings and decor, artwork etc, just breathtaking. Our one tiny annoyance was apparently our tickets didn’t allow entry to the bedrooms. Gold not gold plus. I think the ticket lady had assumed I would not want to see the bedrooms if my husband could not get up there.

We didn’t have time to use the cafe or climb the tower. All reasons for a return visit on a future trip. Btw, the tickets were a fair price. A couple of other places we visited charged a lot more and not as good.

There are lots of interesting things to see spanning many centuries of history and the gardens are some of the best planned, best planted gardens I have visited tended by enthusiastic staff. It is worth buying the gold ticket because it enables you to visit the bedrooms which are worth a visit and interestingly are still used when there are castle guests. The voucher that the gold ticket includes is redeemable anywhere in the castle. However, the star of the visit has to be the guide for the 'Dry Moat tour'. He is so informed, interesting and charismatic. He brought the history of Arundel alive, drawing in the audience to play characters from the history in order to make it all easier to understand and follow. He is absolutely brilliant.

Entrance is very expensive and also very complicated. 4 different price plans for a ‘normal’ adult, then vouchers to use at the over priced gift shop and cafe. You get asked at least 6 times during your visit to the castle to show your ticket.

The biggest disappointment was the lack of history explained. The information given as you walk around is in no sensible chronological order and doesn’t give any stories. You do however know the dimensions of a room, when it was renovated and by whom. I don’t care about that, give me some basic simple history please. Like in every other castle and historic home.

The wife and I were really looking forward to our visit and were left very disappointed. We were planing to bring the children sometime but we won’t waste our time or money now.

We visited on a Saturday, slightly out of the main tourist season and the place was very popular with tourists, many of which were from outside the UK, which should help the balance of payments deficit!
There is plenty of parking in the town and opposite the main entrance for the castle.
As we are English Heritage members we got £2 per person off admittance but were not able to book online (which would have given us a £1 per person discount) so the net effect of being EH members was a £1 per person discount. I think it should change so that the EH members should be able to get a £2 discount + £1 online discount. Simply show your pass on the day to verify your EH membership.
What was a good idea was the way the gift aid works there. You pay more for your ticket but you get vouchers that can be used in the shop or café for a value that is £2 per person greater than your ticket. So we paid £4 more each but got a voucher for £6 to use in the castle – worth doing.
There is a one way people flow system in the castle and the staff don’t really like you going against the flow of traffic, as we did a couple of times. Saying that it got a little confusing about what level of ticket did what. We had gold plus £(22 pp with gift aid and £2 EH discount) so could go anywhere but once in the house we went past an area that people with gold plus tickets can access and then had to double back. To be honest I think one level of ticket should suffice unless numbers are trying to be suppressed in the apartments. Staff are friendly enough and will offer plenty of interesting facts if you engage them.
The café is nicely decorated with interesting chair designs, replicated on the high chairs, which is a nice touch. Drink and food was good and reasonably priced although the service / throughput was painfully slow. It needs re-organising – lots of people there doing stuff but not getting the customers through quickly at all. Come on Arundel you need to sort this before the really busy tourist season starts.
Another thing that is needed at the castle is an audio guide or a tour. There is so much to see and learn about it’s a real shame that these aren’t options.
Everything is immaculately presented and the castle itself is in tip top condition as are the gardens. Do make sure you take time to explore all the grounds especially the Fitzalan chapel and the amazing tombs in there.
You definitely need a full day here and to that extent the entrance fee represents fair value for money. A great castle but they could still make some improvements to the visitor experience.

We watched as the knights battled and the archers fired their arrows, he even had a go at archery himself. There was also a brilliant Birds of Prey display when we were there too.

Gardens were in full tulip bloom. Not a horticulturist so would have been useful to sign the trees and age as some must date back 100s of years.
Jousting, birds of prey and ware stalls present this weekend. Fascinated by the guy making the chain armour. Each vest takes 1000 man hrs and has about 10000 links. Knowledge of their trade was very impressive.
Every person we came across even in the cafe and restaurant were professional, polite and seemed to enjoy their roles.

On one occasion, we were sat on a bench when two adult geese walked up to us with their 7 goslings, showing them off, and probably hoping for some food too. The adults or children, certainly weren't frightened of humans or aggressive towards us. The visitor centre, cafeteria and gift shop were all very clean, tidy, airy and inviting.

We found a large variety of rides, and thought it was great value - free entry, and £20 for unlimited rides which our 10 and six year old certainly got their moneys' worth out of! Staff were friendly and helpful and the whole place was very clean.

I would have expected the whole park to be a no smoking area, or for there to be a designated area near the entrance, as a number of people were smoking close to queues which was off-putting. My only other comment would be that something outdoors for little ones would be helpful, like a sandpit or some sort of outdoor softplay area. There is indoor softplay but you can't be in there with a little one if you need to watch older ones outside. After discovering he didn't like the spinning barrel ride my poor one year old just had to stay in his pushchair and watch everybody else have fun all day.

We stayed pretty much the full 11-6 opening hours and used the £18 wristband (purchased online) with that i also received a stamp to go on rides with him for free as he is under 1.2m (by quite a bit, I reckon you could use this until they're almost 6yrs). As he was under 1.1m the only ride he couldn't go on was the big swing, aside from that everything was open to him, either in his own or with me sat next to him. I don't know if it's because it was inly the Easter holidays and not the summer yet, but it wasn't heaving as I had expect it to be, we didn't really queue at all, just waited for one ride to finish before jumping in to the next. The staff were lovely, he really enjoyed the drivable boats and the staff looking after them were really involved and helpung the kids move around and chase them, it really makes a difference (especially after 7 hours in a park 1:1 with a 4yr old, it was nice to let someone else engage with him while i guzzled haribo on the bench for sustenance!) The log flume was fab, but before you go on go to the photo booth next to it and buy a poncho! I didn't realize these were available until we had done 4 consecutive trips on it and were soaked through.... Photo booth sells pics from both the log flume and the caterpillar rollercoaster (also a big hit with him, and one go on it is actually 3 times round, so if you're buying individual ride rickets its decent value.) The soft play was fab, it's also included in the price of the wristband and includes a small under 3's area. I managed to leace him in there for well over an hour while i dried out (log flume) and drank tea (1.70, very nice), it has ball canon things which the kids fill ip with foam balls and blast around, looked like a really popular part of it. The whole soft play area was a really good size, and the entrance is staffed but you still need to keep an eye as they can't possibly monitor all the kids and who their parents are ( i just sat facing the exit and hoping he stayed put!) 2 big arcade style areas in the 2 buildings, plenty to do and crucially, lots of 2p machines with little stools for standing on (nice touch). The park itself is also dog friendly (I assume not inside though..) and its right in the beach so its ideal for a full day out if you don't want to stay glued to the rides as we were. I will be 100% returning!

The menu states served with salad but this consisted of a small amount of lettuce and a slice of tomato placed in the bun which made the burger even colder. We also ordered a bacon sandwich, the bacon was so over cooked, it wasn't just crispy it was incinerated - no moisture left in it and bitter tasting. We also ordered a chicken and bacon panini, the chicken was fine but the bacon was of the same type as in the bacon sandwich.

We didn't complain at the time as the food area was very busy (and slow) and we didn't want to spoil an otherwise pleasant day out with our family.

I have never noticed this before but the list of characters included lines spoken by them - very useful for those theatregoers such as myself, who have a tendency to doze through performances - so we had one character who said “Blessed is he who expects nothing”, but another had the depressing line, “Time, please.” (hopefully not the heroine)
Then on to “Alice’s (wartime) Kitchen” where you can listen to her talk about her delicious vegetable pies and dried egg concoctions. I was intrigued to know that the BBC Home Service regularly broadcast an 8.15-8.20 wartime slot called “The Kitchen Front” giving advice to housewives just before they went out for the “morning shop”. (None of the weekly supermarket shop nonsense in those days!) However, Alice must have been telling little fibs - or perhaps her memory is not so good these days - when she spoke of later listening to “Life With the Lyons” on the wireless, as this didn’t start until 1950.
A photograph reminded me that my favourite comedian, Tony Hancock, had filmed “The Punch and Judy Man” in Bognor Regis. As a devoted fan, I have previously stayed in his parents’ old hotel in Bournemouth.
I also enjoyed the room full of old wirelesses, memories of being a kid, bouncing a ball around the living room and breaking the screen on my parents’ old “Philco” came flooding back, although the collection at the museum in Droitwich - those were the days for wireless transmission! - is probably more extensive.
A sign told me that beer was “watered down” during World War 1 - not sure whether this was landlords making their supplies stretch a bit, or it was by government decree - but the thought that “being drunk was seen as being unpatriotic” seems a bit harsh after spending all that cash on weak beer. (Personally, I’m still following the directive about “no-one being allowed to buy a round a drinks.”)
Altogether, very enjoyable and lots of fun!

I took my son down to Arundel to meet Kevin who was there to meet us with a wonderful selection of birds of prey. We spent a good couple of hours in the company of the birds while, one after another, they flew perfectly for us. There is something about having a 6 pound eagle owl landing on your glove, with feet as big as your hands, that’s hard to put into words!

Apart from the beauty and power of the birds themselves, it’s obvious from the start that Kevin is a total professional. All licence and insurance paperwork is on display and as soon as you arrive you can see the birds are clean, happy and in perfect condition. Kevin’s dedication to his birds is obvious from the way he handles and interacts with them. They watch his every move and respond perfectly, even for us amateurs.

Thanks Kevin and Emma, hope to see you again sometime.

We met Kevin as planned and on schedule and a short drive to the edge of a magical woodland.
Here we met Sky - a female Harris Hawk who was just magnificent. Gloved up we walked into the woods and Kevin proceeded to educate and entertain us as Sky flew around us with regular and frequent trips back to our gloves to feed. I rate and review many things on Trip Advisor all over the world and I truly think this was the best I’ve ever reviewed.
Sky excelled herself when she roused some barn owls who flew across us and although Sky may have been tempted, she returned to the glove when called. She the proceeded to spot and catch a mouse in the forest underground. Some people may not have liked this, but it was true nature at work and just great to witness.
If you like nature, birds of prey and stunning scenery, this is a must for you.

Initially, we met the enthusiastic Pauline in the Gift Shop who told us that the gardens had inspired Beth Chatto to create her well known dry, gravel garden near Colchester, Essex.

The curved beds, gravel walk ways, superb naturalistic planting, the unmown grass in certain areas, the “river bed” leading to one of the best ponds that I have ever seen and the occasional statues, all help to make this one of the most interesting and inspiring gardens that we have ever visited. I said jokingly to Briony who deals with some of the propagation that she would be most welcome to come and create something similar in our garden.

I mentioned to Karen who was working industriously in the garden until I interrupted, that I could not find the sculpture by Marion Smith which according to the plan was located near the far pond. Sadly, she told me that the staff had come to work one morning to find that the sculpture was missing, presumably taken by someone over the back wall. Hopefully, a heavier replacement will be in situ at sometime

There is also a newly constructed Tearoom and very clean toilets.

The service was mixed, every time we sat for a drink/food we had to ask for a menu/to be served and then chase them. Shouldn’t be a surprise we wanted to eat and drink, also bad for their business as they are losing out on revenue by not serving and making people wait.
The eve meal was disappointing, poor produce, small portions and very bland. The chef should not be Proud of that. My breakfast was lame, veggie breakfast with no sausage = one shrivelled tomato, one burn mushroom and a tiny portion of beans, looked pathetic on the plate!
The spa is run down, nice on the surface but tired and so so busy. Couldn’t even get a seat to feed our 8 month baby, loads of towels left and no one overseeing removing them.
Stayed in the chain a number of times, this is is by far the worse and only gets away with due to the location/building.
Save your money and go elsewhere

The pool and facilities are available to hotel and members to use. Although the pools were pretty empty, there were not enough beds to go round and we had to share a bed as did others.
 From arrival to Lunch was 5 hours, which we knew when we booked. On arrival there was a machine upstairs to make your own tea or coffee. We were told snacks were available during the morning but were not. In the end we had to ask and were told only biscuits were available which we gladly accepted. All food and drink is taken in the lounge which is upstairs, so we were up and down several times.
Cream tea was included in our package but was inedible, with the scones being bitter to taste and of a sand like texture. We reported this to reception and were told they would be taken back to the kitchen , we were offered a soft drink as recompense but declined. We aware also told the hotel would be in contact regarding this but they never did.
I wouldn't s place unless you just want a massage and a quick swim but a £160 it is a waste of money

We paid extra to be on the ground floor and together. (Gold) We got the ground floor but were in different blocks😬. On complaining the receptionist said we were never going to be together as they do not have two 6 person rooms together so we were mislead on booking. She said she would listen to the taped conversation to see what Butlins had said and call us back, still waiting.

Room block 4 floor was filthy and there were no shelf’s in the oven, shower head kept falling of.
Room block 5 floor was also filthy and all our pans etc had not been washed. Lots of cigarette buts out side our room which kept getting walked in. Was told they would be cleared up but never was.
A cleaner did come over and clean the rest of stuff that we hadn’t finished cleaning on arrival.

Wanted to hire the bikes out, but apparently they do not hire them adults only week ??
The fair was not open either.

We all paid to have a spa, the changing rooms had two toilets and two showers no changing separate room which is uncomfortable if you don’t wish to get changed in front of anybody, we were all queuing for a shower.
The main changing room was very small and hot, very uncomfortable considering you should be relaxing.
The spa itself seem to have to many people in at once. It was over an hour before any of us could use the hot tub also the ice room was broke.
I did have a facial and that was very good.

It has a special place in the hearts and minds of locals, and never fails to capture my imagination. Cissbury Ring is what remains of a bronze age hillfort, when ancient Britons settled the high ground above present day Findon village and surrounded themselves with ramparts. The earthwork fortifications are extremely well preserved and remain to this day, enclosing a plateau marked by a trig point. Upon the plateau would have sat the roundhouses of the people that resided there thousands of years ago, pre-dating the Roman invasion of Southern England. There is a free car park at the base of the ring, though a more enjoyable walk would involve parking in Findon village (there's a free car park or spaces along the village crossroads, though this can be limited) and walking uphill from town. Cissbury Ring itself is completely free of charge. Paths from Cissbury head into Worthing town, or across country to Chanctonbury Ring a couple of miles distant, another bronze age site that was a later Roman religious shrine. From the trig point on Cissbury one can enjoys views of Worthing, Littlehampton, the coastal strip of West Sussex and other parts of the South Downs National Park.

The trail from the carpark to the plateau is quite steep but is extremely short. Despite the popularity with locals, Cissbury is one of West Sussex's least known special parts, and for naturists/walkers/history buffs is a must see if you happen to be in the area.

Paths from Cissbury head into Worthing town, or across country to Chanctonbury Ring a couple of miles distant, another bronze age site that was a later Roman religious shrine. From the trig point on Cissbury one can enjoys views of Worthing, Littlehampton, the coastal strip of West Sussex and other parts of the South Downs National Park.

The trail from the carpark to the plateau is quite steep but is extremely short. Despite the popularity with locals, Cissbury is one of West Sussex's least known special parts, and for naturists/walkers/history buffs is a must see if you happen to be in the area.

While I can’t comment on the gym as we only swam I can say that we found the facilities very average, albeit very new.
The reception area is large and has a small cafe to the side overlooking the large car park. There was only one person on duty when we arrived who was dealing with a gym membership enquiry so we had to wait some time to be able to pay for swimming (£5.65 for an adult).
Our group was 3 adults and 2 children (8 months and 2 years) and we used both the family changing cubicles and a normal one. Changing rooms were basic standard changing rooms with soaking wet tiled floors which as you can wear your outdoor shoes in are inevitably dirty and muddy, it smelt fresh though. Lockers were a good size and cost £1.
The swimming pools themselves were disappointing. What was nice about the old pool (and why we travelled to littlehampton to swim) was the temperature of the children’s pool which was very warm and great for the little ones but the new one is pretty cold.
The new pools have no atmosphere and felt quite unwelcoming. White walls and ceiling and very bright lights made it feel very clinical and cold. There is also nothing for the children to look at and they got bored and cold quickly.

1799,790,10328,Bognor,2,"A lot of room for improvement I write my review based on visiting all of the Mr P arcades. I will not waffle on but here is the basics.

For starters, not all of the machines are on their best payout percentages. Their website claims they have the best percentage payouts, this may be true in comparison to other amusements but losing £1000 through a £70 jackpot machine is definitely not 90%.

Any machine player will generally know if a machine is worth playing. A sign for this is “being full up”. Mr P arcades refill their machines and I have experienced this personally many times in each branch. For example, a party time could be full, the coins are dropping, you win £50 collect it and only pays £19 before going empty, then they refill or flick the hopper top up switch after only refloating £31. The next player then thinks it’s full up but does his balls in.

The arcade opening times are very early to close, however, if you are a promoter of their business via youtube, they will stay open till all hours for you, but not to normal customers.

The owners will lend people money who they get on well with, but others they will not, not very professional.

The staff will empty machines whilst you go for a fag or to the bank.

The arcades never ever have enough pound coins in, staff always have to empty machines half way through playing to get coins.

No loyalty rewards given, where as other arcades you get some kind of rewards. However you do get some free play each visit, on certain machines.

Often machines spend weeks out of use because the owners do not drive. The staff on site do not generally know how to fix the machines when they malfunction.

The air conditioning is pretty much non existent in all 3 arcades. It’s very hot in summer and stuffy most days.

You may get refreshments but that has been abused so seems to be cut back a bit.

All in all, the machines are there for “nostalgia” and certainly as with any arcades you cannot “make money” from, it’s all entertainment. You can get lucky, or you can be very unlucky.

The reason for my low score is that the brand continues to maintain they are this that and the other but in fact they are not. I’ve seen various lies, various untoward behaviour, very unfair ethics. All customers should be treated the same, whoever they are. Opening and closing should be set. Filming of other arcade users without their permission should not be allowed. They will write essays on their social media to portray they are amazing people, which some fall for, but let’s face it - they are only in it for the money in reality, nobody starts a business just for the love, otherwise they would be skint in no time.",example party could full coin dropping win collect pay going empty refill flick hopper top switch floating,empty refill flick hopper top switch,"['refill', 'hopper', 'top', 'switch']",BeachFac,0.0,neutral,

Mr. P's however has a very different philosophy, old machines from the mid 80's to early 2000s golden era of AWPs, that are actually fun to play and with very generous payouts. You'll probably never be rich after a visit to any arcade - but at least after Mr P's you'll have a large smile on your face rather than a handful of worthless paper tickets :)
