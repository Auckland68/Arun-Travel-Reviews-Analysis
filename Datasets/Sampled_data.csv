0,Fish & Chips,Food,Bognor, Fast Food/Takeaway,56,Questionable practice of 'Cash only',"No indication it was 'cash only', and why - a family of six to pay cash is highly irregular in this day and age. This was a meal inside the establishment and with bills that don't even have the shop name on, would question this practice. Let's hope tax is paid in full by the owner and not a repeat Pret A Manger practice.
Gherkins at £1 each was an absolute disgrace. We were assured they were huge and indeed the ones in the jar on the counter were. Whereas, we were served gherkins no more than 3"" in length and 1"" in diameter tops and were charged £1 each. Rip off Britain certainly applies here.
Fish was freshly cooked and ok but chips were dry.",2,1.0,2.0,Seafood,1
1,Ocean Hotel & Spa,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,11,Disgustingly dirty rooms!!,"We visited for a family break in July with 2 young children. As Butlins prides itself on catering for family’s especially with its ‘tots breaks’ we expected the accommodation to be clean. On arrival in our room we noticed hair in the toilet, hair in the bath, carpet looked like it hadn’t been touched with a Hoover, thick dust on the phone and tv (clearly not been cleaned for ages) you could leave finger prints in the dust!! filth all over the coffee tray and filth in the fridge, dust and grime around the edges of the floor and sliding door, some disgusting bit of muck on the sink! we have never complained before to a hotel but the standard was poor and made us feel dirty just looking at it! The manager was very good and moved us to the service recovery room. This at first glance appeared a lot better. Then in the children’s room there was thick dust on the windowsill, the remote for the children’s tv had the batteries held in by 2 plasters which is ridiculous!! ..a hair clip, 1p piece and small bouncy ball had all be overlooked when cleaned and my one year old grabbed 2 of these items off the floor!
The lifts are crazy, you stand there for ages and when one does arrive you can’t fit in. When I put in a letter of complaint I was told the lifts are fit for the amount of guests but I wonder if they have actually considered how many of their guests have young children in buggy’s! In my opinion and many of the people we talked to in the que It would seem not! When I wrote a letter of complaint they took little responsibility for the state of the rooms and stated that they had a ‘resolve on site policy’, having already wasted time moving from the filthy room to the ‘service recovery room’ which was still dirty I would wonder why they would think I would bother complaining more on site. Surely the service recovery room is as good as it gets! All in all I wouldn’t bother with this hotel especially as Butlins are not prepared to take responsibility for their issues and effectively blame their guests for not wasting more of their holiday time complaining about what should never have been an issue in the first place!",2,3.0,2.0,0,1
2,Butlers,Food,Arundel, Restaurant,14,Clearly very cliquey - no gluten free bread!,"We came here on a Sunday and enjoyed a lovely Sunday roast - really delicious and great roast potatoes.
The only problem was the service received - the restaurant clearly has a lot of loyal customers that are very kissy kissy with the female manager. This is fine and is typically a sign of a good restaurant - however it isn’t great when you are treated differently to them. For example, on arrival we asked for a cock tail menu and were told no cocktails on a Sunday. I have been before just for drinks on a Sunday and enjoyed an espresso martini and also a pornstar martini so was surprised to hear they weren’t available. I then noticed the table next to us had almost empty pornstar martinis (including the Prosecco glass) and the table that arrived after us (kissed the manager) and were given cocktails...
The staff weren’t very attentive even leaving our empty glasses on our table for the duration of the meal, we were practically stacking them at the end. Our plates took ages to clear also.

They don’t have gluten free bread which is quite unacceptable these days with over 1 in 100 people affected by a gluten intolerance or allergy so I watched my husband enjoy his bread whilst I waited for my starter...

6,Cardanom Bay,Food,Bognor, Restaurant,103,"Worst service ,rude staff","We visited as a group of 6 , table was booked weeks in advance for 8pm , arrived table not ready , we said we will go off and come back which we did , 30 minutes later table was ready . Waiter quickly took drinks order , left leaving no menus . Eventually brought menus , ordered food and waited hour and half for “complimentary starter” . Asked when main course would be served was told another hour , 2 1/2 hour wait for food was a bit extreme especially as Resturant had emptied in the time we had sat and waited, by that point we had all lost the will to live , and were all starving so left .

8,Butlers,Food,Arundel, Restaurant,68,A welcome return,"I first went to this gem of a restaurant around 16/17 years ago and would be a regular visitor until I moved away from the area. The restaurant has since been refurbished - very tastefully - and has the benefit now of an outside seating area which, on the particular weekend we went, was great as we could sit outside with our drink and enjoy the warm evening.

There were four of us this particular evening. I had tomato soup with basil oil, my husband had king prawns (a large portion and very delicious!), my friend had pate and her partner had crab cakes. For main, I had chicken served with cabbage and potato lyonnaise whilst the other three all had lamb which was beautifully tender and well cooked. Two of us had salted caramel tart served with milk ice cream and another had cheese. The tart was delicious!

I was happy to see that the same family are still running the restaurant after all these years and the staff were all pleasant and discreet when serving.

Looking forward to returning on our next trip to the area!",5,2.0,2.0,Other,0

12,"Crossbush, Beefeater",Food,Arundel, Steakhouse/Diner,122,Happy Birthday- what a disaster,"My son decided to take my wife (Who’s birthday we were celebrating), me and his family out to the Crossbush Beefeater’s.

We had booked a table to 16:00, but arrived 15 minutes early. We were shown to our table at about 15:50 and given the menus to read.

After 35 minutes the kids were getting restless so I grabbed the next waitress to go past and asked what I needed to do to get server.

She said they were very busy and apologised after explaining she was the only person looking after the area. She asked if we had ordered drinks. As we hadn’t we gave her the drinks order which turned up one short after 15 mins.

We asked to see the allergy menu and were told that the manager would have to serve us and she’d as him to come over. 10 minutes later he comes over and asks us what we would like to eat. We asked for the allergy menu and after that was sorted we have him our order to be told that the roast dinners were all sold out. That’s the first we’d heard of that after need at the table for over an hour.

We placed our order and waiting over 40 mins for that to arrive.

My wife’s steak which was supposed to be medium to well done was cremated and dry, my sones steak as part of his grill was supposed to be rare to medium and was well done, his chicken was cremated. His wife’s cheese burger was burnt and dry. My pie was had rock hard pastry and over cooked vegetables. The peas were a funny green and tasteless as if they’d bee cooked for a long time.

All in all a disaster for my wife’s birthday.

I collared the manager and explained about the food, he apologies and said he wouldn’t charge us anything, but the damage was done.

We ate what we could and left as soon as we could.

This is the second really poor mean we’ve had at this beefeaters, so I cannot see us going back.

What is the point of doing a 40% off promotion as well a being in taste card if you done get the staff in both the front of the house and in the kitchen, they obviously didn’t get extra staff in either!

14,Bailiffs Court,Accommodation,Littlehampton,Hotel,29,Quirky property and that’s where the fun ends ....,"During our 24 hour stay, I’m not sure we met a single person who knew what they were doing. And that’s not for the lack of staff. After what felt like a reluctant ‘end of shift’ welcome at the front desk, we were shown to our room at the other side of the site. The guy showing us around didn’t know the facilities and referred us to a new guide in the room and said everything we needed to know would be in there. We we’re left thinking why bother and just provide the key? However when we found our way around the room we just felt it lacked facilities and was old and antiquated - in need of an upgrade!
We had paid for one of the more expensive rooms with a four poster bed. This was probably the best part about it. The rooms are poorly equipped; an old sofa facing and dirty tv in a sitting room area, no mini bar despite being far from the main part of the hotel, large bathroom but the shower stopped working half way through washing and left one of us roaming the room for 15 mins covered in soap. We tried to call reception to report and get some help, but we’re told ‘turn all the taps on and that should reset it’. This didn’t work so we called back at which point they sent someone from house keeping, who on arrival said ‘I can’t help you’. We gave up, sat for a further 15 mins and had another go. Fortunately some cold water had returned enabling a rinse before dinner. We reported this when back at the house and received a £100 discount on the bill and an offer to move rooms. Having already wasted time and feeling frustrated, we stayed where we were to avoid the hassle of packing and unpacking again. We thought we’d just get up and leave in the morning.
The main house and restaurant are essentially a network of little rooms with a mish mash of chairs - plus the main restaurant. We were early for dinner and thought we’d grab a drink. We struggled to find anywhere to sit and when we did couldn’t to find anyone to serve us as they were all stood around chatting. They forgot to call us for dinner and after 15 mins we had to go and find someone. Sat at the table we were presented with a mostly empty bread basket and no choice, so declined, only to see full baskets with more choice being offered later. It took an hour and a quarter to receive our main course despite pre-ordering 90 mins earlier and we had to pour our own wine. The food was actually very good when it arrived.
Breakfast in the morning wasn’t much better as we sat forgotten waiting for coffee for 20 mins. We complained and were then asked what we had ordered again as it had been put in the bin. The hap hazard service continued as I received two poached eggs that were hard and looked like they’d been on the floor.
On top of this we paid a premium price for two spar treatments on day one. The treatments were actually very good but the-facilities, much like most of the buildings needed a good clean. Staff just stand around despite there being dirty cups and plates in the relaxation room, along with crumbs on the furniture. Towels just littered the place in the changing rooms and by the pool. Garden umbrellas lean against the wall inside, which just says we don’t care about presentation. The food and drinks are really expensive in the Spa and not great quality either. Two sandwiches and one glass of wine for £35.
All in all we felt it was a really poor experience. When we explained our disappointment at check out we were still only offered a miserly £100 off the final bill of nearly £1000. They advertise a luxury, unique experience but the reality couldn’t be further from the truth. Unique in its incompetence maybe.
We had paid the majority upfront when reserving our rooms but we left without paying the final amount in disgust given they weren’t prepared to take our comments and thoughts seriously. The arrogance in dismissing our experience as purely ‘our opinion’ is a further amateur hour outrage. We await a call...

AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!

16,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,21,The Pub and Kitchen was a pleasant surprise.,"A group of 4 of us stayed 2 nights here and had a meal at the Pub and Kitchen on the Saturday. All 4 of us had the steak and all 4 of us asked for it done differently, rare, medium rare etc . We weren't expecting too much from a Butlin's restaurant but it was excellent. All 4 steaks were cooked to perfection, so much so that we asked to speak to the chef, Kelly, to congratulate her on doing such a brilliant job. We guys know our steaks and we had to say this was one of the best steak experiences we'd had in a long time. Outstanding !! The waiter, Tony (from Liverpool I think), was very very good and really helped to make the evening a very pleasant experience. Would highly recommend this restaurant.

19,Cardanom Bay,Food,Bognor, Restaurant,12,Disappointed,"Have been using the restaurant for quite a few years. Went out with parents and they had warned us about additional service charge the restaurant has been recently adding. We get to the end of meal and request the bill, we find 10% is added. My parents are in the trade and point out this is a optional charge and there is no obligation to pay it! However on previous occasions they went to the cardamom bay and again this time, the higher amount including the 10% is entered by the restaurant into the chip and pin machine. I ask for the machine so I can put the correct amount in (without the 10%) One staff member became rather rude and others started pointing out to my parents that they had been charging this extra amount for a long time and what was the problem? Well the problem is you don’t levy stealth charges! Yes times are hard and we’re all trying to earn a shilling, but you don’t rip people off.......be open and honest and politely ask customers if they would like to leave a tip!!

20,Cinnamon,Food,Littlehampton, Restaurant,248,April anniversary meal ,"Meant to write this a few weeks ago.
We came out for a relatively cheap night out as we are saving for a few things, but still wanted to mark the occasion of our anniversary.
Nice and quiet on a Friday night though lots of deliveries were going out.

The duck tikka starter was to die for. I've never had it before and I wasn't disappointed! My other half had a mixed kebab and he said it was very tasty.

For main I had a chicken morisa, asked for extra chili and garlic rice. Beautiful. No complaints. Generous portions and presented wonderfully.
My partner loves vindaloo yet facncied the flavour of a tikka masala. So he opted for the spicy tikka masala which I think is his new firm favourite.

For side I just had to try the chili Dal. Whoa , next time I'd just be happy with that and a couple of sides. VERY impressed by the chili Dal. You don't get it on the takeaway menu , not the spicy masala or morisa. Which is a bit annoying but I guess that's the tug to make you eat in. I suppose you can ask for it though not tried yet possibly through a phone order. Anyway eating in is ten out of ten. Yum yum yum! And not extortion prices

Accomodation very clean and well appointed. It's a pain that they have blocked the direct path from the car park with the Big Top, Makes moving in and out more of a challenge.
Food in resturaunts excellent especialy the Diner. Amazing ribs
 Shout out to brilliant waitress Sarah.
The shop is reasonably priced but no fresh fruit beyond the odd banana.

Pool is great for the children. Differing levels and poorly marked edges make it a challenge for supervising grandparents. Good to read that they have raised the age on the rock slide. It was mainly deserted during our visit. This may also relieve the queues for the other rides.
 The changing rooms are well thought out but the trade off of being able to change little feet in the cubicle rather than the usual scrum at the door does mean that the floor looks dirty. They do clean it constantly.
Entertainment was ok.
Fairground was great indoors and out but why close so early??
Football, the robobike things and climbing coaches were superb. I think the nominal charge improved the experience.
Beach was fun at low tide and a short walk along the prom to the right is a great little play area.
My main moan is the arcade. The machines and tickets are a big hit with the children and adults who want a quiet coffee, but come on Butlins! We expect to loose money but I swear from observation that diligence in refilling tickets is poor. In the end they didn't get enough to win more than a lollypop and even at their bedtime the queue to redeem tickets was ridiculous. So they didnt even get that.
It was a good holiday for 5 days but I think 7 would have been pushing it unless you intend to go out and do some sightseeing.

38,The Lamb Inn,Food,Bognor, Pub/Bar,9,Awful sunday roast & rude owner,"Was visiting my cousin for the weekend so before heading home decided to have lunch so booked the lamb. We were first in restaurant at 12.30 so order taken promptly by lovely girl. On a sunday its a 3 course set menu for £19.50pp. For starters we ordered the fried brie & chicken lollipops. Received within 10 mins. The lollipops were the 2 popcorn sized bites on a bone in breadcrumbs-well overcooked & 2 bites. For mains we ordered roast beef & lamb. The roast potatoes were rock hard you couldnt even cut with knife, the yorkie burnt & the veg had a funny taste & well over cooked. The beef was so fatty, grisly & you couldnt even cut through it so my cousin couldnt eat it so we told the waitress. She apologised & took our plates away, she offered us another dinner but we declined.

(Would love to see them eat it) My cousin said sorry we beg to differ as she couldnt eat it & his responce was ""ive taken 10% off your bill"" & just walked away!!!! A true professional manager should have apologised,listened to his customers with empathy & should have not of charged us for 1 of the meals as not eaten-a measly £3.20 off total bill & the rudeness was unbelievable.

40,Bailiffs Court,Accommodation,Littlehampton,Hotel,1,Overnight Spa Stay,"Had a lovely stay here, Spa facilities were great and the Spa itself wasn't overpopulated. Stayed in a ""mediaeval Climping room"" which was very comfortable, particularly enjoyed the open fire in our room. Evening meal was lovely, I especially enjoyed my pear soufflé and the chef put together a vegan menu for my partner, which she really enjoyed. Booked for my partners birthday in December, the hotel still took the time to add extra touches to our stay to mark that, despite it being three months after the event itself. Finally, the staff were great and service was remarkably efficient, and friendly. All in all a perfect stay. More expensive than I have previously paid for an overnight break, but I wouldn't hesitate to go back, it felt special and you couldn't begrudge paying the extra for it.

42,Norfolk Arms,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,11,Nice Hotel but he prepared for early wake up calls ,"I’ve stayed at this hotel several times, it’s local to my work and bang in the middle of Arundel. The hotel itself is fine, the staff friendly, the breakfast always brilliant, BUT... and it’s a big BUT! The last several times I’ve stayed here the fire Alarm has gone off at very unsociable times of the night. Sometimes more than once. When I stay away for work it’s because I need to be fresh the next day & saves me commuting for 2 hours from Bournemouth. I don’t know why the Fire Alarms keep going off, but I always get told by reception when I have a moan “that someone smoked in the room or a shower set it off”. Last night was the same & is probably the final straw for me in terms of staying at the Norfolk Arms.

I’ve never had any offer of compensation on the numerous occasions it has happened & the bigger concern for me now, is that I take it for granted that it’s not an actual fire, I don’t even get out of bed for these alarms. so one day a fire may actually occur and any frequent stayers will probably just ignore it.

Great shame because if it wasn’t for this I’d easily give it a 4 out of 5.

Ordered the “special” pork main course which was tasty but sadly was a very meagre portion size. Served in the centre of a small dinner plate. 3 small discs of the pork, accompanied by one small potato, some red cabbage and some sort of purée smeared on the plate. More like a starter size but at £21 felt it was very mean. Still felt hungry after this course, so decided on a dessert which I am usually too full to order!! Other orders within our party were the steak and a venison stew. Again the stew was a small portion served in a small pot soup toureen type dish with 2 tiny dumplings on top. Not great and my husband was disappointed.

All in all rather a very disappointing dinner but the staff are pleasant which slightly redeemed the evening.

45,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,17,Very disappointing,"We Arrived May half term with my two children aged 11 & 8 to a “New Style Silver Apartment”. This holiday included no meal plans, no additional extras and cost me a few pound shy of £1000. The website explains you can enter the park from 1pm but cannot access your room/apartment until 4pm. We went to our apartment at 4:30 and the cleaners were still in our rooms cleaning. We were self catering so had to ask to put our food we had bought into the fridge, the cleaners allowed us to do this but not without a look of disgust. The apartment was still dirty even after they had left, windows had lipstick on them, glitter all over the chairs dust on the radiators, scum on the backs of the bathroom doors and chunk of plaster missing from one of the door frames. The kitchen was not well equipped; no frying pan, limited kitchen utensils, a tea towel thinner than a muslin, and bowls that were greasy. We had to ask for another towel, the vague looking guest services employee and explained she’d get one to us that afternoon...it never came.

The apartment is ‘rough’ looking, very small, dark and depressing. They’ve crammed bunk beds into one room so that not even the door will open. They’re old apartments attempting to look new but unfortunately failed.

The swimming pool was the BIGGEST let down. It was freezing. It’s newly refurbished and looks fantastic, but the pool temperature is unbearable. The que for some of the slides varied between 30-60minutes. The pool is open to the general public so it gets ridiculously busy and unfortunately for those who have paid for a £1000 holiday have to suffer the consequences. The changing rooms were filthy; the floors covered in mud.

The entertainment in the evening was ok however people using mobility scooters would often block entrances, doorways and fire doors to park them. I don’t believe there are any parking facilities for these. When we asked a member of staff to move the scooters from a fire door he explained “it was not his responsibility”. This was the last straw in an already horrible holiday.

I’d decided on a Butlins break this year instead of a holiday abroad. I thought it would be easier for my family and also saved some pennies. I wish we hadn’t have bothered.

I feel let down, exploited and sad for my family and especially my children. It was a horrible holiday, please don’t waste your money guys, go abroad, Centre parcs, haven...any. Please don’t give your hard earned money to this cruddy establishment.

48,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,6,I’ve just encountered the same issue as the lady below,"Had so many issues on our break it’s been upsetting. And to think my family wanted to join us and go again in the summer holidays. I’ve already told them not to and we won’t be. I’ve stayed at butlins minehead for the past 8 years in a row, this is the first and last trip to Bognor.

After reading someone else just had the same issue I thought I’ll review too. We had some issues before today which were solved at the time (apart from rude staff, handed the right team apparently)
But I’ve just left center stage, we went to watch sleeping beauty and it was very full and we were told by a security man we can sit on the floor, he was nice, I was happy, my 2 kids were happy, we were sat there for 10-15 minutes before a female security guard came up to us and was incredibly rude told us we can’t sit where we were, I asked where am I meant to sit then and she said “no one can sit down due to health and safety. You can stand at the back” she shouted it very rudely and embarrassing in front of so many people. I saw other guests upset by her too.
We looked at the back but nothing can be seen and my toddlers cant stand for that long! I’ve ended up with upset kids who couldn’t see the stage from anywhere so we left before the show even started. I complained to guest services too, just like the woman below, and was fobbed off aswell and told that it’ll be reported to the right team and we can go watch it again at 7:30 tonight. My youngest sleeps by then! Hence why we wanted this show (2pm)
Doesn’t solve it for us does it.. apology would of been nice! Specially when you can tell my daughters got tears in her eyes.

We also queued for over 30 minutes and the queue was right back past the indoor funfair and almost did a whole circle of the skyline. 30 minutes we won’t get back.

After this we have left to go home as this is the 4th time now a member of staff has spoke to us like a piece of dirt.
I don’t care if things are ‘passed on’ to the relevant team... how can this keep happening over and over to so many guests ! Actions speak louder than words. Didn’t solve the tears.

Just thought I would add in that the young bloke who works at the outdoor fun fair on the rides was amazing on our first day. (mid length brown hair and glasses) made my kids super happy when we arrived making the bungee trampoline and helter skelter more fun. Staff like him are a credit to the place and there should be more like him!

The new swimming pool area is over the other side of complex which means having to cross the road to get there. Cars driving round like mad at all hours. While in the pool my partner got metal shavings stick in her foot which we had to pull out Nd causing pool to be closed for 15 minutes while they searched the pool and found more. They them reopened the waves pool which you can imagine was packed solid. The pool is not fit for purpose and such a disappointment from the old pool. Staying in the shoreline hotel (child friendly) the room had wires hanging down with the phone attached. Dangerous for crawling babies.

To think it was the one thing they were looking forward to!!! Butlins.. this pool is for 8yo and below. Nothing for older kids or adults. We loved the OLD POOL with the Big green slide that swooshed you into a deeper pool. The whirling pool with the sit and ride inflatables was awesome in the OLD POOL. In the New Pool we had to queue for 30 mins for a 10sec slide!!! And everywhere you go were toddlers!!!!! Such a shame. For the first time ever our large party is considering an alternative annual Staycation. Haven maybe... or Centre Parcs.

The hotel was chosen after the high down hotel cancelled all their booked weddings and now we are thankful they did, as the reception was Amazing!
Emma organised everything in preparation for the wedding and calmed their nerves and sorted every query quickly and effectively.
Simon the hotel director was on hand through the whole event to ensure everything was going to plan and no issue and everyone was happy.
Steve the duty manager was so friendly and led his team to deliver the wedding breakfast quickly, while it was hot and a very lovely wine with the meal. Unexpected issues were handled seamlessly by the staff.
The food was delicious only small critism was knives need a good sharpen!! Minor point.
The whole day was organised to perfection and flowed seamlessly.
The tap bar is amazing, the knowledge of staff second to none and the gin is fabulous. Again outstanding friendly staff, can't wait to try some more gins soon.
Our room 4 was huge, spotlessly clean and nespeesso machine in addition to kettle, reception more than happy to top up coffee milk etc at no issue.
Bridal suite spotless huge and TV on the bathroom!
It is not an identikit hotel chain, it is old and quirky and the wonky floors are the beauty and charm of the hotel.
Breakfast was plentiful and a nice choice of hot food in addition to the continental selection.
Yes bar prices are high but is a hotel not a pub.

64,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,1,Gets worse every year,"Third year we've been here and got progressively worse each year. Now Butlins is popular again they've given up trying to improve, and it shows. Fewer staff, grubby, no where to park, people smoking in non-smoking areas, queue jumping constantly, throwing dirty nappies on the floor. Butlins seems to bring out the worst in people, generally just couldn't care less about anyone else.

New pool is far too busy with 50min queues for the flumes, and again people just pushing in. Staff could not care less. Wife was told to f-off when she called out a man and his family for doing it. This one incident tells you all you need to know about this place. If you're a half-way decent family, save your money for Center Parcs or go abroad. You won't enjoy it here.

Kids enjoyed it on the whole, but even they got upset at other people's behaviour. New panto is nowhere near last year's standard and Mr Men show was the same as last year. Didn't see any characters walking around. Seems like they've given up.

Wave hotel is looking grubby, in need of some major TLC. Deck restaurant is too busy, food mediocre, floors sticky and men's toilet floor soaked with urine and who knows what else. Has gone down hill massively since we first started coming - no way we'll be back.

65,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,34,A great weekend,"I’ve been to Bognor Regis twice before and I would say it gets better each time I visit.

There was a bit of a hiccup with our accommodation when we arrived. It seemed housekeepers hadn’t cleaned our apartment. However an alternative was quickly found and they gave us vouchers to apologise for the inconvenience.

We stayed in a Seaside apartment. It was clean, loads of room and came with an oven, microwave and fridge. I had previously stayed in a silver apartment, and to be honest they wasn’t a huge amount of difference between them. The seaside apartment was slightly better furnished and used pastel colours to give it a retro beach feel. My only complaint is that they don’t have anywhere for you to hang your wet towels so you ended up putting them over the doors or outside of the window. A clothes horse would easily solve this. We could hear a bit of noise from the people above us however it was bearable (and you expect to hear noise at such a busy time of year).

The splash pool was fantastic. Yes it does get busy so it’s better to get there when the doors open at 9am or late afternoon. The queue for the flume is too long (we had to wait 30 mins for a two minute ride) but there’s loads of other areas - rapids, wave machine, slides - to keep you occupied.

Entertainment is always top notch with loads of choice. There was a massive queue for Stephen Mulhern and we were worried we wouldn’t get a seat but it all turned out fine.

Some of the facilities are looking a bit tired but you can understand that standards can’t be kept top notch during such a busy period. I don’t think I’ve been anyway in he summer hols where it’s looked perfect.

Premium dining was good with a huge choice of food, with some healthy options available.

There’s so much to do, and I think great value for money. My other half had never been before and was impressed. We will be back!

The hotel is near to Arundel and has extensive grounds.

Our room was well equipped but had an extremely noisy creaky floor!

We had several meals during our stay. There was a good selection of typical hot and cold options for breakfast.

However both our evening meals were unacceptable, and lacking In flavour, with over cooked or under cooked elements and the service was extremely slow.

Friday’s buffet was absolutely awful, watery bland ‘curry’, pasta, ‘stroganoff’ and the most basic of salad options and deserts.

Last night’s dinner service took over 3 hours as there were very long waits in between courses so we finished at 2240!! This meant that we lost an hour of our entertainment leaving guests disappointed!

The hotel doesn’t have any lifts which made it difficult with our luggage as we were on the second floor with a lengthy walk to our room (far from ideal for anyone elderly or with health issues).

Several areas are looking rather shabby with maintenance needed, new carpet, paint etc.

The staff were very polite and helpful throughout our stay but clearly just could not cope - there just weren’t enough on duty.

All in all we did not get the standard of stay you would expect of a 4 star hotel so feel disappointed.

They food in the deck was good quality and plenty of choice and my only negative here was that quite often a certain dish would run out and it would take a long time to refresh it.
The entertainment was superb but I noticed that it didn’t seem that there were so many red coats about as normal.
Finally the new pool was superb and would recommend although if you are a serious swimmer then don’t bother as this is a fun pool. The slides are great and were not too busy and the changing rooms were big and plentiful.
Overall I thought our stay was great as usual but be carful Butlins as I got a sense you are tightening the purse strings in certain areas in order to fund the new pool and refurbishments and as a regular I noticed.

Our food had not been prepared and were offered a free drink.

I don’t normally leave feedback apart from when the food and restaurant is exceptionally good, but on this occasion due to the low standard and disappointing meal I feel that this needs doing, not sure if this is your normal standard but we were all very disappointed.

My room, a single, was clean and well appointed, although the pillows were rather uncomfortable - one was very thin and they were both a bit hard. A fan had thoughtfully been provided to deal with the extremely hot weather. The problem with the breakfast was that the ""vegetarian sausage"" was in fact a roll of mashed potato and carrot pieces, rather than a Quorn or soya or even seitan substitute. As the vegetarian breakfast came with hash browns but only one poached egg, this made it very potato-heavy and protein-light. (The standard ""full English"" has both sausages and bacon.)

For a starter I had calamari - the best I can remember - cooked in a light fresh batter. If you've been shunning this dish of late because it always tastes and feels like tough rubber, then please give it another chance here. It was faultless. To follow I chose the fish of the day - a fillet of sea bass. It was perfectly cooked and served on a bed of french beans and asparagus. Upon request a few saute potatoes were added to augment the dish. For pudding I had one of three homemade fruit pies on offer, served with ice cream or cream. To accompany the fish I had a glass of Sicilian dry white wine., which had lots of flavour and no harshness.
All-in-all it was a fabulous, tasty meal - leaving one feel nicely fed but not stuffed - and all for a very reasonable price. The quality of the cuisine could have come from a kitchen charging 50% more - if indeed you can find it.

When I spoke to the duty manager she was ambivalent about the fact we felt the room was over priced and implied that we should have asked to be in the main building even though we were unaware of the existence of the annexe.
On the following Monday we stayed at The Spread Eagle hotel in Midhurst and we were on a room and dinner deal that was the same price as the Norfolk Arms room only and that was a lovely experience, we will not be returning to the Norfolk.

Unfortunately we walked into what I can only describe as very clicky locals sitting and judging at the bar (I LOVE going to a pub with welcoming locals which I expected but unfortunately this was not the case) and not one greeting from the staff. The first word which was said to us by an older lady was ""please can you leave and take your boots off, you're making my carpets dirty"" no 'hello, how can we help' or anything. I'm completely understanding about the removal of boots when dirty but no dirt was on our boots and quite frankly her attitude stank. I've been the owner of five successful pubs in Sussex and if a bit of mud on a carpet in a COUNTRY pub is an issue then they need a rethink or learn that sometimes mess does happen but a hoover or dust pan and brush can be a quick fix.

Now this again is fine but when I told the lady that I was indeed 22 and had been here many times and I wasn’t drinking and also having a meal here I got the foulest response saying that I still need to be ID which wouldn’t have been the issue.

I recommend ordering a kids burger instead of an adult one as you get more for your money on a kids meal.

133,Arundel Castle,Attractions,Arundel,Historical/Culture,43,This is the real thing,"The other reviewers say it all. This castle and beautiful little town deserve the planning that it takes to get here. Arundel is a slightly out of the way village. That's good, as you don't want huge tourist crowds anyway. I had only time for the cheaper ticket, chapel and gardens plus entry to the shop and cafe. Those indoor areas give you some idea of the grandeur of the placce. The chapel is truly ancient and to me it did feel........ Well, awesome. The gardens are magnificent on a clear day. Huge stone walls surround them. Check the website as the castle has a long off season and is closed from autumn through to spring. It is still a family home, nothing like a ruin. You need plenty of time to see it to good effect. You would be disappointed if you set only 2 hours aside, that isn't really enough time for the whole thing. Take a small picnic to the gardens if you want, not a huge basket as you may have to leave that at security. Outside the castle the Arun River is nearby, where you will often see real white swans. Further up the road is a kind of Wetlands park, not cheap but it's supposed to be excellent for kids, and if you keep going, in under 15 mins you will get to a pretty lake with some nice walking behind it. It's just a pity that all accommodation for miles around is so expensive. Still, you can make it a day out, travelling from a hostel in Brighton.

Was told it was £14 and given the time of 2pm. At no time was I informed there was a ""carvery system"" and now wish I had looked on here and read Helen of Brighton's review of the 18th August. First off they said they could not find my reservation in the book then someone had a look and found it! Told them we wanted the carvery but waitress said she would put our name down for it?? meantime get our drinks. 30mins later still no news re carvery yet see people coming back with food from there (remember we did not know about the carvery system then), asked waitress again how long it was going to be and she said she did not know! Err what about going and finding out for the customer! I had not opened my bottle of drink and we decided to leave then without eating as could see this was going nowhere and it was getting late for lunch, went up to pay for partner's bottle of drink which had been opened and half-emptied (both soft drinks, not that that matters), they then tried to charge me for both, said I was not paying for mine as I had not opened it and had wanted it with my dinner which did not seem to be coming - we had pre-ordered carvery on the previous Thursday and no mention made of their carvery system to which man on duty at counter said he only works weekends! No appologies made whatsoever. This establishment might look the part, but needs vast improvement on customer service, safety, eye sight tests/reading classes and their so called carvery system (never ever come across this before) which I was informed was due to being in a small area with too many people going up and live flames of candles there ... HEALTH & SAFETY is this safe with young children around? Lit candles on all tables, as a family eatery would be safer for battery candles hence still look the part. Our table also was sticky - needs to be spray cleaned after every use, simply health and safety requirements. We really had been looking forward to this but still got our Sunday roast.... further down the road at the Swan... no ""carvery system"" there, and meal was delicious and cheaper!

On complaining the receptionist said we were never going to be together as they do not have two 6 person rooms together so we were mislead on booking. She said she would listen to the taped conversation to see what Butlins had said and call us back, still waiting.

Room block 4 floor was filthy and there were no shelf’s in the oven, shower head kept falling of.
Room block 5 floor was also filthy and all our pans etc had not been washed. Lots of cigarette buts out side our room which kept getting walked in. Was told they would be cleared up but never was.
A cleaner did come over and clean the rest of stuff that we hadn’t finished cleaning on arrival.

Wanted to hire the bikes out, but apparently they do not hire them adults only week ??
The fair was not open either.

We all paid to have a spa, the changing rooms had two toilets and two showers no changing separate room which is uncomfortable if you don’t wish to get changed in front of anybody, we were all queuing for a shower.
The main changing room was very small and hot, very uncomfortable considering you should be relaxing.
The spa itself seem to have to many people in at once. It was over an hour before any of us could use the hot tub also the ice room was broke.
I did have a facial and that was very good.

The two Ploughmans however, were fine, nice big pieces of cheese. But the 'piece de resistance' was the treacle tart. Yes I am joking. There was no treacle in the treacle tart. It was just pastry that stuck in the throat. Inedible and most of it was left. We did complain, but it seemed to fall on deaf ears.

We were greeted by Ray who is on the security gate as you enter, very nice chap who made us very welcome. The check in staff were very professional and polite.
When I booked the holiday I upgraded to a comfort plus caravan and we were extremely happy with it as it had multi room heating, as the weather was very cold this was a bonus. We were in Ballast Rise which isn’t too far away from the entertainment and swimming pool etc so it was a nice short walk to get there.
Our only gripe when we entered the van was that the cleaners hadn’t hoovered the floor and dining benches and they were covered in bread crumbs.
We were given a three bedded caravan and this was very welcome as when we hired a high chair for my friends little toddler the very helpful chap that bought it along didn’t hesitate when I asked if he could move the single beds in one of the rooms so we could place the travel cot in there.
You will need to bring your own cleaning products i.e washing up liquid, washing up sponges and tea towels and oven gloves. There’s lots of cutlery, utensils and crockery supplied though. Nice big TV too.
The park is very well maintained, we loved the indoor swimming pool, the amusement arcade and soft play area was such fun for the little one. There is a restaurant called Mash and Barrel which we ate in one afternoon, the food was really good. There is a shop on site too, but further down the road is a local Tesco express and near the seafront is a CoOp.
We also used the local Chinese takeaway along the road just about a one minute drive from the site called Jasmines, very good food.

177,"Crossbush, Beefeater",Food,Arundel, Steakhouse/Diner,94,Overpriced Xmas dinner - couldn’t fault the staff! ,"So we booked Xmas dinner here for 4 adults & 1 child, were met by cheery staff whom I’m
Sure would rather have been elsewhere on Xmas day.
The meal was expensive at almost £60 a person and didn’t even include any drink.
I just hope at that price that the company that own the Beefeater pay their staff handsomely for working this day and don’t leave them to rely on tips!

So the meal was a bit of a mix - my starter of a soufflé came out cold in the middle.
On our main courses I paid extra for cauliflower cheese and also one tiny Yorkshire pud and a few small sausages - a bit rich considering they missed off the carrot mash that was advertised on all our meals- I don’t know if this was a genuine error but none of us had this on our plates!
No biggie but when you charge £3 for some cauliflower cheese but don’t even bother putting the advertised menu on the plate then it kind of sticks in your throat!

As with another reviewer we also opted for the chocolate bombs and although we ate earlier around 12.30 we had the same issue.
The bomb didn’t melt because the sauce wasn’t even hot!
If this was a normal day then I’d say the amount we paid £260 (just for the food) was an utter rip off - sadly you’re not paying for the food or even the quality of the food - you’re paying for the day you eat, however with that said it would of been nice if you actually got what you paid for!
The veggie roast I have to say was delicious, actually the saving grace of the meal.
The staff I couldn’t fault, the service was great and they were all very happy and polite.

I was traveling from wales for a family funeral and asked if I could check in early. I didn’t hear anything back until 24 hrs later saying I could but at an extra cost of £20.

I declined this and said I would review this service once I return home from my trip.

The room I stayed in was room 11. This was at the top of the hotel in what felt like the furthest corner. The hotel had a funny smell which wasn’t very pleasant.

The room was ok but you could tell that it needed some work with it- bath had a hole in that looked like it was filled in with some putty. The paint was knocked and chipped away. I was rather disappointed and felt I would’ve been better off at a local travel lodge.

The hotel was dead and it felt like I was the only person in it- no offer for upgrade like most hotels would offer. I felt like the hotel cared more about the money than customer service and experience.

The food did smell nice but due to poor experience from start I ended up going to local competition which I was glad of.

I spoke to family who live in area and they laughed at me when I said I was staying in this hotel- they advised its been going backwards in recent years.

Say the least...I won’t be coming back.

Don't be fooled by the term 'beach hut' - these are not what you would imagine! They have rainfall showers, a lounge area with bifold doors that open out onto a balcony with views straight out over the sea, and a lovey mezzanine bedroom with Egyptian cotton bed linen. The lounge area is beautiful and has a tv, fridge - stocked with complimentary Coke, milk, water and wine, coffee machine and tea making facilities, games and a very comfortable settee. There is also a decanter in the lounge containing complimentary sloe gin. The bathroom has a rainfall/power shower, complimentary toiletries, shaver point, toilet, heated towel rail and basin all completed to a high standard. There is a children's bedroom which we didn't use but it looked very comfortable. The mezzanine bedroom has a king size bed which was so so comfortable, a built in wardrobe and also a tv. You can sit on the bed and look out through the bifold doors and see the view over the beach. The balcony/terrace outside the lounge has teak chairs with foot stalls which you can slide together to make a sun lounger. We sat there in the evening sun and felt we could have been on holiday anywhere! Although we missed breakfast the following day we had a beautiful three course meal in the evening in the hotel restaurant where the staff were very attentive but not overwhelming. Looking forward to our next visit to this little oasis by the sea.

The rooms were in poor state of decoration and cleanliness (see pictures). On arrival people with the same surnames and room types were allocated rooms on the opposite site of the hotel to each other where common sense would suggest that they would want to be close to each other. Rooms for disabled people were at the bottom of the garden in an annex a short drive away? That said the food was good and catering/bar staff tried hard to impress and the events manager on the Saturday night was awesome, even tricky problems that were not under his control he took on and sorted them. In summary good staff except the lack of common sense on room allocation but the venue is tired and needs a refurbishment which is a shame as the location opens up great potential.

207,White Swan Arundel,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,0,Disgraceful,"We went to the White Swan last Sunday as a family, the meal went ok until we ordered the dairy free icecream for my 2 year old son as he has several severe allergies - the menu didn't say this contained nuts nor was this pointed out to us. My 2 year old went into anaphylactic shock and an ambulance had to be called. At this point we were tried to be moved to a private room several times, my cynical side believes perhaps to move us out of the way. Whilst waiting for the ambulance we were also charged for the meal before being blue lighted to hospital and spending 12 hours there. The manager was meant to call us to see how my son was, they didn't. When we called them, they told us they are fully compliant with any laws as they had an allergy matrix, which at no point was given to us. They have promised to change the wording on the menus and that they are legally compliant but we will be making sure with further advice.
When I pointed out to the manager that taking payment was at least distasteful at that time as we were fully distracted they have just posted us details of receipts so we can check them - at which point they pointed out that the ice cream ordered wa dairy free (even tho the issue is with the cashew nuts)! they have also charged us for the icecream that had a bite taken and put my son in hospital. We feel we are fair and have raised points directly before writing any reviews but i just feel the lack of customer service and respect here has been appalling and I fear for what could have happened.

Lunch option very poor, basically it was 4 choices of salads or sandwiches and sweet. Meal service very slow with little enthusiasm from the waitress.

Though smaller than Alnwick it certainly competes. Perhaps the Duke should organise conversion of the raised bank across the drive from the formal gardens into a'Potager garden' - then he would certainly be giving Rosemoor a run for its money.
The castle itself, including the keep with its displays, will take a couple of hours or more to appreciate and are worth spending time in, whilst the small restaurant serves good food and the design of the tables and chairs are unique to the place.

Also nearby were Costas, mc Donald's, burger king and pizza hut. As well as tescos and sainsbury's superstores. Both swimming pools were really warm and plenty of lifeguards. It got busy but not intolerably so. The outdoor paddling pool was freezing, but it made little difference to the children who were happy in the big pools. The evening entertainment was fun and not too long. There was a nice play area and a small stream with ducks. There are plenty of activities for the children onsite if you want to fill their day, but as we wanted a simple and relaxing break, this was perfect. The rest of my family came down for the day and only had to pay £5 each for the use of the pools.

I have wrote to butlins head office several times about the incident and they have just completely lied about the situation and trying to blame my child when she wasn't at fault at all
 the staff member didnt tell my daughter to move away they just come along and slammed the hot plate down and was obliviousy that they had even burnt my daughter
I never at any point shouted that My daughter got burnt
My daughter wasn't on her own I was there with her the whole time and we was there before the staff member came along that slammed the hot plate down
we had to wait for first aider in restaurant and they told us to take my daughter upstairs for a Luke warm bath which we did
 sounds like they are trying to cover there tracks and put the blame on a small child it's disgusting I'm so angry
I think the replies from a big company like this are disgusting they are supposed to be a child friendly resort and they just don't care they have listened to what the staff have told them and only are believing what they have told them which are all lies
But everything I have told them isn't right too them

It ends with a gorilla coming out and then chasing the hosts through a door where they could be heard screaming as they are being attacked. Before each venomous creature comes on there’s a rather loud scary alarm that goes off which freaked my daughter out each time it came on. Obviously it’s not real but my daughter was absolutely terrified and was screaming and crying, she was traumatised. There were a lot of kids there who were also screaming and sobbing and trying to hide from it all.
I went to complain to the staff after who were not at all bothered by the sight of my sobbing and traumatised daughter. I got told lots of kids love it and it does state not suitable for under 5’s. But if I had any idea it was about dangerous and venomous creatures I’d never have taken my daughter in. It’s not suitable for kids at all, it’s frightening and unnecessary. They could have made it into a lovely film about animals and been educational too. But the aim is to absolutely terrify children. You have been warned.

Once we were seated, my partner had seen that there was only 1 vegetarian option available on the Mains section, which she did not want, and preferred to not eat anything. This was because, I asked a passing waitress if there were any vegetarian options, and that was the only one available. I understand that it was Father’s Day and it was most likely a temporary set menu. However, when it states on trip advisor itself that it’s vegetarian friendly, we didn’t expect that. More to the point, we asked if we’d like to order by the waitress, and we asked for a few more minutes. The landlady Tracey came over to take our order. Myself, my partners brother and dad wanted to order and not my partner as mentioned. However, Tracey said something along the lines of “ i can’t have a table for four people, only ordering three meals and two drinks”. This came across very rudely, and we were speechless. Our response was, that there were limited vegetarian options and my partner didn’t want what was offered on that menu. Tracey suggested something off of the starter menu, minus the cheese because my partner cannot have cheese, insisting she orders something, again coming across very aggressive this time. Anyhow, the offer was refused, and Tracey said she’ll just put the order through and snatched the menus from the table. After discussing what just happened, we decided to leave and take our custom elsewhere. As we were we leaving, we told the waitress why. (Because of the poor service) and left with Tracey, hearing and asking if we were going to pay for the drinks, that we already bought at the bar, in which she served us. Also, over £9.00 for 2 pints, definitely over charged? Given my partners family is from Eastern Europe, I’d assume she is a xenophobe. Because, why was everyone else served in such a warm and great manner?",1,2.0,2.0,British,1

Very poor sound insulation and very noisy guests.

From 11.30pm to 1.30am adults shouting, swearing, kids screaming. While we expected some noise, the amount of noisy adults, kids, TVs and lack of sound insulation is just horrendous.

You can hear neighbours TV and conversation very clearly up until 1.15am and again when they are up at 7am. The other neighbour played drum and bass until 1am. The effect of security coming is only temporary. We can hear our neighbours in all of our rooms (two bedrooms and bathroom).

Impossible to get decent sleep or even sleep in.

Oyster bay consists of very long rows of run-down flats with very large ""fish bowl""window. You""ll need to keep the curtains closed though as multiple other residents walk right past the windows. The upper walkways aren't level and there are many cracks, it doesn't look or feel safe. The flats opposite are really close adding to noise issues.

All-in all,the noisy accommodation and lack of sleep is ruining the holiday.

Think very carefully before booking Oyster Bay.

We tried moving but site full. Considering leaving but paid £600 for 3 nights.

Butlins should show photos of the outside of these flats. We would never have gone.

Of course people will find fault but often this is easily resolved by asking for help and not taking to social media to give negative reviews.
Yes silver accommodation isn’t as luxury as the Wave hotel but you know that before you book and by the price.
There’s always early bird booking on resort offers and this week there’s 40% off next year!
The shows are world class for a resort like this and the Funfair is always great I love the hook a duck with great team, loads of different colored ducks and so many prizes to choose from for our 3 year old.
There can be up to 5000 people on this resort at any one time so things can go wrong but in our experience if you have a genuine grievance they will go way beyond what’s deemed as fair to rectify it.
The new splash pool is fabulous obviously it’s not for Olympic swimmers it’s just as it should be ‘family orientated’.
We’re here now for Halloween and it’s been themed and the face painting stall do some fabulous scary faces. We’re back for Christmas when once again it’s themed and fake snow everywhere. Thank you Butlins we love you.

On Butlin's dine around package and the wife only wanted a small pizza.

Waitress: No madam you can only have a medium pizza on dinearound.

Me: No No the wife won’t eat all a Medium pizza, a small will just be fine otherwise it’s a waste of food.

Waitress: No you MUST have a medium.

Me: No No you have a corporate responsibility not to waste food we will only have a small.

At which point the waitress stormed off without taking our order and shouted after the manager in a hissy fit. No I will be back in a minute Sir or let me check with the manager Sir. Just a full on childish tantrum from the waitress.

All for asking for less food for the money we are paying. There are people in this world that can’t afford to eat and this waitress wants to just waste food and throw tantrums. Where is your CSR policy papa Johns/Butlins. The waitress then refused to serve us for the rest of the meal, most likely due to her own embarrassment. No apology given for her utter childish performance.

We managed to get the reduced small size meal for the price of a medium in the end and the remainder of staff/Manager were very attentive.

Are we glad we did!! The grounds with all the tulips were stunning with all the flowers in splendid bloom.

We were then inspired to visit the Fitzalan church and then the castle itself. What a treasure that is, although if you want to see it all, be warned that there is some climbing involved. But again, the whole visit was well worth the effort.

Selected delivery time between 6pm to 6.30pm which included a £1.00 delivery for some reason, the website says free delivery for orders over £18. Come 6.30pm it still hadn’t arrived so gave them a call. Not ready they said. Probably another 15 minutes. We weren’t impressed so said we would go and collect. On arrival at the shop we were told it still wasn’t ready so we waited patiently. After another 10 minutes I insisted on collecting the food. Again told that it wasn’t ready and would we like free drinks while waiting. Absolutely not. At this point I said don’t bother and I wanted a refund. Nobody knew what to do including the manager who made an appearance with our food. Again I declined the food and insisted on a refund. To rub salt in to the wound he said I had to ring a number to get a refund as he didn’t know how to do it! Miraculously, on advising him that I would be happy to take cash, he denied having any cash in the till, then proceeded to pick up the card terminal and process my refund!!! I collected the money to my card and advised him to enjoy the food they had taken an hour and a half to cook!! Never again -I have a life to live !!!",1,2.0,2.0,Indian,1
335,Church Farm,Accommodation,Littlehampton,AccomOther,18,Half Term Break Site Complex not big enough for amount of vans,"went here 25th-29th Oct
for me last bust weekend of the year for most sites but right from the off this site felt like it was on a shutdown and did not feel vet haven like
arrived security staff as one of only a few plus points
check in ok found caravan ok the site is very clean reported on the way back to complex our outside light not working was logged still waiting now( not really now been back over a week or so) but first time we has this at Haven
went to bar to get food I must say service was fast and good food still think the choice should be maybe a bit more wider
Bar/Resturant size was good and was arcade but that's were it stops
Main entertainment hall far to small for amount of people the site can hold we thought once bingo finished quite a few would leave
nope it was like the OK CORAL trying to gets seats lots of hassle which put a bit of a downer on it as my child like the kids shows
queue for bar was a joke think the staff were on holiday already
we left after an hour was mayhem
so I thought next day go bit earlier to get a seat even worse just not enough room I seen bigger halls at smaller parks
last night I went over an hour before to get a good seat to be meet by queue of children put there by the adults while the drunk at the bar come 5 mins to open time there all barged in which nearly ended in a fight no security to be seen
so I know this is near end of season but HT is always busy
Pros
Good fast food service in restaurant and bar
Nice staff in there
Caravan and park clean
Cons
Poor no show on reported light
lack of bar staff in main hall( not everyone lives for bingo)
Main hall fair to small also complex being right near main gate and main road bit iffy

She said that is the house wine so I asked to change it for another same priced wine. She checked with her supervisor who said “ you have had some of it so I can’t do anything with it”. I said I had tasted it, otherwise I would not have complained but Supervisor insisted she can’t change it as I have tasted it. WHAT! How can you complain about a wine if you haven’t tasted it?

The Castle hold events through out the year where families are encouraged to learn and interact with re enactors who bring history from past years to life. My godson of 8 years old had a fabulous time. He loved holding a sword and trying on some of the knights armour. We watched as the knights battled and the archers fired their arrows, he even had a go at archery himself. There was also a brilliant Birds of Prey display when we were there too. The castle grounds are beautiful and are very well kept. Inside the castle you can smell the history as you walk back in time. There are also many helpful guides on hand that can educate and show you all the wonders that the Castle has to offer.
I highly recommend Arundel castle as a family day out as it has so much to offer.

355,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,13,Don’t waste your money! ,"Came to Butlin’s as a family of 3 for a weekend trip. We stayed in Oyster Bay. We didn’t have high expectations as we had picked the budget accommodation as we felt the hotels were way over priced for a 3 night non peak break. The rooms are very basic, they do have everything you need but it’s all very old. We were in an end room felt like a fish bowl as all windows are over looked. If your not a fan of natural light and enjoy being watched from all angles this is the place for you. The bed was comfy, on arrival it was broken one side. Staff came around to check on all rooms which was great. Our bed was fixed quickly. The whole apartment was cleanish! The noise levels are a lot though! Walls are cardboard thin so even if neighbours are quiet you can hear it all. Best part was the stairs.... it was incredible made the whole apartment turn into a bouncy castle/trampoline/waterbed experience. Whenever anyone walked up the stairs and hit the landing jumping or not you move with them!
They need to put signs up to remind people that at 11pm some younger children still like to sleep!
The whole park is good but not great. Aimed at younger children around 8. Not much for teenagers. The staff are doing their best but you can see considerable cut backs. The fair ground only has a handful of rides so you can spend more then an hour there. The bigger more exciting drawing you in type rides are charged. And on the expensive side. As is golf, bowling, driving school - all paid for attractions.
Mirroring what other reviews have said nothing is open before 10 attraction wises and lots of the restaurants and ice cream place don’t open til 12.
Scoop the ice cream place is worth a visit. One big bonus of the site.
We booked and visited the diner on Saturday evening. This place is a joke. We waited over an hour for our food. Took 20mins after being seated for our drinks ordered to be taken and then another long wait of 15 mins for our food order to be taken. Then had an hour wait. Which would be expected but there was more empty tables then full ones. Another table walked out as it took so long. We complained and our food order was chased but still didn’t speed up the food process. Staff were apologetic but it took them a long while to come over. Not worth it go to burger kind instead!
The pool is the main attraction, it’s very new and is great. The rapids are fun but only if your children can swim. The changing rooms are disgusting! And very unsanitary. Be prepared to queue for everything.
Staff at evening shows are great though.
Very mixed bag even for a cheap weekend away with the kids, it’s not worth it at all. Another once great historical thing going down the drain! Try haven or dare I say pontins instead!

360,Spice Paradise,Food,Bognor, Restaurant,6,Slop in a bowl and frozen packet veg.,"Absolute slop, poor quality food, cheap frozen ingredients. We waited so long for our food we actually thought it was going to be freshly cooked. This meal was a huge disappointment and a waste of time and money.

I ordered sag paneer - which is supposed to be cubes of cheese and spinach with cream, coconut and spices. What was actually served was dire. It was made with normal cheese which melted, so was mushy, with no flavour, at all, (no spices were added) a ton of cream and spinach. I only ate a very small amount, because it was so awful. I have never had sag paneer made with normal cheese, I tried it and regretted it - normal cheese in sag paneer is wrong and lazy.

I also ordered a side of vegetable curry. What I actually got was a bowl of frozen veg - peas, green beans, carrots in what I can only describe as slop. It looked like soup made with frozen veg. I sent that back and they offered a replacement. I declined.

My friend ordered a vegetable shashlic and that was slightly better, because it didn't look like soup and had a bit more flavour. Considering the cost to make with fresh vegetables, it was shocking to see most of ingredients were still obviously from a frozen packet.

(No Quorn curry on offer, which most good restaurants now serve for veggie customers).

The nan was great, perfect.

The rice was ok, hard to get that wrong.

My friends had chicken curry and that looked edible, they said it was 'OK', nothing special.

The bill for the 4 of us was £70 which was shocking for the quality of food we were served. Complete waste of money and our time and we were all really disappointed.

The Korma ... Oh my, where to begin ?? Opened the container lid to reveal a globulous grey sludge with a watery yogurt poured over the top. The taste was indescribable - overly sweet and not remotely anything like a standard, creamy Korma. Again the chicken was tyre worthy.

Looking over the lovely fields to Arundel Castle, it’s decor is very calming and you feel relaxed as soon as you step foot in there.
Breakfast is fantastic. With a good choice, of fresh fruits, yoghurts and cereals, and a lovey cooked English Breakfast, who could ask for more. We have already booked for next year, and can’t wait to return, would recommend to everyone to enjoy a stay there.

381,Burger King,Food,Bognor, Fast Food/Takeaway,34,Oh dear!,"I have never had a greasy burger from a Burger King before but today was the day. The turn around service is the fastest I have ever seen. The choice of drink from the vending machine promises a wide and varied range but in reality- limited to Coke Cola, Fanta and Cloudy Lemonade. When I informed the member of staff, although acknowledged there was no action to rectify and refresh.
The staff were totally miserable and distant, if the person who served us cracked a smile they would need to reapply their makeup.
Dirty, unappetizing and resembling another fast food outlet.
Shame really as we had travelled 6 miles to have one as there is not a Burger King where we live. Oh well, at least it gives me the incentive to make my own.

382,Bailiffscourt Spa,Attractions,Littlehampton,Spas/Leisure Centres,0,Disappointing,"I visited here with a friend for a well earned spa day. Spa treatments were lovely and well administered. The pool and facilities are available to hotel and members to use. Although the pools were pretty empty, there were not enough beds to go round and we had to share a bed as did others.
 From arrival to Lunch was 5 hours, which we knew when we booked. On arrival there was a machine upstairs to make your own tea or coffee. We were told snacks were available during the morning but were not. In the end we had to ask and were told only biscuits were available which we gladly accepted. All food and drink is taken in the lounge which is upstairs, so we were up and down several times.
Cream tea was included in our package but was inedible, with the scones being bitter to taste and of a sand like texture. We reported this to reception and were told they would be taken back to the kitchen , we were offered a soft drink as recompense but declined. We aware also told the hotel would be in contact regarding this but they never did.
I wouldn't s place unless you just want a massage and a quick swim but a £160 it is a waste of money

I don’t use the swimming pool because the changing facilities are dirty. It seems that nothing here ever really gets updated or refurbished despite the expensive membership cost. There’s a class I regularly attend where the music always breaks because there’s something wrong with the aux connection or speakers, every week the centre claims it has been fixed and every week it doesn’t work. The range of classes is poor for the membership price, the only thing I like about the classes is that the instructors are great. In the gym, the hand towel dispensers are constantly empty and so is the hand soap in the toilets. I don’t think that there is a great range of machines in the gym and some of them break repeatedly and obviously need replacing.I think that for the price of the membership I would expect more facilities, more classes, for broken things to be properly fixed or replaced, for more refurbishments to be made and at the very least for everything to be cleaner and hand towels refilled. I often see members of staff cleaning machines in the gym but ignoring that all the dispensers are empty.The thing that really pushed me into writing a negative review is that this week the centre has been constantly been smelling overwhelmingly like people’s private parts!

The chef at the shoreline hotel was also the same, he was happy to cook my meal separate so that it was safe for me to eat - was amazing to feel like I could be on holiday and not have to take my own food.

Walked in liked the interior airy bright so forth. Ordered drinks no problem. Asked for table barman said the restaurant manager would come to take us to table, no one appeared for 1-0 mins or more and then it was the barman who served us in the beginning. Shown to table but was able to choose as quiet. Lovely waitress very pleasant and friendly selected seats sat down. Went through the menu and thought we would go for the steak as again not had for a long time in England, this was £20.00 plus. Probably about a 30 minute wait you had to purchase mushrooms and sauce extra. No offer of any vegetables or salad. On plate looked reasonable enough apart from no colour, a few peas would have made all the difference and a grilled tomato. Anyhow we both had ordered steak medium. which to me has always been cooked on outside but still pale pink and juicy in the middle. When we both cut into the meat it was dry and clearly overcooked. it tasted to me ok but to my husband who hates anything chewy he was not pleased. He sat there complaining so I said we need to say something which we did,. Spoke to the really lovely waitress who went back to the kitchen and did offer for 2 more steaks to be cooked but at this stage my husband was rather peeved!! He did think of switching to steak and ale pie and the girl said there no Gravy!! How can you run a restaurant and have no gravy??? Oh and before that when we ordered another drink the girl came up with mine and said they had run out of ICE. Again these are surely the basics how embarrassing for the staff. Needless to say we just paid for our drinks and left quite hungry. Stopped at chippy on the way home. Never looked so smart when eating a chip butty.

Couldn’t fault Butlins - only gripe is selfish guests smoking all over the place. It really annoys me when they can’t stick to the smoking areas which are all over the resort. Not sure if this could be policed more by Butlins staff?

429,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,77,Just for Tots Sept 2019,"We booked a break through Sun holidays for the Just for Tots midweek break, choosing a standard apartment as wanted to predominantly self cater to save money. There’s a supermarket onsite which stocks most things (at slightly inflated prices but generally the norm for most things) but we mainly brought stuff for quick meals with us.

We were located in the fourth row in Oyster Bay, Guillemont, pretty close to the Skyline complex which was great. Could pop back easily for lunch etc. The accommodation is very tired however was clean and comfortable enough for 2 adults and toddler. We had ground floor which was great for access with pram and luggage, however, if you’re a light sleeper, would recommend ear plugs as the noise travels, the family above us were stomping around early in morning and late at night, thankfully we were tired enough it didn’t affect us too much. Single glazed windows didn’t help the noise but electric heaters in rooms helped keep us comfortable. The parking is on the far side of the resort so was up to my husband to lug 2 trolley loads of luggage across the resort in the pouring rain on the first day - pretty miserable start!

In apartment, you get an electric hob, oven (no baking trays though so had to put foil on shelf), pans, frying pan, jug etc, kettle, toaster and we had a small fridge and freezer compartment. No bottle opener, blunt knives etc so would recommend bringing these, and a non stick pan! No microwave, and for £15 to hire, we didn’t bother and made do with the hob. You get a pack with tea towel, washing up liquid, sponge and cloth, loo roll and tea, coffee, sugar and uht milk portions. Bath mat but no towels, also sign to say you can request non slip rubber bath mat if needed (we took one anyway)

Problem with electrical sockets though - there’s only one socket in kitchen which we had to swap kettle/toaster/chargers etc so would recommend an extension lead or block. There’s another single socket by dining table too, none in twin bedroom (that we could find, so had to use an extension from hallway socket for baby monitor etc).

Didn’t pay for linen but got this supplied anyway which helped. Got a travel cot in fine in twin room between beds and put our groblind on window too to prevent early starts!

Entertainment was great, enough shows with Teletubbies and puppet shows during day as well as quieter activities (little tikes toys in pavilion studio, play doh in promenade studio or library in skyline tent) too to keep toddler entertained around naps. Under 5s fairground nice and quiet after first day rush too, often only one on the rides in afternoon. Too small for outdoor fairground rides, had fun in play park, and garden near one of the hotels with sand in. Was a bit restless by main evening events at 7pm though which was a bit tedious, especially when queuing for Justin etc (we did pay for B-line passes which saved a lot of queuing in evening however still joined about halfway down Bline queue at 5.25pm for Justin - did get second row though). Justin and Paddington shows great, Dave Benson Phillips (mainly for the adults I think!) was OK, Sids show wasn’t great though in my opinion, toddler was bored. Drinks ok prices, 50p for lime and soda so stuck to that!

Short 10/15min walk into town with pubs, high street shops and Morrison’s too, pebbled/sandy beach too. Had cheap lunch in Wetherspoons one day for change of scenery.

New pool is great for little ones, although a little on the cool side, just watch out for the tiles down into the wave pool (my little one slipped twice and saw other kids slip too) and in the changing room - take care! Need £1 for lockers, would be good if advertised as caught us out first time.

Ended up packing up Thursday day and leaving after Justin - there didn’t look to be much on on Friday and we were ready for our own beds by then. Drop boxes at exit for key cards so checkout nice and easy.

We got a nice cheap holiday though Sun but probably would’ve been a little disappointed if had paid more. Heard some people complaining about rooms and food plans etc, so glad we had mainly self catered.

430,Inglenook,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,18,The Friendliest Hotel in Pagham,"We checked into this little gem of a Hotel after finding it on Booking.com and we were not disappointed. Having onsite parking is also a bonus.

From the first moment we entered the hotel we were greeted with friendly faces and extremely helpful staff. Dot on reception even helped me up the stairs with my suitcase she’s an absolute star with the friendliest smile.

We had a twin room which had everything we needed, including biscuits on the Tea and coffee tray (which my granddaughter immediately ate🤦🏼‍♀️).

We unpacked our suitcases and decided to explore the Hotel grounds, the grounds are very well maintained and there’s a lovely pond in the garden and a children’s play house, there’s also lots of comfortable seating to sit and relax on.

That evening we ventured down to the in-house restaurant which has Al a Carte as well as a pub menu, we tried both and were not disappointed the food is to a very high standard. We were served by Paige and Olivia who couldn’t do enough for us, very warm friendly and welcoming.

After dinner we sat in the garden were I drank a lovely cup of coffee that was brought out to me by Paige whilst we relaxed in the peaceful surroundings.

The beds in our room where so comfortable we slept so well, we had breakfast included in our stay so in the morning we headed down to the restaurant to be greeted with yet more smiles welcoming us in. The breakfast was also to a very high standard.

There’s also a resident parrot in the restaurant called Nicky who we were told is 60 years old... he wasn’t very chatty but Scarlett loved saying good morning to him.

All in all we’ve had an amazing time so it’s a very big thankyou from us to Dot, Rachel, Paige, Olivia and the lovely Housekeeping ladies for making our stay so memorable.

You run a lovely Hotel Edna, we will definitely be back soon.

Hardly any activities put on. New pool is a let down.. for tiny little kids and rules as per usual ruin any fun. My advice, for £100 more i could have gone to centre parcs with great pool and their rules are much more relaxed and fun. Much better equipped accommodation too... we had hardly nothing we needed in our seaside apartment and when we requested an ironing board we got this... see picture... says it all doesn't it!! 😂

435,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,11,Awful stay,"I booked a 4 night break to Butlins in Bognor Regis for my son’s 2nd birthday. We arrived on Monday 10th June to find there was no entrance for those on foot (we travelled by train) we then had to stand in the pouring rain until a staff member found our booking and told us where to check in. You cannot enter your apartment until 4pm so that is a waste of 1 day. We got to our standard apartment in Egret Avenue to discover cigarette ends and broken glass outside the door. Entering the property there was a distinct smell of cannabis. It got worst the more I looked around the apartment. The table was broken, there was thick dust everywhere, the kitchen sides hadn’t been cleaned, there was chunks missing out the floor and table, the bathroom had blood marks on the walls and hair/dust everywhere. The toilet was broken and the whole apartment needed renovating. There was no way I was staying in that apartment regardless of price. I complained to the lady in the Oyster Bay Reception and showed her the pictures of the apartment. She rang someone who said I can be moved to a different apartment. Luckily enough we were moved right next door to my sister and her family. We decided to check out what the resort had on offer... except everything was shut except the arcades and a few restaurants. I assumed it was because it was late in the evening. The next morning my fiancé was making us a cup of tea when the kettle blew up and threw boiling water all over the kitchen narrowly missing my son. This had also tripped the electrics meaning we had no electricity. My partner went to guest services and explained what had happened. He was told it was a priority and would be sorted within 2 hours and someone would come and clean up the water. We stayed in the apartment for 3 hours waiting, but no one turned up. We had to go out as my son was throwing an absolute fit at being stuck indoors. I assumed someone may come and sort it whilst we were out. Unfortunately not. We got home to no electricity and a wet floor still. My fiancé decided to sort the electrics himself and we cleaned up the floor. My fiancé is Type 1 diabetic and needs the fridge to keep his insulin cold. Luckily the fridge remained at a cool level. We never heard anything back from guest services or maintenance during our short stay. We then decided to take advantage of the new swimming pool. Unfortunately the main pool and wave pool was much too cold for my son. He ended up with blue lips so we had to leave there. The children's pools were warm, but much too crowded to actually do anything. We then decided to do some rides, only to find it all shut down. We had no idea that pretty much everything on the resort shuts at 5pm. In summer. Including the pool. This is ridiculous. We decided to go and try The Diner for dinner... which was shut. Then we thought we will try Scoop the ice cream parlour, this was also shut. By this point I had already had enough. What the hell did I pay £400+ for? They charge you for EVERYTHING regardless if you have a pass. Want to ride a go cart? That’s £6 per go! Want to ride a dune buggy? That’s £2 for 1 go. Want to ride the new VR machines? That’s £5 per person. Want to play mini golf? Thats more money. Want to rent a family bike? Thats £9 for 30 minutes. We couldn’t use the outside parks because they were under maintenance. We couldn’t use the soft play throughout our stay as 1 it was just too busy and 2 the toddler section was overrun by bigger kids bullying little ones. So our days consisted of walking around or spending more money on the arcades. I was extremely disappointed. On Wednesday evening after another nightmare of a day (being turned away from the pool because it was for hotel users only in the morning, to finding restaurants shut again and eating the same thing for the third time) we decided enough was enough and we left Thursday a day earlier than planned. There was no one in guest services or reception to check out or to complain to, so we dropped our keys in a box and left. I have never EVER been so appalled by a resort for families in my life. I will never go back. I’ve complained via email and asked for a full refund.

The castle itself was very interesting - the walk up to the keep is quite hard going, but there are signs advising this. The views from it though are amazing so worth the climb.
The castle rooms are fascinating and lots to see there. We gift aided the ticket so got given a money off voucher that we used in the coffee shop. The coffee shop was nice, although - like similar attractions - quite pricey. The money off vouchers are a great idea though - more places should offer these for gift aiding the ticket price. The gift shop was great for those with younger children, but not really anything for older ones.
The castle is definitely worth a visit.

We’ve been going here for many years but were very disappointed by today’s meal. In general terms service was slow, plates were cold, and food wasn’t that great (potatoes on roast lunch had a pre-cooked feel rather than fresh). However our main issue was for the 2 of us who had liver and bacon, which was threaded with tubes; this made a large amount of it inedible. Our feedback secured us a 10% reduction off the cost of these dishes, which seemed to us a very inappropriate response. Having waited over 15 minutes for the bill whilst they debated our feedback, we couldn’t be bothered to take it any further. So having been a regular customer for many years, we won’t be going back unless we hear of a fairly miraculous turn around!

It’s all looking run down, not enough space inside during peak times and when raining. Can’t watch shows comfortably- kids standing on walls trying to see what’s going on.
The new swimming pool just feels like loads of paddling pools for kids but nothing for the adults. Can’t even go down the big slides with the your kids. Extremely busy and floors filthy.
My 4 year old couldn’t go on half the stuff in the fair ground as she wasn’t tall enough, but can go on rollercoasters at our local theme park. Such a let down for my daughter.
Toddler soft play a joke! Toddlers can’t do anything without and adult helping as the levels are too high.
We used to love coming to Butlin’s but it’s just too busy now.
My advise Butlin’s - Stop trying to cram all these people in! And bring the old pool back!

I’m going to stick to caravan parks - much more relaxed.

My husband and I stopped in for a hot drink and cake today for the first time with our baby who is 5 months. It was a struggle getting up the step and in which should have been our first clue! My husband held our baby on the table whilst we waited for drinks when we where told the baby couldn’t be near the table due to health and safety reasons. I had to nurse our daughter whilst we where there, completed covered under a muslin, and we received disgusted looks from the wait staff during feeding her and after. I couldn’t understand why as our baby was being so well behaved (for a change!) and just watching the world go by. The cake was nice but my hot chocolate tasted like one from a vending machine at quadruple the price. I just wanted to warn anyone thinking of visiting with a family probably best to go to one of the other many cafes in Arundel.

PROS OF BUTLINS
- good fairground
- decent food

CONS OF BUTLINS
- the pool (ABSOLUTELY disgusting, hair and plasters all over the floor and had only been open a couple of weeks )
- paper thin walls in the accommodation, noisy neighbours meant lots of disrupted sleep
- apartments are very basic, stayed in the ""new style silver"" yet it had a very musty smell to it
- far too busy
- supposed smoking places yet people are smoking and vaping everywhere including accommodation
- questionable people staying
- horrible nylon bedsheets

the list could go on!

474,Fino,Food,Bognor, Restaurant,6,Too much Truffle Oil,"It was our wedding aniversary on the 15th of June so i thought we'd try the Fino. My eldest son joined us as he was visiting from London. The starters were ok. My sons Penne pasta dish was bland which is not what you expect from Arribaita. We (my wife and I) ordered the Fillet steak rare. It wasn't but rather than complain on what was suppose to a celibration of 28 years of marriage, we perceivered. The steak was dry and over powered by the truffle oil which totally ruined it. After about 3/4 of the steak I gave up as did my wife. The so called Grosse Fries looked like they'd come from a Macains frozen bag and were anything but Grosse. When the proprieter asked how it was I replied ""do you want the truth2 and she said yes. I was somewhat supprised we she said there wasn't truffle oil on the dish! My taste buds and the other staff said differently. We were given a Lemoncello as a concellation, didn't enjoy that much either. We should've complained much sooner but as I said this was our aniversary and quite frankly if you can't cook a fillet steak you shouldn't be working in a kitchen especially one that costs £27.50.

476,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,191,My first time in Bognor Regis. Enjoyed every moment and got to meet Stephen Mulhern,"I’ve been going to Butlins in a regular basis for 10 years but I normally use the Minehead one as that one is closer to home. This year I’d tried Skegness for the first time and enjoyed that back in May so I thought I’d try this one in Bognor Regis. I got to say the camp is really good and like Skegness it is quite small. I had one issue with checking in though as they didn’t have the welcome package ready for me so I thought I’d give them a benefit of a doubt on that one. Eventually had my welcome package so went to my room. It’s a silver accommodation and unlike the Minehead and the Skegness ones, these ones were just apartments rather than chalets. It was a nice room but the only issue with it was the door not shutting properly and having to force it to shut. I suspect it needs planing down with too much paint or something but other than that it was in a really good spot. The entertainment was top class as always, the food facilities were great and this one includes a Papa Johns pizza which isn’t present in the other two Butlins camps. I also enjoyed the ocean spa and paid £22 for the 2 hour session and it was worth it, felt really relaxed. The highlight of my holiday was of course meeting Stephen Mulhern at the end of his show. This was the second time I met him after previously meeting him in London back in 2012 after a Catchphrase recording. He was lovely to me and the other people too. Even reminded him that I’d previously saw him and it made him smile. Shook my hand, gave me a high five and complimented my T Shirt. A truly unforgettable experience coming here. The camp itself was easy to find my way around, music being played everywhere reminds me of being in Alton Towers or Euro Disney. Will definitely be back here again at some point next year. Already got Butlins booked for New Years Eve but will be in the usual Minehead one for that. 8/10 overall for this break 👍🏻.

It was an impressive plate of food with good portions, and looked great till i tucked in. The veg was undercooked and cold, the nut roast was pale and very bland tasting, and nothing like a nut roast i have ever had before. I asked for some more gravy, and what turned up was the worst gravy i have ever tasted. It was the right colour. but had no taste at all, and was just awful. I tried to eat some of it, but gave up, as it was so cold and tasteless. Other people at the table also said the food was very bland and cold.

I rarely complain about food, but on this occasion, I returned the food, and was given a full refund. It has put me off returning there again.

488,Empress Bar,Food,Littlehampton, Pub/Bar,2,Patronising and poor customer service,"My girlfriend and I visited for a drink on our anniversary. Asked for a gin and lemonade and a pint, the drink clearly had no lemonade in and soda was used. We paid £12 for the two drinks.

From the get go we both felt like the older woman behind the bar was very condescending towards us because of our age. Looking at us once we ordered our drinks, she lent over the bar, expecting our IDs rather than asking. Must admit I felt very embarrassed at this point. We took our drinks and sat outside.

After a few sips of her drink, we realised the gin clearly had no lemonade and was completely flat. It tasted of watered down gin. I went and politely told the lady about it and she was very blunt blaming it on the fact we had “waited too long” and the ice would have made it taste like that. Being our anniversary the thought of leaving it and just going to our booked restaurant early instead seemed like a much better option. My girlfriend had to leave the majority of the drink, which clearly meant we weren’t trying to get a free one of what the lady probably assumed.

So from a perspective of working in hospitality too, the fact that there was no option for either a replacement or even offering to fill the glass up with lemonade or even an apology, I thought was appalling. Especially when paying more premium prices for the drinks.

No establishment should be patronising towards anyone or make anyone feel unwelcome. Being clearly the youngest customers should not have any difference on how we are treated. Hence my review.

501,Bognor Museum,Attractions,Bognor,Historical/Culture,58,Alice's Vegetable pies deter Hitler,"A splendid, little, quirky museum with lots of things of interest to me. The first thing I noticed was an 1897 playbill (for “Madcap Madge”, which I somehow must have missed when it came to Bath). I have never noticed this before but the list of characters included lines spoken by them - very useful for those theatregoers such as myself, who have a tendency to doze through performances - so we had one character who said “Blessed is he who expects nothing”, but another had the depressing line, “Time, please.” (hopefully not the heroine)
Then on to “Alice’s (wartime) Kitchen” where you can listen to her talk about her delicious vegetable pies and dried egg concoctions. I was intrigued to know that the BBC Home Service regularly broadcast an 8.15-8.20 wartime slot called “The Kitchen Front” giving advice to housewives just before they went out for the “morning shop”. (None of the weekly supermarket shop nonsense in those days!) However, Alice must have been telling little fibs - or perhaps her memory is not so good these days - when she spoke of later listening to “Life With the Lyons” on the wireless, as this didn’t start until 1950.
A photograph reminded me that my favourite comedian, Tony Hancock, had filmed “The Punch and Judy Man” in Bognor Regis. As a devoted fan, I have previously stayed in his parents’ old hotel in Bournemouth.
I also enjoyed the room full of old wirelesses, memories of being a kid, bouncing a ball around the living room and breaking the screen on my parents’ old “Philco” came flooding back, although the collection at the museum in Droitwich - those were the days for wireless transmission! - is probably more extensive.
A sign told me that beer was “watered down” during World War 1 - not sure whether this was landlords making their supplies stretch a bit, or it was by government decree - but the thought that “being drunk was seen as being unpatriotic” seems a bit harsh after spending all that cash on weak beer. (Personally, I’m still following the directive about “no-one being allowed to buy a round a drinks.”)
Altogether, very enjoyable and lots of fun!

Went to guest services, closed. Phoned them the next day, then told to phone photo booth, several calls later was told I couldn't have them due to GDPR. Contacted customer service ... not interested in my issue, nor my time being wasted like this, and when I said that they should tell customers that if their photos were taken after 4pm, that they had to be in the resort in person the next day to collect them (ie not to waste our time as customers in a fruitless excercise), customer service respond, and I quote 'your comments regarding this being communicated to guests will be kept in mind for future discussions'. That they will only 'keep' this 'in mind' for 'future discussions' makes me think someone needs firing in their customer service department, and as for my wasted time just an empty word 'sorry', not even ""oh hey look you wasted part of your day and an hour or so trying to get your photos by contacting guest services, etc, as the girl advised you to do, here's a 5 pence voucher to buy a sweetie"".

515,Premier Inn Littlehampton,Accommodation,Littlehampton,Hotel,26,Worst Premier Inn I have ever stayed at,"Absolutely AWFUL. Check In was fine, but I got put in a room in the ""New"" block which meant a walk outside a 0 degrees celcius :-( When I got to the ""New"" block, the front door was swinging in the wind, which meant the enterance and corridors were also very cold. My room was cold (until I found the Aircon control). Having set the aircon to 21 Celcius I'm then confronted with a system that's noisy (sounds like a jet plane cruising). Then when I went for a meal at the attached pub/restaurant that was dire (I left Hungry) and because of this experience I cancelled my Breakfast at reception. Finally (and to me the last straw - hence this poor review) when I went to order pizza from a.n.other I needed a postcode, only the Post Code on the website was advertised as BN16 1AF, when infact it's actually BN16 1EB. Complete disgrace. WORST Premier Inn I have ever stayed in (and believe me I've done quite a few). Recommend - certainly NOT.

They added a service charge to our table of 4 which I think is out of order.

Unless your under 5'6 you better hope for a ground floor. Much preferred the old pool. New one is more for toddlers I feel and my 8 year old got bored very quickly.

Food- actually pretty good and enough choice for kids and adults.

Entertainment - butlins have definitely cut back on the cost for external bands outside of seasons or special weeks. Team work hard on stage but ABBA show is poor from a show prospective and I’ve seen loads more invested in previous productions.

538,"The Windmill, Harvester",Food,Littlehampton, Pub/Bar,27,Take away very disappointing ,"Since we were unable to go out for a meal my sons decided to treat me to a Harvester take away for Father’s Day.

One of them placed the order online via the Harvester website at 7pm for collection at 9pm. One of my sons wanted the “Cowboy” burger but didn’t want bacon on it as he doesn’t eat pork, although you can “customise” your order there is no way to exclude an item, only change the sides. When confirming the order the site suggests phoning the restaurant if you want any changes. The site also advises that the details have been emailed.

After about 15 minutes I phoned the restaurant and said I wanted to modify an online takeaway order. The person who answered said he couldn’t find it on their system and since no email confirmation had been received yet I should call back when that had been received.

I rang back shortly after 8pm as I was concerned that we’d still not had email confirmation and since the phone wasn’t answered I left a voice message asking them to ring me.

Come time the order was due to be collected I was greeted well and the server went to bag up the order which only took a couple of minutes. I took the order home and my wife was dismayed to find that although she had ordered 2 jacket potatoes with her “Simply Chicken” these were not to be found but it appeared she had a portion of chips instead. She had also not received any gravy. Her vegetables were cold, not room temperature, actually cold.

We felt the portions were small considering the prices seemed pretty high.

We had ordered 4 desserts which were not to be found so I returned to the restaurant. The server (no name badge that I could see) was extremely apologetic and went to get the desserts.

The chef brought the desserts out and explained they need to be heated at home since if they were to heat them the plastic containers would melt. This should be made clear on the menu when ordering.

All the staff looked tired after what had probably been a long busy day but were still polite, helpful and friendly. That was the only redeeming feature as we felt the food was poor value and quality as was the accuracy of the order.

Over 4 hours later we still haven’t received a confirmation email or return phone call.

first off some of the staff were amazing and I hope this review dosen't put the place in much of a bad light, but at the same time let me explain why it was not a good holiday for us.
First of all the ""schedule"" compared to CP yes there are activities which are scheduled... BUT dose the pool have to be so ridged in its times during a tots week? CP are open all day every day with food and drink available... with a swimming mad son... and this being his only really love at the place it gave us little to do the rest of time...
You might be think ahh there are shows.. rides, slot machines, activities, stuff to do around the park... well... Not for us..
Son didn't like the rides, didn't like the shows and the slot machines (which I really wasn't happy with... introduce your child to gambling... emmmmmm...) 30 mins at the most of entertainment. The winter break and constant rain meant we were stuck inside the resort and thus we exhausted the craft activity was left craving to go home. The one show we did take him too ended up scaring him...
He could not go on the big soft play because of the height restriction
The bed was dirty on arrival (They changed it right away)
The pool changing area could have offered overshoes.
We ended up coming home early and little one was sick and then my husband and I came down with it 2 days later...
Having been to CP both UK and Belgium they seem to offer less yet we get so much more out of the holiday. Maybe its because we really don't like that type of entertainment. I have left feedback with them... we had a reply, which they didnt address my issue over the gambling aspect of the site. wont be going there again.

It’s such a shame as the Castle Restaurant is such an elegant space, all the staff have been very professional and friendly and the food is AMAZING! There are a plethora of restaurants in Arundel which are not to the standard of the Norfolk’s Castle Restaurant so it really confuses me why these other restaurants seem to be full to the brim on a weekend night and the Norfolk always sadly seems so quiet. Local residents of Arundel you are missing a trick! Although we really like that we can decide to go for a meal on the spur of the moment and know that the Norfolk Castle Restaurant will be able to accommodate us, it really does seem a shame that it isn’t busier given the food is exceptional and in my opinion, one of the best restaurants in Arundel!

554,The Norfolk Tap,Food,Arundel, Pub/Bar,6,Aggressive reception from the guy that ran it,"So last week my partner and I walked into the pub, it seemed to have a nice vibe and we were going to sit outside with a nice cold alcohol free beer.

The young guy behind the bar was very sweet - he's the reason I am giving The Norfolk Tap 2 stars rather than 1. The young guy asked how we were and what we would like. I asked what alcohol free beers they have - they didn't have any, but he said he could pop across and get a couple of Becks Blue for us from the hotel - we were more than happy and grateful that he would do that.

Then someone said very loudly in an aggressive tone ""why would you do that"", I didn't realise he was talking to us at first, then he said it again but louder. I assumed it was just a local at the pub, drunk having a joke. But I looked at him and he said very seriously ""Why would you come in here and order an alcoholic free beer, WHY?!"" I explained because that's what we wanted.

He then proceeded to go on about how he ran the place and didn't understand why people came in and ordered alcohol free beers. He was hostile and aggressive. Not a very nice way to greet new customers at all. He could see I was quite shocked and taken aback by what he was saying so started to backtrack. He kept saying we should try the 3.6% beer as it is low alcohol, I tried to explain to him that we aren't drinking. He couldn't seem to comprehend it at all. He said there are no good alcohol free beers so he wouldn't stock them. Which my partner and I both said there were lots of lovely alcoholic free beers out there. He said ""Well no local breweries that sell them"", I corrected him and told him there were. It's something my partner and I have looked into a lot. One brewery I gave him was the Laine brewery in Brighton - King Limbo is a lovely beer, it's extremely popular in Brighton and Hove, we've actually been told by a few bars and pubs in Brighton they can't believe how much they're selling of it. He clearly didn't know what he was talking about, which is fine, we don't expect people to know everything about non alcoholic beers, as it's a fairly new trend that seems to be picking up. What wasn't ok, was the way he spoke to us and treated us.

We promptly got our Becks Blues (which were smaller bottles than the normal and more expensive than normal as well), sat outside and drank them quickly and left. We were shocked and upset by how the guys spoke to us and certainly won't be going back there.

The spag Bol was tasteless (how can any chef get this basic dish so badly wrong) mash pots were lumpy and cold. Waitress didn’t even listen to what was asked to leave off a dish. Veal escalope on the specials board was dry and like rubber. The lamb shank was tough and didn’t fall off bone like it should. I could go on but can’t be bothered. Just like their chef and waiting staff. Only saving grace was the desserts which were actually edible. Will not return,1,4.0,2.0,British,1

I don't know if the chefs have changed or if it simply depends who is working that night, but the quality of the food varies from visit to visit. Sometimes a dish like harissa and courgettes and halloumi will be tangy and spicy with a lot of sauce, other times it will have no spice or sauce at all. The wine is expensive - it seems extraordinary to charge £25.50 for a cheap bottle of prosecco - especially when at the other end of the street they charge £9.99 for a very similar bottle.

571,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,3,Filthy and Worn Out,"We booked a suite for two nights (having looked at the beautiful photos on the website) and had invited family to have afternoon tea the following afternoon and again for lunch on the Sunday. The hotel looked very impressive as we drove up. Check in was fine - they acknowledged my Hilton Honors membership and gave us some sweets for our son. As soon as we started to go to our room you could see that the carpets were filthy. The stair surrounds were disgusting and looked like they all needed a good scrub with soap and water and the handrails were really sticky. The carpet and upstairs was no better. Stains everywhere and had ripples in it where it had stretched. It literally looked like it hadn’t been vacuumed for a month. The walls were marked and scuffed and the doors looked grubby. The suite was a joke. The carpet was sticky and the room smelt dreadful! A room with a pull out sofa bed that was made up so nowhere to sit, and the facing wall had a massive damp patch and peeling paint. The bedroom was no better, smelt of damp and didn’t look like it had even been hoovered and the bathroom had an old shower over the bath. Hardly the modern facilities shown on the website. We asked for another suite and were told none available until the next evening. The duty manager offered us a family room which was in the same tatty and run down state and was so small you’d be unable to pass someone by the side of the bed. We were then told that there was a new extension - unfortunately full - which presumably is where the photos were taken. We decided we would leave and stated that it was because the place was filthy and the manager said it was because it is in the process of being renovated. Sorry, but that doesn’t give you carte Blanche to offer minging accommodation. Naturally, given the cleaning of the rooms and public areas, we didn’t want to risk the food so cancelled our bookings. Ruined a family weekend that had been planned as a surprise for relatives not seen for five years. Really disappointed in Hilton on this one.

Ambience Dinner, and lunch

The same table we had both times felt sticky and so unpleasant to the touch, the table location at the end of the restaurant was very noisy on both occasions but especially at the dinner serving

The service

at the dinner this was just about ok, the waitress was busy so we could understand some errors that she made to the orders, our group thought she was being over familiar and overtly friendly

The lunchtime service was better although one waitress obviously thought we were all deaf by the volume of her speaking to the group

The food,

honestly some dishes were good, others dry and tastless,
the special recommended dishes really should be avoided as they are cooked to death, over hot ( microwave possibly??) and dry

Other food was ok, but even that was not up to even 3*** standard, so the bill of between £25~£35 average per person was way over what we should have paid for food of that standard

596,Establo Lounge,Food,Littlehampton, Pub/Bar,4,Weird ,"Weird experience, not quite sure what the market is for them - advertise tapas which is Spanish for food and talk...the food wasn’t remotely Spanish - too much oil (it’s not portugal).

The food is so varied - burgers and other mains you may as well go elsewhere because it’s better value for money for the quality.

Staff weren’t the passionate exciting staff I’m used to in other “tapas” USP bars. They looked bored.

The catchment market and the people that go there don’t match the atmosphere, the housy style music for the “entitled” youngsters that feel they’re important in there doesn’t equate the the clientele that sit there in the day paying for over priced coffee like costa.

Considering I’m never in the UK but this place is an example of why I hate being here so much and rather travel to authentic real places - won’t be returning any time soon, weird atmosphere, weird concept and the clientele ruin the place.

A real Spanish tapas and wine bar would be a great catch in Rustington - the clientele is there for it - just seems like the leakage from the lamb down the other end has come here for a “exquisite” setting

Good points however,
Layout, open spread out and comfortable
Great seating, felt cosy and warm
Cocktails excellent

597,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,3,Very disappointing in all areas,"Took our granddaughter for a term time break at Bognor Butlins as we had done last year but this time it was quite awful and what a rip off! All the activities that 9 year olds enjoy came at an additional cost usually £8 each and that is just one turn on the zip wire which was over within seconds. The archery is over booked so you don’t get your own target but have to share so spend half the time standing around. However worse than that the evening entertainment is up stairs which is serviced by only one lift! Two out of the four nights we were there the lift was out of order meaning the person in our party with mobility difficulties could not attend, that is 50% of the promised entertainment not assessable. The same happened last year and we put it down to bad luck but two years running is just not acceptable.
The food is okay for mass production but the dining room tables are really squashed in making accessibility for wheelchairs very difficult and even doing that there are not enough at peak times and people often had to wait.
The new swimming pool disabled changing rooms were really dirty on all of the four days we used them. We used three different ones and each had terrible drainage problems. My granddaughter and I actually got locked in one of them when the handle stopped working inside. We were eventually let out by another guest after repeatedly banging on the door and shouting. We immediately informed the person on reception, who didn’t offer any apology but said they would deal with it. We watched and waited she didn’t move and we were concerned that no one else should have the experience that my husband found a lifeguard and explained again and he then locked the door. Once in the pool area there were no easy access steps or hoist to get in or out of the main pool from the wheel chair. My granddaughter throughly enjoyed the different pool areas and they were successful.
The fun fair is diminishing too with two adult rides missing from last year only one of which has been replaced but with a children’s ride.
Definitely not the Butlins we’ve known before and loved but a Hugh expensive disappointing experience that we will not be repeating.

The food eventually came after waiting 2 hours. This is an extremely long time considering we live within one mile of the takeaway. When it came I had wished it didn’t – it was completely cold and soggy. The crispy Chinese food we enjoy was cold and mushy. The food comes in tinfoil lined bags so it had sweated and gone cold. We microwaved the noodles but as the rest of the food looked a mess so we had to throw it in the bin.
I called the takeaway the following day, not really to complain but to let them know of the poor service I received. The guy told me he will tell the manager and he would get back to me whilst I would likely get 15% off my next order. I never heard back or got an apology from them, hence me writing this review. I wouldn’t go back even with 15% off. I paid £20 for a load of rubbish and the customer service was that of business that simply doesn’t care.

Me and a few friends had a fantastic weekend. The fancy dress cant fault it we all wore pink the pink ladies for a hen do lol. I am definatly coming again everything at our stay clean and tidy. The food in the deck wow so much choice I didnt know where to start. Staff friendly, although on the omlette station my omlettte had been burnt and I explained this to the person and got a rude reply and further telling me they were shutting down the station. Although a friendly team member overheard and approached me and apologised on the persons behalf the staff member from the counters told me the name of the person is steven. We did notice there had been 15 minutes of service left not impressed I ended up eating other food. I felt that a complaint would go no where but please ask staff to be polite we pay good money for most of it a good service. The Trip over all best I have been to I will be returning. I did notice how welcome you all made us feel. A shout out to resort safety they are down to earth and a brilliant laugh.

615,Bailiffs Court,Accommodation,Littlehampton,Hotel,60,Such a lovely stay ,"We stayed for one night with dinner and breakfast included. We arrived much earlier than the check in time and were made to feel so welcome right from the start. We were told we were welcome to use the facilities and go and enjoy the spa and received a soft check in email later on to inform us when our room was ready. We obviously didn’t have our robes from our room at that point and apparently the robes at the spa are only for people having treatments but the spa staff arranged for ours to be sent over. We were given flip flops on request. The spa was very clean and although there aren’t probably enough sun loungers at all times they are very good at regularly checking to ensure people haven’t just left towels on beds and gone away. The weather was unusually warm and sunny so it would have been nice for some loungers to be put outside for the people who hadn’t got loungers inside but there were tables and chairs. We enjoyed the outdoor pool and jacuzzi which was heated and were so lucky that the weather was so beautiful during our stay. Changing rooms were fine with 2 hairdryers ( but no straightners and nowhere to plug your own in) The complimentary tea and coffee was a lovely touch.
Our room was much nicer than anticipated with fabulous views. Gorgeous complimentary homemade cookies!
We received an invitation to 2 complimentary bellinis before dinner which was also another lovely touch.
Pre dinner drinks and canapés were excellent - as was the service. The restaurant was so pretty and nicely full and service was again excellent. The food was really good too.
The following morning we awoke to our complimentary newspaper and also enjoyed a delicious breakfast with lots of choice. Poached eggs cooked to perfection! Again, very friendly service.
After checking out we were welcome to use the spa again for as long as we like liked and we then enjoyed a stroll around the grounds and down to the beach.
We finished with coffee and more delicious cookies sitting in the sun before we sadly had to leave.
Overall, the most lovely stay in a beautiful hotel. Every single member of staff were so friendly and made us feel so welcome. Thank you Bailiffscourt and we cannot wait to return!

616,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,0,Halloween season has just started,"This was our first time there after being told a lot about it from different friends with kids.
We absolutely loved it, obviously accommodation could do with some maintenance but for a few days was ok.
There's a lot to do there for smaller kids so was ideal for us. We stayed at Oyster bay which was a good location to everything. Kids loved the pool, really amazing for small kids and water is warm for babies also.
Fairground was ok, decoration was already Halloween one and my daughter loved the graveyard...especially with the entertainers.
Theatre was really good and some other shows for kids. Arcade was ok to spend money and time. We haven't got to all during a weekend, so plenty to do. The very best part probably the Halloween fairground night was! So thank you for the resort and its lovely staff for this amazing time! See you soon for sure! Xx

617,The Mezze,Food,Bognor, Restaurant,26,must just be unlucky......,"The general reviews for this place are good but have now been 3 times and wont return again.

618,Black Rabbit,Food,Arundel, Pub/Bar,342,Mostly indifferent (or poor) food...no comprehension of customer service!!!,"
We, a group of five friends, meet every four/six weeks for a meal, sometimes trying somewhere different for a change. I’m not sure who suggested the Black Rabbit.......

None of the food was particularly good and some was dreadful. The whitebait was flabby, steak pie was good (although with a mass produced look), a burger was tough and looked/felt like it had been made ages before and reheated. A steak was tough. None of us risked a pudding.

Whatever we thought of the food we all agreed the service was terrible. Our main course was served about thirty five/ forty minutes after finishing the starters, an hour and ten minutes after we all sat down.

My wife specifically asked if she could have a “small 125 measure of Sauvignon wine”. She was told she could have the smaller measure, although a 175ml measure was supplied and when queried the waiter said “not to worry as only 125ml would be charged for”. Needless to say 175ml appeared on the bill! (My wife left a considerable amount of wine in the glass - the issue was not the money, it was she just doesn’t want that much wine, and for some drivers the larger measure could put them above the ‘drink/drive’ limit). Despite the law saying 125ml has to be supplied if requested it is often difficult to obtain. (On this occasion given the lengths gone to specify 125ml I spoke to the local Licensing Authority. They confirmed the smaller measure was legally required to be displayed and supplied if requested. They will add The Black Rabbit to their inspection list. I can only hope they take enforcement action sometime).

As for getting the bill and then trying to pay it......when we eventually got it, we asked for the bill to be split between two couples and one single and to include circa 10% service (why we included service I don’t know!). Oh no!, “the system” couldn’t cope with this meaning the manager had to be found (more delay!). After being told how difficult it was to alter the bill I said I intended to leave my name and address and the bill could be posted on, it was agreed a new bill would be prepared!!!

My advice to anyone thinking of visiting - go elsewhere, there are far better run pubs not far away.

Some way into the meal my wife discovered a burned area inside the pasta dish too.
Very unpleasant.

My meal was a Pizza Carbonara, which had large lump of black carbon on the plate with it, and the egg in the centre was hard. All around the edges, the base was so hard baked that I could shatter it in many places with a tap of my knife. I requested a replacement soft egg which was provided without fuss.
Neither of us was able or willing to finish the meal.

Although we had a reduction for this, I did not feel very comfortable with the meal and although I am local, will be avoiding the place again.

627,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,6,BEST time at Butlins 80s weekend!,"Butlins 80s weekend was one of the best weekends I have ever had! From the moment we pulled up to the resort, a party atmosphere had been created by the enthusiastic and helpful staff. The lady that checked us in was also brilliant! So chatty and cheerful and provided us with lots of great advice on how we should approach and enjoy the weekend ahead.
We were lucky because we had booked silver apartments but were told we had been given ones that had just been renovated and they did not disappoint! We were surprised by the amount of space we had and the cleanliness was of a good standard. The only criticism I would give is that the showers are very small and not very powerful.
There were 14 of us altogether and we were in 3 separate apartments meeting up regularly in the apartment that sleeps 7 people with plenty of room for us all. We headed out on the Friday to the sky pavilion first before hitting the centre stage night club. Great music, great people and a fantastic atmosphere resulting in us not getting to bed until 3am and feeling a little fragile in the morning.
I was lucky enough to escape the hangover so a small group of us headed to the pool party at the splash waterworld on the Saturday morning. This was one of the highlights of my weekend. Again, such a good atmosphere with every one having fun and enjoying the great 80s tunes.
If you’re a fan of activities then Butlins had a lot to offer during the day such as go karts and arcades. We chose to go bowling which was great and at £7, good value for money.
I will say there was not a lot of variety when it came to food but I did enjoy the fish and chips and it wasn’t too expensive. They delivered to our apartment for free and it was a very quick service.
Saturday night was also brilliant where we saw Go West and Pat Sharp before ending up in the silent disco.
Overall we had a fantastic weekend and have already booked to come back in May!Just a little tip....it’s quite a walk from the car park to oyster bay apartments so I suggest just bringing one big suitcase to avoid getting a bad back with lugging heavy bags!!!

630,Norfolk Arms,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,13,Great Potential,"Some positives - a comfortable bed and a very good location.

Employees were seated on the ground, smoking in the car park and dirty laundry was left in a pile by the exit for quite some time.

The back of my bathroom door was heavily spattered with someone else's toothpaste or soap remains, which was an unpleasant surprise although the high quality bath gel and shampoo were welcome. The bathmat had a large hole in it although all linen was clean.

This wonderful, old building could, with a little TLC, a good, deep clean and some attention to interior design, be a really nice boutique-type hotel. Instead it's tired, shoddy and seems unloved. A real pity. Such potential!

666,WWT Wetland,Attractions,Arundel,Nature/Gardens,50,Disappointing half term activity,"We visited in the February half term lured in by the ‘puddle jumping championship’ which sounded ideal for my young children who are obsessed with muddly puddles. What we found was a large, unorganised queue of families and a plastic tray with an inch of water in it. After waiting 15 minutes the children were allowed 1 jump in the plastic tray then scored out of 100 and given a sticker. The staff were trying to make it a bit more exciting but this wasn’t really possible given the circumstances. We had high hopes of a puddle assault course where children could play and splash freely rather than regimented queuing for 1 jump. Not worth wrestling them into the puddlesuit for. There was, however, a much larger natural puddle just round the corner which they enjoyed far more. This ‘event’ needs a rethink.
The boat trip however was excellent and a lovely way to end an otherwise disappointing day for the children.

The exterior and interior is in need of a lick of paint. The bedroom and bathroom was clean and comfortable but basic and in need of new fittings. The hotel is OK but it lacks charm, the greater part being because it’s interior needs a complete makeover.

it’s not been open long and it’s a mess. parts of it are falling off and the place is so dirty it made me feel like i needed a tetanus shot! the changing area was so disgusting and dirty with hair and rubbish everywhere. not once did i see anyone cleaning. as many have said it’s most definitely not centreparcs!
then to add to it you can’t even accompany your children down the main slides as they are restricted to under 18?? only! i’m not sure why??? so there was very little for me to do but walk around looking at the state of the place which is supposed to be state of the art but is in fact filthy and breaking already!
then we move onto the fairground rides. half of these were broken down so basically we moved between three!
i’m sorry butlins you have really lost your edge! in tough times you will not get the customers if you don’t buck up your ideas. the state of the pool says it all. if you can’t get that right what hope do you have!
can’t see us returning, i’m paying the extra and going back to centre parcs

Thank you to Clare the blond lady at the shoreline, fantastic service from her.
Not relaxing with kids flying about everywhere but that’s not why we are here! Alll in all a good visit so far!
Negative was our stay ruined by all the people smoking everywhere and dropping fag butts everywhere!

Whoever answered was curt and most unwelcoming.
No change when we arrived at 7pm on a quiet Sunday evening- customers and welcome sparse.
So we ordered- the waiter was the same man who had answered my call earlier and was surly and unhelpful.
The rose wine we ordered was unavailable and a bottle of Barefoot was offered as an alternative- which is available at 2 for £10 at a local convenience store. He agreed to let us have it at the price of our chosen wine - £15.95.
Food ordered- fairly uncomplicated other than my partner not wanting Lamb tikka on his mixed grill.
Poppadoms and dips were fine - predictably he tried to take them away when we were done so we had to ask for them to be left for our main.
Mixed grill arrived and looked good, apart from the pile of unasked for Lamb tikka - this was replaced with chicken when mentioned.

Parking a problem - both car parks in front and behind the restaurant were full at 6.50 p.m. so, had no choice but to park on the road - imagine the neighbours are probably fed up with this. Evening started off well enough although, as some other reviewers have noted - what, exactly has been refurbished! My sister commented that the carpet looks the same as when it was the Smugglers Roost (30+ years ago!). Lots of people in the bar area with the football on, restaurant busy and we were early - 7 p.m. The restaurant is large and we were seated in the area where the restaurant bar is and where takeaways are collected from. From the very beginning, the noise levels are significant, making it almost impossible to have a normal conversation, the phone constantly ringing for takeaway orders and people in and out to collect. We opted for the 'All you can eat' buffet which is good value for money as, other than the 2 Lobster dishes, you can chose anything you want. However, whilst the food is plentiful, I can't say it had much flavour to it. The evening started to deteriorate when the staff started to bring out wrong dish after wrong dish to us and, when we politely pointed this out, the correct dishes took ages to arrive so we were all eating at different stages. The staff became grumpier as the evening went on with one young girl looking like she had been in floods of tears, one couldn't help herself but slam everything onto the table and a smile was certainly beyond her, another was the only one who seemed to know what was going on and was apologetic over the service. My sister used the ladies toilet at the end of the evening and said she felt as though her shoes were sticking to the flooring - yuk!

This place is noisy beyond tolerance. Bare white plastered walls, no tableclohs and music blaring in the restaurant from the bar. It is noisy with absolutely no ambience. It is impossible to have a conversation without shouting accross the tightly packed tables. I have had quieter meals in burger chains on kids birthdays.
Yes on arrival we were greeted at the door and ushered to our table whereupon we were asked if we wanted to order wine before we had sat down. very pushy.
Instantly had the feeling of being ""processed"" not welcomed.
A waitress brought menu's and again asked if we wanted to order wine before we had seen the drinks menu. We declined saying we would choose drinks to go with our meal.
She returned and asked again!
Eventually we ordered. First we got Bruscetta as one dish which was a whole pannini with vey little strips of pepper and beetroot with 1 tiny anchovy, I had 3 of the smallest sardines you have ever seen.
On complaint we were told that this was the chef's interpretaion of what a Bruscetta might be......not an actual bruscetta (and nothing like that shown on their web site)
For mains we had a sea trout fillet (average but not special) and I ordered the Chicken breast with pancetta and crushed new potatoes and""greens"". What I got was a minute chicken breast About 1/3 supermarket size with two very small new potatoes and some long strands of green vegitables that I can only deduce to be cabbage. I could not tell. There was no pancetta but there was a hard brown golf ball size lump of something that i assumed was the stuffing. it was inedble.
A waitress asked if the meal was ok but did not pause for a reply so I called her back. I complained about my meal and our accompanying garlic ciabatta that was again just pannini . She was happy to stand and argue with me her main defences being that 1. they had never had complaints before and 2. the ciabatta is what their supplier sends them ( does their chef not order his supplies? or is it a case of anything will do for the punters?)
They took my meal away and replaced it with what was described as ""veal Milanese. I could go on for hours but by now I had lost faith that they new anything about what they were serving up. There were breadcrumbs (not parmesan) over cooked and burnt around the edes covering some tough, tasteless, dark brown meat. I have never seen veal that colour before.
We ordered coffee and left.

I do not expect to be spoken to by one of your staff like that.....my holiday wasn’t free gratis and I don’t expect hostility because I smoke.....you need to up your game all round in my opinion

700,Black Horse,Food,Arundel, Pub/Bar,4,Staff So Rude!,"Having heard that the management had changed hands we were keen to give this restaurant another go. Having read recent reviews about the food and experience we were optimistic that we'd have a local restaurant to add to our regular places to go for a sunday lunch. Admittedly we hadn't booked, but our general experience with the local pubs is that you dont need to but you may need to wait for food which is totally fine with us.
We arrived at 1.15pm to find there were 2 tables with shade available in the garden. Brilliant! We went into the bar area to ask whether we could have a menu (there's only waitress service inside and not outside, which was fine) The young lady that was behind the bar had stated there would be a 30 minute wait for food which we had said was totally fine. We were happy to wait for food whilst we had drinks. If I'm honest the way she responded made us feel like we had put her nose out of joint that we'd even asked about food. She then repeated that there would be a 30 minute wait... to which I said that was fine. She seemed surprised it was ok. But in all honesty I was happy we had found somewhere that we could get a table at without booking. I asked my partner whether he picked up on the frostyness and he completely agreed. Anyway after shaking it off, we got our toddler settled into the high chair and chose our food. Only to find that when we then went back into the bar to order food and drinks that the young lady said we couldn't order until 30 minutes time! It is the most absurd thing I have ever heard in terms of a service!! I completely understand that you may need to wait after ordering.... but to have to wait to ORDER.... is baffling! She was so abrupt I was so taken back. The most frustrating part of this was that the manager was not interested in even facing us to speak to us. We were not worthy of her attention. In fact I'm not sure if anyone was. I am gutted because it has potential to be great. No matter how good food is, Service is key and there's no point having staff that dont have any customer service skills. I am disgusted at how we were spoken to.

The irony is that we headed up to the Village Inn, they were just as busy as the black horse. We got the last table in the garden, we ordered, the staff so friendly and our food was on the table all within 15 minutes.

Starters ? Opted for scallops. We expected, given the £ supplement, to receive 2 maybe 3 King Scallops. We were given what appeared to be 4 Queenie's, just the width of a10p piece max, BUT CUT IN HALF through their girth to a max thickness of 2 £1 coins stacked, presented as 8 pieces,seared side up ????

Mains? I opted for herb crusted cod fillet, again, mean-spirited portion. Tad wider than a fish finger, tasty yes but again tiny .The penultimate negative? Hubby ordered "" Cake "" A Fish Cake of sorts, on a ""Lobster Cream"" and a ""poached egg"" on top,which,as eggs go, had the unyielding stance of a cold squash ball and needed pinning before carving. Given the the slow service, it had been sitting on the pass for too long and is why the lobster cream dissipated.

Final negative? A bill for £100 excluding service with just one small glass of average wine.

Upon complaint..Charlie, a fine ambassador for the BCH simply advised us that our remarks would be forwarded to the chef. By then a tad too late, day already spoilt. Given BCH knew at the time of booking it that it was an important event, I am just so sorry they failed to live up to their own reputation.

Go into the place and i was the only person there other than an elderly gent, door open on a cold day, tried to shut door which was stuck open. Music playing in the back kitchen where the host (presume Vicky) was at doing nothing in particular. Eventually she came to the front, no hello, no smiley face just a miserable attitude. I ordered a bacon sandwich and a cup of tea. I asked politely for ketchup on the sandwich, then informed “it’s on the table”. I asked for strong tea without sugar, to be told abruptly “sugar on the table and the bag’s left in to sort myself”. It cost £3.50, I only had a £10 note and was rudely asked if I had smaller. I said no and offered a card, then got change and sat at the table. Then the other gent got up and ordered, same attitude and when he asked for crispy bacon was told “obviously that’s going to take longer”.
After a while and relative silence in the restaurant area and muffled music from the back, my sandwich was delivered (nearly thrown on the table). Dry old bread, under cooked bacon and cheap Margarine. Someone else came in during my stay to check if they were open as he’d tried on two previous days to get in and they were shut. He was given such attitude by this lady that I’d be surprised if he came back with his 5 friends, I wouldn’t have and certainly won’t be going back there again.

Cigarette butts were all over the floor which clearly weren't from Monday alone and the chairs and tables looked grubby. The decor inside just doesn't work - the pub doesn't know what it is.

The seating arrangement inside just doesn't work either and I couldn't have imagined eating here as a family - cant comment on the food, but it looked like it might be from a fryer.

For one of our drinks I ordered a G&T, as they have a good choice of gin, and was watching the gin being poured into the measure and was very surprised to see that it was a short measure and when the team member was challenged they denied it. Measures should be filled to the top, not half a centimetre below because they’re afraid to spill the spirit.
On ordering our food I asked for gluten free mozzarella sticks to be told that there were none. This isn’t the first time there has been menu items or drinks unavailable because of poor stock control.
When our meal was delivered one item had to be returned as it was cold and a gluten free burger had a gluten containing side on the same plate which had the risk of cross contamination.
For desert a gluten free was ordered and when it was subsequently brought to the table it had a wafer in it, so was sent back.
Whilst our food related problems were resolved there appears to be a wholesale lack of knowledge about allergens and this should be addressed as a matter of urgency.
Extremely poor customer service - The staff were not engaging with the vast majority of customers and seemed to have favourite customers and had no awareness of what was happening as there were tables left uncleared for 20 - 30 mins. Started to feel that we were an inconvenience to them.

Had chicken satay and dumplings to start. Chicken was ok but dumplings were the worst we’d ever had, hard and dry.
Starter plates were cleared and I still had food in my mouth eating. Was wondering what the rush was and then I realised, the other waitress was stood behind with our mains. Hated this as had no break in between starters and mains and again it was made apparent there was a rush.
I had ordered what was meant to be a very very mild curry. It still had chillies in and was too hot to eat. Maybe the reason for this was that the waitress wasn’t even making eye contact when taking our order and was in a rush?
One waitress asked why I hadn’t touched the curry and we explained it was too hot to eat more than a mouthful. Rather than helping she walked away?!!!
When our plates were cleared another waitress apologised and told us we wouldn’t be charged for it. Very kind and we did appreciate this. But she said to mention it earlier in the future and they could have changed my meal. (We had mentioned it earlier and this didn’t happen).
Bill came and there was an automatic 10% service charge on there. Something we would have refused to pay had they not taken the curry off in good gest.

Overall we were in and out in 1 hour, nearly £80 down. That is not what we expect when you save to go for a celebratory meal.

The pool is small, the facilities non existent, the relax room not really relaxing, just a sitting room with 4 loungers, only herbal tea - not “allowed” coffee or milk. As both spa members informed us and questioned guests as to what member actually bought the milk in when it not allowed - really should guest be hearing this?
No dressing gowns or slippers available, not for discount guests anyway.
Had a lovely massage and facial but the time 25 min each was slightly shorter, about 45 mins for both. Must be because we were discount again. Definitely made to feel they were doing us a favour.
However the staff in the bar and restaurant were lovely, very good service. Lovely 2 course meal, have to buy drinks as this is not included, but that was expected.
Won’t go again, not even with discount voucher would rather save up and pay more (real price) but to a different spa, there’s a lot of competition near.
The voucher might get people in but I doubt there’s much repeat business, which is a shame. But really need to invest a bit into the place, and train some staff to make guest feel special if in the hospitality business.

735,Parpadelle,Food,Arundel, Restaurant,13,What an unbelievable experience...,"Never in 40 years of eating out around the world, have I been so utterly flabbergasted and very distressed... after eating many many times at this restaurant over past two years with many friends, and served by the lovely restaurant staff... I went for lunch today (Thursday 3rd Jan). Being fully aware and accepting of the ""round table"" policy, I made a polite enquiry regarding it being acceptable to sit there as we were a table of two. I was assured by the waitress that it was fine. After a few minutes perusing menus and having ordered our drinks we were asked (by a different ""waitress"") to move to the ""long shared table"" as a party of three had arrived .I politely suggested that there was evidently room for three at the long shared table (albeit involved requesting someone move along a seat at the ""shared long table"") and that it was not reasonable to ask us to move. The ""waitress"" (whom I now believe to be... is apparently the owners wife) then made a sarcastic confrontational comment about my lack of co-operation, and re-iterated the policy in ear shot of all... (which I had previously confirmed with staff was OK). While this was going on, my guest moved us both to the end of the long table as it had been kindly and pro-actively vacated by another couple... the same ""owner's wife"" lady then proceeded to snatch away our drinks and menus and announced that she was refusing to serve us and wanted us to leave... simultaneously shouting across the crowded restaurant that ""I had been rude to her on several previous occasions""... never having to my knowledge met or spoken with this lady before this was both unbecoming and untrue. I objected to this treatment and questioned her observations and commitment to the hospitality industry, maintaining at all time a civil tongue. She then decided to suggest inviting her husband downstairs to which I agreed. Her husband was not prepared to entertain any explanation from me and asked me to leave which I immediately agreed to do. He stated that ""he knew his wife well enough"".... of that I have no doubt. Maybe she would be better suited to an alternative role away from FOH. Very upset, and truly very concerned for her level of stress/anger/honesty, and now reluctantly unwilling to return if that customer service is considered policy.
Based on other reviews and the untruthful allegations made on the day, I fully expect this to be treated as an inaccurate account, however why would I? I can assure you this is 100% to the best of my recollection. I am very upset. Possibly she mistook me for someone else? - if that is an excuse? I loved eating in your restaurant. Feedback is a gift. Seek to improve rather than defend. Trust me I have over 20 years experience in Customer Service training design and delivery... and this is free!",1,1.0,1.0,Italian/Pizza,1
736,Angmering Manor,Accommodation,Littlehampton,Hotel,126,Big disappointment ,"I was looking for wood to staying at Angmering Manor because the website looked really good. When we arrived our room looked nothing like the pictures on the website. It was very small, the en suite smelt damp, the shower had black mould on the grouting, lightbulbs weren’t working, the wardrobe was a tiny cupboard in the eves and we had to bend down to hang clothes up.

We went into the garden to have drink and the garden was very pretty. However only very few of the rattan chairs had cushions on, and the glass table was absolutely filthy. We intended eating in the restaurant but this put us off and we went into the village instead.

The good points: the bedding was good quality, the towels fluffy, and whilst the breakfast was very basic, with limited choice, the eggs were very nicely poached.

This is a low-budget 2 star hotel with a 4 star label and even worse - 4 star prices. We paid £129 for one night for this sub-standard room!!!

Thankfully we’d only booked for one night. Never again!!

To our dismay the service was unkind and cold. We were not offered more drinks when glasses were empty. Two of the party had the peppercorn chicken pasta, and it was just totally bland. When asked if we wanted parmesan, the waitress leant straight over in front of one of the party and over her plate, her elbow less than an inch from her face, to reach my plate. Seems like an update in staff training with regards to hospitality is needed. When told it was my birthday, they did not think to say a simple 'happy birthday', just muttered and walked off! Staff did not say even a 'thank you' when we paid the bill and left. Sadly, you have lost a loyal customer. I did not have the heart to complain during service last night, as I did not want my parents to think this shoddy experience had ruined my birthday meal.

741,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,60,Lovely Location - Tatty Hotel,"Where to begin – this is definitely not the standard of hotel synonymous with the Hilton Brand, in my opinion it is the worst Hilton I have stayed in to date! The hotel is in desperate need of a major refurb, the creaking floorboards threadbare carpets and scruffy walls in the corridors are very off putting. The building itself is charming and with some serious investment it could be a lovely venue. Our room had recently been painted and although small was generally clean – I did, however make the mistake of looking out of the window to find that the windowsill was filthy and covered in dust & cobwebs – which was a shame as the rest of the room was fine. There are also no lifts available so if you have mobility issues be sure to request a room on the ground floor. There was no air-con in our room, although there was a very noisy metal fan supplied, so it was a toss up as to whether the heat or the noise kept you awake at night. The reception staff on check in were very helpful and efficient – not so good on check-out (different staff) who seemed to be struggling with the busy period. We also found the bar staff to be very helpful and friendly – but the drinks are over priced – £12.50 for a large glass of Sauvignon Blanc! The biggest shambles was definitely breakfast time – we headed down at 08.45 and there was a very long queue, we were eventually seated at a table – only to be moved on by a very angry customer when he returned from fetching his breakfast a few minutes later – so back to the desk to wait for another available table, without so much as an apology from the lady who sat us down in the first place! It was a very hit and miss affair with some tables being offered teas & coffees and others being left to fend for themselves. Admittedly it was a very busy breakfast session, but the wait for certain hot items (eggs/bacon/sausages) was ridiculously long, the remaining items were congealing on your plate before the stocks were replenished, and when I asked a member of staff how much longer the wait would be, I was informed by her that it wasn’t her department so I would just have to wait as one of her colleagues would deal with it! After a wait of over 45 minutes (from initially queuing) we decided that enough was enough, and left without bothering. We would have complained there and then but couldn't find anyone to complain to - and after the attitude of the member of staff we did talk to anout the food issues, we thought we'd be wasting our breath anyway. This Hilton was terrible value for money, and to be honest I have stayed in better budget hotels, definitely one I will avoid in future!

Beautiful olde world charm, reminiscent of the ‘close-by castle’ days, but rooms inside modern, airy and oh so comfortable. We had 2 rooms, both had been upgraded (for whatever reason), so thanks for that 😜. But clean, comfy and so centrally situated. Morning breakfast in the bar - fresh tasty ingredients and beautifully cooked and presented. Just one gripe - stairs up to the rooms and down to the rear parking (pay and display) were grubby with fluff and dirt and looked as though they had not been vacuumed for days, maybe weeks.

My hubbys burger arrived and the chips were just soggy, the waitress (who was lovely) asked how our meal was and I mentioned mine was cold and hubby didnt even answer she just said she would report it to the kitchen. After we half finished our meal we decided to call it a day not even bothering with the free pudding, the waitress did say, was everything ok and we did complain, the manager came over and apologised and said the chips were cut this morning, can’t help thinking they were cooked this morning too! He did take our drinks off the bill £8, but I feel taking one of the meals off at £15.95 and £13.95 would have been better as we left a lot and we enjoyed there drinks!

We arrived on Christmas Day and were seated at a table in the conservatory area on the opposite side of the restaurant and it’s as if we were completely forgotten about. No Christmas decorations in this area and absolutely no atmosphere. We waited almost an hour for our starters and then almost another hour for our main courses. The majority of the food was lukewarm at best and when someone on our table asked for mustard, they were told there wasn’t any. The wrong food was also brought out several times. A table next to us were brought out desserts before they’d had their main courses! We also asked for some jugs of water for the table and were told they didn’t have any jugs available.

The cocktails were expensive, poor tasting and very weak. i asked for a cocktail not a fruit juice...

i was certainly holding out for the burger. i ordered 2 - the flamin chicken burger (My wife also ordered this), which was flamin wrong - a whole block of stilton appeared to be smothered on top of the dry crispy chicken; the smell of which made me feel sick - buyers beware...A little tip to the restaurateur's - perhaps put the stilton on the side so you don't ruin the burger for everyone? The second burger, a fairly reasonable gourmet beef burger with bacon and cheddar, caramelised onion, lettuce, pickles in a brioche bun which i would give a 3 out of 5. For desert i ordered a sticky toffee pudding, hoping that my sweet tooth would provide solace. i was given a Cold sticky toffee pudding that stuck to the roof of my mouth forever churning like a cement mixer..come on guys, Chef Mic (rowave) cant even help you here...

Moreover, Already complaining about the copious amounts of Stilton on the burger, a cheque comes to the table, and i see the flamin chicken burger x 2 were still on the bill. One of which had bacon added (£1.50) in addition, did this little piggy run away as i never received the bacon. We again complained and management kindly decided to give us 50% OFF ONE burger after ordering 3 burgers, 3 cocktails, beers and a desert i thought our server was joking.

What is advertised on their website isn't what we got. They advertise a carvery, live cooking stations and theme nights including Tex-Mex, Italian, Indian and Chinese. We saw none of these and on phoning Butlins we were initially told that due to an overspill we were given Food Court dining by mistake. On complaining we were then told we were miss-advised and we did get Premium dining even though we didn't even get a sniff of any of the above. You will also waste your time with the complaints department as they need a complaints department to deal with the complaints about their complaints department. If they have done this to us then how many other families have not got what they paid for? A totally shocking experience from what is supposed to be a family based company.
I am now having to go through the legal route due to the false advertising on their website and am building a case against them through social media as they just don't care. They also said they could not log this as a complaint as this was not done within the 28 days after our stay even though we have just recently found out that we didn't get the Premium dining as first thought - this is a very sneaky way of keeping their complaints stats down.

It was so nice to be able to stay in a place that respects our dog as much as we do. He had treats and poo bags and bowls for water and food and was told he could sit on the sofa - what more could a doggy ask for! All that was missing was a dog walking and grooming service (hint hint). We stayed in the most brilliant room with a four poster bed a wonderful view of the gardens (helipad included) and the sea in the distance.

For us, the spa was amazing - really lovely staff and great facilities including outdoor and indoor pools with hot tubs in lovely setting. There are beautiful walks around, on the hotel grounds and beyond.. we saw lots of Great British wildlife including the cutest owls on the hotel grounds.

The only negatives for us were number 1: the food. It was very over priced. It was good / fine! But that was all. Not £68 for 3 courses at dinner level of good. Dinner on day two was a little cheaper but wasn’t quite there either. Breakfast was also just good / nice. Nothing special at all. And number 2: the water pressure in our room was so bad that we had to shower in the spa. Filling the bath took an age and the shower was just a dribble.

We spoke to other guests during our stay that said the same thing regarding the food so I hope that the hotel can take this on board and make a few tweaks! I would expect a fine dining tasting menu at this price and have paid less for much better but I’ll leave that there.

Regardless, we will go back Im sure because the staff were great and the place is a bit special and it’s just brilliant to have our dog share a weekend away in style with us.

I would love to leave 5 stars! Maybe next time ;)

The food when it arrives is really nice, well cooked and presented well even if it is over priced.

Being an old manor, we thought Avisford Park might in fact offer a little more appeal than usual. Unfortunately we were disappointed. This hotel looks so tired and is in desperate need of an upgrade and modernisation. Carpets are worn, walls are scuffed, the beds are very hard and it really is not a four star hotel.
Our room was large and airy but it was old fashioned - in a bad way - no character here. The bathroom was very dated.
Although the food served at breakfast was satisfactory, service at breakfast was poor and the young staff need some training. It was all very basic.
How can this be a Hilton? We will bypass it next time if we are ever in the area again. There are plenty of other nice hotels in the area to choose from.

811,The Diner,Food,Bognor, Steakhouse/Diner,1,"Excruciatingly slow service, average food","Like some other reviewers on here, we as a family of 6 also experienced extremely poor and slow service. We had pre-booked a table for 6:15 two days earlier but it was 50 minutes before our drinks order arrived at our table, even though we could see the tray sitting on the bar counter for about 15 minutes. There were several staff rushing about but the phrase “headless chickens” would seem appropriate here as they didn’t seem to actually be DOING anything other than trying to look busy and keep moving! The diner wasn’t at maximum capacity by any means.

Our food finally arrived about 1.5 hours after we’d been seated. Our 5 year old and 2 year old granddaughters had to be given snacks by their mum whilst waiting for the food as they were hungry by then and understandably bored by the wait. Well behaved nonetheless. The food itself was average at best and not great value for money. We decided we would all like a dessert afterwards but by the time the waitress was ready to take our order (at least another half an hour after our table was cleared), we had all lost patience and this unacceptable delay meant our granddaughters had already missed the tots disco on their last night that they’d been so looking forward to.

In summary, it would seem some cover times are more efficiently managed than others (avoid Thursday evenings!). The food is average. Staff not particularly friendly and certainly not helpful. The place is not child friendly in terms of waiting times. Allow at least 2 to 2.5 hours if you plan on a timed activity afterwards. The manager needs replacing asap if this restaurant wants to turn a profit. Just our table alone lost them six desserts’ worth of business.

821,Mr P's Classic Amusements,Attractions,Bognor,Amusements/Fun,8,A lot of room for improvement,"I write my review based on visiting all of the Mr P arcades. I will not waffle on but here is the basics.

For starters, not all of the machines are on their best payout percentages. Their website claims they have the best percentage payouts, this may be true in comparison to other amusements but losing £1000 through a £70 jackpot machine is definitely not 90%.

Any machine player will generally know if a machine is worth playing. A sign for this is “being full up”. Mr P arcades refill their machines and I have experienced this personally many times in each branch. For example, a party time could be full, the coins are dropping, you win £50 collect it and only pays £19 before going empty, then they refill or flick the hopper top up switch after only refloating £31. The next player then thinks it’s full up but does his balls in.

The arcade opening times are very early to close, however, if you are a promoter of their business via youtube, they will stay open till all hours for you, but not to normal customers.

The owners will lend people money who they get on well with, but others they will not, not very professional.

The staff will empty machines whilst you go for a fag or to the bank.

The arcades never ever have enough pound coins in, staff always have to empty machines half way through playing to get coins.

No loyalty rewards given, where as other arcades you get some kind of rewards. However you do get some free play each visit, on certain machines.

Often machines spend weeks out of use because the owners do not drive. The staff on site do not generally know how to fix the machines when they malfunction.

The air conditioning is pretty much non existent in all 3 arcades. It’s very hot in summer and stuffy most days.

You may get refreshments but that has been abused so seems to be cut back a bit.

All in all, the machines are there for “nostalgia” and certainly as with any arcades you cannot “make money” from, it’s all entertainment. You can get lucky, or you can be very unlucky.

The reason for my low score is that the brand continues to maintain they are this that and the other but in fact they are not. I’ve seen various lies, various untoward behaviour, very unfair ethics. All customers should be treated the same, whoever they are. Opening and closing should be set. Filming of other arcade users without their permission should not be allowed. They will write essays on their social media to portray they are amazing people, which some fall for, but let’s face it - they are only in it for the money in reality, nobody starts a business just for the love, otherwise they would be skint in no time.",2,4.0,0.0,0,1

We’ve stayed in various accommodations and this time opted for a silver room (which we have stayed in in the past) and as previous visits it’s was spotless. The beds were comfy, the rooms were warm. (We were missing an ironing board but that was soon sorted by guest services)
The staff/redcoats were so helpful, polite and cheerful. There was lots for the children to do, most of which is included in the price. The skyline gang are a favourite of my sons, and they were as wonderful as ever.
We opted for food court dining this time, there was plenty of choice and the food was fine. Certainly worth doing rather than self catering, in my opinion.
We loved the Paddington show, and Justin was great. As normal for the big acts, the queue for Justin was crazy. I was expecting this as I’ve been before. We joined the queue at 5.40pm and the doors opened at 6pm and we had decent enough seats for us and our 4 year old. I personally don’t buy into the b-line passes.

We approached the bar & were asked what we’d like. Slightly disappointed that cocktails were not an option, and extremely embarrassed when suddenly we were accused of jumping the queue! What queue?! Apparently it’s what you do we were told from behind the pole, a fair distance away! To be reprimanded by the arrogant male bar tender & ridiculed by a group of young girls (who’s ID I hope were checked!), was embarrassing & totally unnecessary. My point to the management is simply this. If you wish your customers to form orderly queue at an empty bar some 8 feet away from the bar (especially when its empty)please make this clear by placing a sign for all newcomers like ourselves to avoid further unpleasant confrontations.

The food came out quickly. My wife’s roast beef was dry and tough, my lamb felt like it had come out of the microwave. I think you can tell a lot by the roast potatoes on a roast dinner and once again they where dried up and tough!

At no point during the meal did anyone come and check on us or offer more drinks. We had a desert board plonked on the table after waiting 15 minutes for our plates to be cleared away.

The black rabbit was a lovely place and holds some good memories for my wife and I, but I won’t be recommending it again, and I don’t think I’ll be visiting for a long while.

If you’re looking for a cracking roast, try The Corner House in Worthing. It’s just been promoted to top of my list of places to go for a roast. Got to say for post meal satisfaction the Toby Carvery beats the black Rabbit on today’s performance.",2,2.0,0.0,British,1

841,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,11,Christmas Fantasy,"We visited on 14th December 2018 for the Christmas Fantasy experience. We stayed in a self catering apartment in Guillemot way and it was very basic and in need of some thorough cleaning/repairs and TLC.
We arrived a bit late on the Friday and struggled to get parked, I had to get out leaving my partner with the car and kids in order to grab the keys and welcome pack to get in to our apartment as we couldn't find anywhere near to park. It was dark and I struggled to find guest services as I had never been there before (they do not have drive in check in desks like they do in Skegness).
We eventually found our apartment and it was really quite far for us to walk with all our belongings, a baby and two toddlers.
The parking situation is terrible, you have to get there early to get a space, we got there about 8pm and it was stressful trying to offload our belongings, our family and finding a space to park.
The first full day the weather was bad and all the outdoor activities were cancelled which meant that everyone was crammed in to the Skyline and it was horrific, the soft play area was bursting at the seams and we could see children getting knocked over by kids running past so we didn't let ours go in (much to their disappointment), there was not enough tables for us to sit down at and it was hard to see anything on stage as everyone was standing at the sides so you couldn't see anything let alone the toddlers trying to see. It was a struggle walking past as there were people EVERYWHERE trying to watch the entertainment and blocking the way past. There were queues for most things and a noticeable amount of parents having a lot to drink and ignoring their feral children, sometimes you would hear some of them swearing loudly and it made me feel uncomfortable as I don't want my children to be exposed to language like that.
In our guest pack we received tickets to see Santa in the Character theatre at 7pm on Saturday 15th Dec (which I thought was a bit late for a 2 and 4 year old), we assumed there was a show but when we got there we just got in to a long queue on the left hand side of the theatre, the kids called out for Santa who came out on a stage, then just sat down with the kids in their respective family groups on stage, had a brief chat with them, gave them a chocolate selection box and posed for a photo before being told to exit the other side of the stage. A couple of minutes at the most, pretty disappointing.
I have since found out from other people who went at the same time as us, that they all saw a Christmas show in the theatre or had a private Santa experience in his grotto so I'm baffled as to why we didn't receive either of those experiences.
We ate at Papa J's restaurant, it wasn't particularly busy and a few things were forgotten by the staff I.e. plates for the children despite asking for them twice so my partner and I ate our meals off the plates the starters came on. The food was absolutely delicious and fairly good value for money in comparison to some of the other places, I would definitely recommend eating here.
The swimming pool changing rooms were dirty, like really dirty and not necessarily from people using it that day but in desperate need of a deep clean. There were dirty nappies on the floor, bodily fluids including blood smears and bogeys on the walls and the floor was filthy.
I didn't see anyone cleaning in there at any stage, not even wiping the changing room floor which meant we had to put towels down in order to get changed and not get completely covered in dirt which meant our towels were so dirty we couldn't go swimming again during our stay.
We had forgotten the baby's swimming costume and had to look for a suitable suit, well there was only a pair of cheaply made trunks (nothing else in his size) and it cost us £10!!! I mean come on, his little swimsuit from Next didn't even cost that much, it really did take me aback but needs must. Well the trunks didn't fit him in the slightest they were massively too big and kept falling down, I feel that this aspect should be looked in to by Butlins as the trunks were incorrectly sized and extortionate, almost taking advantage of people who have no alternative.
During our time in the pool my partner took my little boy to the loo where a two young lads (one was a lifeguard and the other was dressed all in red) were having a loud conversation about one of the lads having an STI!!! Thankfully my little boy wasn't listening as we didn't fancy explaining to him what an STI was and it's a wholly inappropriate conversation to be having in a place mainly full of children.
By Sunday we had had enough so went off the site and went to Bognor beach and pier for the day and ate in a local pub, The Regis (Brewers fayre) which also had a soft play inside which the kids loved, we returned back to Butlins and decided to pack up and leave early (was due to stay until Monday).
All in all a bit of a let down and wouldn't recommend.

We took our 18 month old daughter and although she obviously couldn’t do everything, there was plenty of things to keep her entertained and us.
The resort was clean and well kept.
We also included the food deal on our package which was so good, lots of choice and really well cooked. Would definitely recommend doing it, although even if you choose not to then there is plenty of places to eat when you are there.

They said that it wasn’t what they had ordered, and even suggested that it was probably mine, but even so the waitress left it with them in their table. A couple of minutes later, one of our other breakfasts arrived, correctly to our table. Shortly after that, they realised that my breakfast was wrongly given to the other table. By this time it had been sat there for about 5 minutes, but they just took it from that table, and passed it to me! Meanwhile, our other breakfast had not arrived. I asked twice where it was, to be told that the chef is alone, and was very busy. By the time the third breakfast arrived, (about 45 minutes from the point of ordering), we had eaten the other two!!

Was informed that they didn't have any calamari and would I be happy with scampi instead. Not a problem. I asked for me steak to be cooked medium rare. When it arrived it was still mooing! Completely rare. I sent it back and had to wait for a replacement meal. In the meantime my son ate his meal on his own. When I got my meal the steak was cooked ok. I peeled my prawns and took a bite. As I did so I looked down and realised that they were completely raw in the middle!!! I spat out what I had. By then I'd had enough. Appetite killed. When we received the bill we were told that they hadn't charged for my meal. I thought well seeing as I hadn't eaten anything damn right. They also didn't charge for our 2 beers plus gave us 40% discount off my sons meal. I could've landed up extremely ill last night with food poisoning. We will not be going back anytime soon.

Beware,"On arrival we - 2 adults with our 2-year-old baby were stopped in front of their entrance stating a child is not allowed. Although booking was done via Hotels.com, Lady came up with a paper stating our booking through Expedia is for 2 adults only. Hotels.com had no answer as to why owner had Expedia reference and said they can’t help as child wasn’t mentioned while booking.
Room information on hotels.com stated room accommodates 2 adults and child if child shares bed with parents. B&B’s website states children are welcome. Despite of this they said children are not allowed and closed the door.
Our fault that we did not confirm baby while booking. The thought of this being a problem never came into our mind as baby co-sleeps with us occasionally and we booked a king size bed for that night. We told hotels.com about the treatment that we got there and we had no intention to stay with such uncourteous Owners. Finally, after a struggle of an hour, we arranged alternative accommodation via google. Before moving we just knocked on their door to show their own website policy, to which one of the owners said, ok then a child and mum can stay in the room and also tried to make fun in a sarcastic way. We understood they are after making money without letting us in, hence we left to the next hotel by cursing their rude behaviour.

I do not have a problem with the calvary sure the meat portions are a bit small and the roast potatoes not always very convincing, my disappointment is the decline of some of the once amazing deserts!
They once had an apple pie that had melt in the mouth pastry that was so delicious in so generous a portion that many people shared!
This obviously couldn't carry on it was too good value and totally eclipsed the other deserts so when it was taken off the menu l found two tasty alternatives the apple and pear crumble (more like a dinky little pie tbh)or a tasty little bannofee ensemble.
Today was my birthday and l selected the apple and pear but what a disappointment the crumble was like flakes of tasteless cake crumbs on top of apple that was either pretty raw or had not been defrosted.
When l complained l was told the chef said it has been changed and the apple is fine.
I did receive a refund and declined choosing an alternative.

I needn't have worried!

From the warm welcome to the moment we left, we had a great time. When we first entered 'the room', it looked a little sparse, somewhat akin to some of my student digs from the past (albeit much cleaner). I didn't think there could possibly be enough to keep our 'clever' minds and 'highly tuned (ahem!)' bodies engaged for the full time. How wrong I was! Aside from the countless visible locks, as you delved and dug deeper, there were plenty of puzzles to solve, clues to find and things to work out to keep us all fully engaged and entertained for (almost) the full hour. Yes we did escape but, if I'm honest, only because of the few useful hints that came across the radio to point us back in the right direction.

This is a fun and fairly inexpensive way to sped an afternoon or start an evening. I gather the clues change every few months, so it can be done more than once. One thing is for sure though, it has given me the bug and I will be booking up another Escape Room in the near future.",5,1.0,2.0,0,0

We were stressed tired and fed up when we came across 2 security guards Mark and cassie. I cannot thank these people enough for their help assistance and compassion. They found a member of hotel staff to allocate us an adapted room. Cassie was especially good with my mom who is disabled due to a brain tumour. She pushed her wheelchair and spoke to her with genuine interest and respect. She oriented my mom to our room turning on lights and shutting curtains tiny things that made a massive difference. As a nurse i see people in the care profession that so not have as much empathy as cassie showed us that night and I cannot thank her enough. Mark insisted on helping my dad unload the car.

When we arrived for our evening meal Liz (our waitress), who had been there for seventeen years looked after us and Hannah, the manager was also on hand to make sure everything was ok.

They chef, who had been made aware of our dietary requirements had actually taken the time to prepare a special meal just for us based on our whole food plant-based diet.

This restaurant and its staff went above and beyond and we were humbled by their willingness to help and accommodate us.

The food was absolutely amazing.

So, if you are a vegetarian, vegan or on a whole-food plant-based diet I can highly recommend this restaurant.

They are friendly, caring and hugely customer-focussed.

Had the sea food platter as a main course and was not disappointed. The muscles in a creamy source with plenty of bread to share was lovely. The calamari and tempora prawns were crispy and golden and the sweat chilli source complimented this dish. Possibly a little too much batter served on this platter, I would personally ask for the prawns without batter next time. Others in our group had the Thai salmon and prawn curry and were full of compliments. The children’s menu was ideal for our two boys and the table mat activities kept them entertained.

The Valentine's menu is best described as ""interesting"" - nicely-cooked but what we'd describe as ""specialist"" dishes rather than the pub's usual varied tasty home-cooked fare. However, what really spoiled our evening was the service. We were the first couple to occupy one of a group of four tables, which later filled up, but by the end of the evening we were still waiting for our desserts after all the other three sets of guests had finished their meals and left. We asked several times if we could have the course we were waiting for and got a surly ""it's on its way"" followed by further waiting. Before our desserts arrived, the server cleared our table of everything; our napkins, our cutlery, and the rose in its vase. My wife asked if she could have the rose and it was dumped on the table in front of her. When our desserts finally came and we'd eaten them, we felt the attitude towards us was ""hurry up and leave"", when the delay was all of their making, so we didn't bother with coffee, paid up and left.

The restaurant is themed as a castle banquet, my only gripe would be i asked for a Caesar salad however was served mixed leaves with french dressing?!?!, I asked for a Caesar salad and they just added Caesar dressing on top!?!?!. You are paying restaurant prices therefore if they serving Caesar salad, it should be with Cos lettuce etc. I was disappointed with this!

Baklava to finish and reasonably priced wine.

This is a highly unprofessional way to conduct business, and this has only been reinforced by this page in which you can see the owner ARGUING with customers who have dared to leave negative feedback, instead of reaching out to find ways in which the establishment may improve.

Not to stereotype, but generally it is not in your typical Brit's nature to go to the extent of giving negative feedback (we will normally just put up and leave, never to return), and the fact that there are multiple comments discussing the rudeness of the staff on this page says enough.

I ordered fish and chips and was given a receipt to which I placed in my pocket. The gentleman in question later shouted out ''pie, burger and chips'' directed at me, to which I stated was not my order. he then shouted ''what number'' and I said that I didn't understand.

Now, I've eaten there several times and have never been asked for a number. After a little while, I noticed that my receipt actually had a number on it, so I then presented this to him. The said gentlemen made some very sarcastic and rude comments saying ''this is why we give number to ticket, I say number you no stand there, you tell me number yes''. he continued to yell at me and I couldn't actually speak over the volume of his aggressive tone.

I requested that he is not rude to me and that it's wrong to belittle a customer and speak with sarcasm. I also stated that his tone was unprofessional and that he wasn't clear originally, which caused the confusion. Bizarrely, the gentleman started shouting at me regarding his disabled eye and I have no idea why or what he was trying to say.

I have never before been shouted at by a member of staff as a customer, nor spoken to with such rudeness. It's especially unreasonable because I never spoke out of turn or even raised my voice.

Anyway they ""upgraded"" us to the Wave Hotel.
The hotel was surprisingly quite nice, friendly staff, we were on the 4th floor with a balcony, we had to bring the chairs in off the balcony because of the kids. mini fridge didn't work so we complained and they replaced it the next day.
They activities for toddlers are a bit limited, firstly the large soft play thing in the main tent kids have to be 0.9m they've section off part of it for toddlers but its really crap its just 3 floors to climb up and 1 slide to get down from the middle to ground floor that's it.. no ball pit nothing.
The fair ground rides they have be 0.9m or 1m even with a parent and the toddler fairground inside the tent was only a couple of rides which our girls didn't want to go on without us which we couldn't go on. we ended up spending a fortune on the little arcade rides £1 a go.

For a start if you look at the photographs of the double rooms you will see that the same photograph is used for different types of double rooms but the daily price is different. We could find nowhere on the site that informed guests that there was no lift. When we booked in we asked for a room with a stand in shower (we should have asked for a walking one) as my partner has arthritis and has difficulty in bending we were shown a room on the fourth floor, up four flights of stairs. The room had a shower over the bath which was unsuitable for us. We asked for a room on a lower floor with a walking shower but all showers are over the bath. The rooms are rather dated and not suitable at all for people with any form of disability. We decided not to stay, which was a pity, the Hotel should make very clear that there is no lift and are not really suited to people who are even slightly disabled.

1000,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,4,Discriminating behaviour towards my little girl by a lady staff member named HAYLEIGH at Butlins Bognor Regis Resort,"On our 2nd night at the resort, we attended a family event at the Reds venue where we had a very nasty experience with a red coat staff member named HAYLEIGH. She singled out my 5 yr old girl and stopped ONLY her from taking a picture with the Mr. Potato head character.
When I saw my little girl close to tears I approached HAYLEIGH and requested politely to grant her just one picture as she was the last child in line. I would have understand if there were more children behind her and all asked to leave but to ask just the last child out??? I was told rudely by her that they had already done the countdown to end the photo shoot and that ‘ I should have used my ears to listen better’ !!!! She also said that instead of dancing with my little son on the dance floor,I should have ‘paid more attention to the queue’.
I was extremely shocked at her condemning manner and reminded her that after the countdown five other white families had stood in the queue in front of my girl and had been granted a picture and why was she, the only one to be left out? Also, what does me dancing with my son have anything to do with my daughter who was waiting her turn patiently in the queue????
What is worse is that my daughter had only joined the queue (after the countdown) once I checked with the male photographer there. He later denied any responsibility saying that he was just there to take pictures! When I reminded HAYLEIGH that such an attitude towards a guest and a child was not acceptable, she very arrogantly pointed to her name tag and asked me to report to whoever I liked, it made no difference to her! She spent about 2-3 mins arguing with me and the Mr Potato head character remained in the background but she couldn’t use a minute of that time to make a little girl happy????

We have been to many other family resorts and have never experienced anything like this. In fact, most other places go out of their way to make the little ones feel special. We were initially very impressed by the Butlins resort, the ocean hotel room, the pool zone and entertainment shows where we did see friendly and attentive staff like the hotel receptionist Kirstie and most staff at the pavilion arcade. I am surprised that someone like this lady Hayleigh works in a resort of this stature as she definitely has a problem with brown/dark skin and clearly does not know how to communicate with guests.
I strongly condemn such obnoxious and discriminating behaviour in a place that claims to be dedicated to families and fun. As parents we did not spend our hard earned money, for our daughter to feel inadequate and reduced to tears just before her birthday! (she didn’t want to attend most character events at the resort after that). We checked out of the resort a day earlier than needed and must say that we have been extremely disappointed by Butlins on this occasion.

1001,Swan Hotel,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,63,"Unfortunately, not a ‘LUXURY’ Stay!!!","We stayed here on Halloween as it was our 1 year Wedding Anniversary. I had requested through booking.com for the hotel to do ‘anything they could to make our stay extra special’ with it being our anniversary. This was confirmed back that the hotel would do this. I had no idea or thought as to what that would actually be, but anything to add a special touch would have been lovely. This did not happen which was really disappointing as it was confirmed they would do something. We Got into our room and I have to say, for £124 and the ‘LUXURY’ room, I was very underwhelmed! We needed an iron so rang down for one, the lad said he’d be straight up. Approx an hour later, I rang again and he’d forgotten as it was very busy at the bar and he was on his own. 5 minutes later, he brought the iron. Whilst waiting for the iron, I had a shower in what should have been a flawless bathroom but there was mould around door edges, the shower and the middle of the ceiling. Again, not what you’d expect for a ‘luxury’ room. We went out for tea through the night exit / entrance and found it left on the latch which is a security concern, I took it off to make sure it was closed properly. Got back to the room and I tried to watch the Telly but it was wonky, I tried to straighten it but realised the bracket itself was wonky so I left it!! The lighting in the room at night is quite dark and my wife found it very hard to do her makeup, resorting to using her phone torch!!
The next morning I put the cases on the car and again, the night entrance was on the latch so anyone could walk in off the street! I went to breakfast and picked up my side plate to get a croissant, I thought the plate was stained as I could see a yellow tint on it and then realised it was actually a Dirty plate!!!!! The breakfast was very good and they catered for my specific requests, it was just very disappointing that we kept finding issues. I wanted to make sure I told the hotel about our experience and did at the bar. The person I spoke to did not fill me the confidence that she would pass on my concerns so I emailed the Hotel. I have accepted a refund for my stay, which is fine......I just wish they’d got it right on the night though!!! I have given the hotel a 2 star as we did not experience ‘LUXURY’ and I was told I would be contacted Monday morning for the refund and I actually had to ring up around 6pm to sort it!!!
If in Arundel again, I’ll try somewhere else instead.

The shoreline hotel went above and beyond with cute little displays as seen below when we came back to our room, all clean and fresh when we arrived and rooms very well equipped with an empty fridge and helpful shelves and clothes rack, just very well designed rooms with a little play area. High powered shower which was very enjoyable. Beds were definitely comfier than the self catering we have experienced with springs before and most people were considerate with the noise they made after a certain time in the evening. We did actually get some sleep, unusual for a hotel on a resort.

We had two accidents whilst we were here and the staff were 100% supportive and caring especially the first aiders who attended my daughter. Very helpful suggestions and recommending further help from other sources if needed. They even dropped by our room on the day after to check on my daughter and follow up.

So many staff to thank for making our stay excellent. Nothing was too much and all smiling and kind to children, they all seemed to enjoy their jobs which is nice to see good morale.

The pub and kitchen is by far the best restaurant in the place with fresh home cooked food, hot and delivered in a good time on the 2 occasions we visited. Being served by Tony who went above and beyond, the service was second to none. We tried The Diner, which took ages to get food and it wasnt anything special, although the staff were lovely. We tried papa John's for free delivery to our room, which was prompt but the food went in the bin as pizza was swimming in grease and soggie and undercooked in the middle. The fish and chip shop had lovely staff and service was excellent but the chips looked reheated and odd colour, my daughters chicken nuggets were dry and chewy and my pie was dry and over cooked and food was slow to be received too. I wouldnt revisit any of the food venues apart from the pub and kitchen. The crepe stand was very tasty too and reasonably priced.

After the amount i paid for a ""deluxe room"" to make the occasion special, it annoyed me to my core to hear that friends who had paid a percentage of what i had were offered suites and rooms of the highest standards. Friends of mine had also lost their suites due to other peoples upgrades.
We wanted to have a nice family meal before the big day and after ordering 10 meals for the table, we then waited forover an hour in what was an empty restaurant. We were made aware of the extra wait for BBQ food but anything over an hour it would of been appreciated if we were made aware of the status of the food. Eventualy the food did turn up albeit it the wrong orders and therefore leaving me still with a hungry stomach. I was scared that if i ordered more i would be there well into the night. Not ideal prep for a long wedding day. We did have our drinks removed from the bill but even the drinks took over 20 minutes to arrive. it was only a nudge from my friend who was fed up of waiting , who went to the bar himself to get a separate drink as it was a hot day and was parched (34*)
On the day of the wedding i needed to iron a number of shirts which luckily was not a problem as the room had all of the utilities it promised. ALTHOUGH even with the iron only half full it decided to leak all over my shirt leaving a water stain. It was at this point that my opinion on the Hilton Hotel brand had been tarnished. To the point where on the last day of my stay at 11:15 i stood at the downstairs bar in an attempt to get a fruit shoot for one of the kids and was unable to due to NO STAFF manning the bar which i had been directed too. This was not a busy time of the day and i had to walk away and disappoint the child of my failure to provide a sweet beverage in what was one of the hottest days of the year.

Main courses included Dover sole which contained so many bones it was inedible . This was replaced with a meal of smoked haddock which my son said smelled off & did not get eaten. Another person who had the haddock said it was over cooked & the spinach was crunchy with sand or earth
My husband had the duck which was over cooked. The ribs were only average, not really smoked correctly.

Any taste came from the icing and basically from the sugar within, which only merited a couple of mouthfuls and nothing more. Family experience similar with an eclair and tart. Coffee was ok, but just average.

If a coffee shop I’d give a two for the welcome, but when this is trying to specialise as a patisserie and fails so miserably on that point it has to be a 1.

20:50 - food arrives 45 mins later than ordered and 35 mins after their own estimated time.

I asked the delivery driver to wait whilst I checked everything was there as I had now been waiting for 2 hours. Am dismissively told ""we're busy"". Food is cold and has leaked over the bag. Delivery driver says ""okay?"" I replied ""not really"" and he walked off.

After moving away several years ago, my wife & I visited on a recent Saturday evening but were rather disappointed. I ordered a beer and received two. I was touched that the owner had remembered me and gave me a free beer, as he used to do sometimes in the past, however there were two beers on the bill at the end.
We ordered onion bajhi and chotpoti for starters .These were quite ok.
I ordered Chicken Moglhai and my wife ordered butter duck.
When the food arrived, it seemed my wife's butter duck was actually duck korma (not even remotely similar) and my moglhai seemed the almost same sauce. Both dishes were unbearably sweet so we could only manage to eat about 1/2 each before giving up.
Not wishing to make a fuss we just paid the bill & left disappointed. I was more disappointed with the owner's loss of enthusiasm for his restaurant that the food. He used to be such a lovely, friendly guy but now he seems to be walking around like royalty looking down on everyone.

We took our drinks to a table for 4 with 4 tub chairs, 2 of which had no cushions. We fetched cushions from other chairs and sat to “enjoy” our drinks.

When we got there a member of staff asked us if we were there for food or just drinks, we said just drinks, she said that's fine, and showed us to a table. We ordered two hot chocolates that came after about 10 minutes.
The band were setting up, all was fine,
Then one of the members of staff came over just as i had my last mouthful of my drink, she bent down next to our table and asked us to move because some customers had come in. I thought that rather odd as we were also customers and it was only a small table so not as if we were using a table that a larger group would want. I tend to avoid confrontation so started to gather my purse, phone, jacket etc, and asked where to move to, I was completely shocked at her reply. She said ' well go '. I couldn't believe it, how embarrassing to be asked to leave, we were customers buying drinks intending to enjoy an afternoon of music.
We were on the way out, I said that i felt they were very rude and we had wanted to stay for the afternoon, she said, well stay then. But at that point on the way out the door, feeling totally humiliated, of course we weren't going to go back in.I pointed out that she had made us feel very uncomfortable and she said no i haven't.

1055,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,5,Terrible behaviour drunken,"I booked the 80’s weekend for myself and two grown up daughters. I understood it would be an adult weekend and that there would be drinking loud music dressing up etc which I thought could be a fun and upbeat weekend centred around live music.
Unfortunately the experience was not positive. We arrived on site at 5:30 ish bearing in mind you cannot access your accommodation till 4pm. There were already people so drunk they were unable to stand and vomiting in the toilets.
The first night the behaviour of people on site made us feel intimidated and unsafe. Large groups of drunk men making lewd comments whenever females passed, which if made in the street could result in arrests under sexual intimidation. Noise levels throughout the night were high, which we expected but At 4am the people in the accommodation above ours were kicking the doors banging slamming and vomiting.
Hours and hours of shouting banging and loud music throughout the day and night, I know I may sound like a boring old whatsit but if it was clear when booking then I wouldn’t have booked it.
The Saturday morning we went out to see if there were any of the other activities on offer eg the pottery painting etc only to be informed that they have to close these on the adult weekends as the “ men get in and smash the place up”
It felt unsafe, a lack of security / Butlins staff except at the bars. Check in offices etc closed so no one to talk to I had to ask in the restaurant how we could check out. They confirmed they had heard there were “some rude, difficult characters “in the area we were staying. i’m Not a prude or of a fragile nature. I feel there is not enough information given when booking as to the expectation you should have. They have a behaviour charter but it seems these do not apply on adult weekends.
It may be the case that our experience is not the norm but it was our experience. Unregulated groups of very drunk people spoiling the experience for others.
Again if you just want an 18-30’s experience and your 30-60 this may be just what you’re looking for ( and why not) but if you just want a fun weekend cantered around the music rather than just how much alcohol can be consumed then maybe not.

This is what they did to us...
- I booked this hotel as it came up top of the search with Pets Allowed filter in TripAdvisor. The website for booking was a different agent which was still ‘Pets Allowed” (to make my point).
- On arrival, we were greeted by a friendly receptionist and 2 other staff. They saw us with our dog and they even petted him etc. The receptionist even told us ‘Your room is one of the 3 dog-friendly rooms which is outside.” She even showed us a room where we can have our breakfast with our dog. So they knew we had a dog right from the beginning and gave us the room.
- Next day, at the check-out, a different woman was at the reception. She attacked us by rudely saying “Why didn’t you tell us you had a dog? Your room isn’t a dog-friendly room and it’ll cost us a lot of money for cleaning. You should have told us in advance about your dog like most people!”. We were absolutely stunned by the rudeness and the lack of customer service! She really REALLY made us furious.
- Why was it OUR fault when we were given that room? We had a dog with us right from the beginning, it’s not as if we smuggled the dog into the room! She wouldn’t back off! They charged extra £10 for the dog anyway (which we never complained about), so what was she trying to achieve by upsetting us like that? Unbelievable.
What kind of hotel is that? This woman has zero customer service, and because of that, we would never stay there again.

Food was the cheapest ingredients imaginable and the cost of even a basic sandwich or milkshake was through the roof. Staff were rude and unhelpful, when we complained about the quality all we were met with was hostility and refusal about our opinions of their food and all they offered was one sandwich off the bill. The chef should be ashamed and possibly not even in the industry at all. I am tempted to call the food standards agency and inform them of the atrocious quality of this place.

Even the napkins were damp and unusable for goodness sake. They claim never to have had complaints but google reviews is full of them and all of them have been given abusive responses by the owners of the cafe.

Do not go to this cafe ever! It is the worst food in a town with plenty of amazing options. If we had not had an insistant child with us we would have left as soon as the plates arrived.

To top off an already poor experience, when we attempted to pay the minimally reduced bill, we were then told there was no card payment available, so started walking to a cashpoint, but felt so nauseated by the time we got there we did not feel enclined to go back and pay, particually as the staff were verging on aggressive with a simple complaint and no apology. About half an hour later in the middle of the town, a car pulled up beside us and a man aproached, he started shouting at us that we had ran out on the bill...he would call the police....put us on facebook etc....all this while we had a child with us.

1066,The Town House,Food,Arundel, Restaurant,81,Upsetting experience.,"When we arrived at the Town House we felt it did not appear as bright and cheerfyul as it does in the photographs. We also found the tables too close together. We were allocated a table at the bar end, in front of a passageway with a view of the unisex toilet door.
My pate-de-foie terrine turned out to be just a small portion of pate which was okay but nothing special. My husband's scallops starter was nicely cooked. My main course of half a lobster was also nicely cooked. Sadly my husband's surf and turf was overcooked and cold. The waiter returned it to the kitchen and the same meal came back re-heated and even more overcooked. The glass of champagne was nice as was the half bottle of Chablis. The waiter was efficient and friendly.
We had made this booking using a voucher from 'Gourmet Vouchers. Our son had given this to us as a present for a special occasion. When we came to pay the bill - which had come to £32 more than the £100 voucher - the problems started. The restaurant had received only £50 from Gourmet Vouchers instead of the £100. This was entirely the fault of Gourmet Vouchers who telephoned my husband the following morning to apologise and to pay the restaurant the balance. We gave the restaurant the receipt for the payment to Gourmet Vouchers expecting them to deal with the problem. The manager told us we would have to deal with it and wanted us to pay another £50 then claim this back from Gournet Vouchers. As they had offered us no proof that they had received only £50, but we had provided them with proof that the voucher was for £100 we refused (leaving our contact details) but paid the rest of the bill in cash. Unfortunately this meant we had no cash to give the waiter the gratuity he deserved. The manager loudly argued that they did not have to take Gourmet Vouchers at all - they do their own vouchers - and behaved as though they had done us a big favour by taking it when they accepted our booking. As we left nobody opened the door for us nor wished us a 'good evening'.
The problems ruined our evening......we could forgive the 'not quite up to scratch' meal but as it was a special occasion for us we would have liked to leave the restaurant with a memory of a happy evening. Instead we left disappointed, embarrassed and rather upset.
We totally accept that the problems were the fault of Gourmet Vouchers but feel the resaturant could have handled the situation far better than they did.",2,3.0,2.0,Other,1

1076,Black Rabbit,Food,Arundel, Pub/Bar,29,Poorly run pub in a beautiful location - such a pity,"Set in a perfect Sussex location this pub has deteriorated so much - such complacency will eventually result in it's downfall. The beautiful location almost guarantees plenty of customers for now but they need to be treated with respect if they are to return.

We went for lunch on a busy summer's afternoon. We expected some wait but not so very long - I think they forgot us as once we reminded them we were still waiting, our starter did eventually appear.

The prawn and avocado cocktail was the poorest we've ever tasted. Obviously quickly thrown together- a chunk of avocado, one prawn, chopped vegetables in a vinegary sauce served with stale bread.

They then mixed up our steaks and as we had ordered them cooked differently with different sauces it was not practical to swap. The so called triple cooked chips were flat. The meal was so poor we couldn't face ordering a pudding. We just wanted to leave.

Our table was near the bar and all the time we were sitting there - and it was a long time - we couldn't hear ourselves speak as there was so much noise from the staff constantly loading the glasses into the dishwasher trays and throwing empty bottles into a container.

The girls behind the bar were not great - could do with being taught how to smile and be pleasant to customers as we noticed they were quite curt with some people who had a few queries re the menu.

Hopefully the owners will address these problems as it would be a pity to allow this well located pub to deteriorate any further.",2,3.0,2.0,British,1

1079,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,18,Disappointing half term break,"We booked a Gold apartment for 3 adults & 2 children February half term and were very disappointed: The accommodation smelt stale and was not clean when we moved in with a thick layer of dust on the dishwasher, rubbish down the back of the sofas, dirt, elastic bands and clips behind the bedroom drawers and stained bedroom curtains. We had only 1 dishwasher tablet left for the whole week and dirty wet towels we left on the floor were folded for us to reuse. We asked Guest Services what we might expect from daily housekeeping which we had paid for and were told only beds were made & bins emptied unless we requested otherwise. This is hardly daily housekeeping and we never saw the housekeeper to ask for more cleaning. Reception staff were apathetic to our complaints and so we bought some cleaning materials ourselves to get the job done. We could only access the cutlery drawer by opening the fridge door first (bizarre) and the fridge had door struts missing so the milk fell out every time it was opened! Entertainment and site facilities were generally good so it’s a great pity that the accommodation was such a let down. We filled in a satisfaction questionnaire and requested feedback but have received no response to date -again disappointing.

We got to our table and had kept saying to me that something wasn't right. I saw her handed over two 20 s and he showed me the change that was €7 we'd bought 2 drinks and some squid. Seemed rather overpriced so I checked the menu and he's been short changed by a massive £10. I went back to the bar to poinr this out and the barman wad totally non plussed like this was meaningless. I was very concerned. Yes he gave us our £10 but no apology and no reparation. It's a big mistake to make.
I think most people wouldn't even realise. Made me wonder if it's a common ploy there or if they are so used to cards the staff don't take much notice of notes and don't even look at the denomination.

Very worrying...check your change carefully if you go there.
We went in this pub because it's a Fullers and does food assuming they have standards.

We spent a long weekend there with our 3-yr old and by far this is one of the best hotels we’ve stayed in as a family. I travel all over the world for work so my expectations are high, however for family travel this ticks all the boxes.

There is a little TV area by reception showing CBeebies which is a great distraction on check-In.

The ‘ship’ theme is subtle yet consistent throughout the hotel which makes it fun for little ones.

Our room had a separate sleeping den for children (bliss!) and it’s own tv. Additional touches such as the nightlight and mini wardrobe were appreciated.

The bathroom is functional, do take own toiletries as you are not supplied with any more then the mini bottles which last a day.

The is a step & little toilet seat for children which is a nice touch.

Lots of storage, fridge, kettle etc. A separate sofa area and an activity wall which my daughter loved

Breakfast is very good, lots of choices and well managed by the restaurant team.

I’d happily stay here again, the hotel makes travel with children so much easier!

","I would love to tell you that we had a wonderful time, sitting in the garden admiring the view with sandwiches and a pint, but we didn't even get to order. Arrived at 12pm, most of the tables were empty. I waited a few minutes to be served at the bar, and asked if it would be ok to eat in the garden as I was confused why there was a sign saying that food was only served on the small terrace - why would we want to sit there, crowded with nasty metal tables, when there's a beautiful pub garden to enjoy? The lady behind the bar asked if I had made a reservation, to which I had replied that I hadn't. I was then told, very firmly, that those who had booked got priority. Fine, we only want sandwiches and I understand if the kitchen is busy, I said, thinking a packet of crisps would tide us over. How long is the wait? ""Even sandwiches take time,"" said the woman behind the bar like I was some kind of idiot, ""and there are FIVE tables to give their orders before you!"" What? They haven't even ordered? How is the kitchen busy? I don't think they had even arrived! It was the beginning of service, they weren't busy. I left with my family, without ordering anything. I've never been greeted in such an inhospitable manner when going to a pub, especially by the person who I assume is the landlady. She should have advised, politely and with a smile, that there would be a bit of a wait as they were busy, but asked what I wanted to drink - it's a pub, afterall! But, nope. Years spent waitressing has made me more sympathetic than most, but I was made to feel like my custom wasn't wanted. Thousands of pubs across the land manage lunchtime service, and of course on busy days there will probably be a wait, but there was no excuse for the treatment we received today. The staff were rude, service is a shambles - it was chaos behind the bar already, and all these unnecessary rules to help them cope with serving food goes to show how incompetent they are at running a pub.

Had breakfast there on first
And second morning. Chef took order and was super friendly and funny. Food was really good and freshly made.

On last evening decided to treat Friends to farewell dinner at the Inglenook and book the resturant for 4 adults and 2 children.

Meal was super disappointing. People next to us returned their meal (not sure why) and this should have been a warning! I had also seen a previous meal wending it’s way back to the kitchen.

We’re asked a few times if we were ready to order - finally made choices to be told half of them were not available! Now had to start again!

Ordered scallops starter. Small as expected- over cooked and cold! Also I think my husbands had been halved to make a serve and his were almost undetectable on the plate!

Mains arrive. Friends chicken supreme had less chicken per serve than the kids chicken nuggets! Also didn’t look that nice. The trio of pork was ok but not cracklings on the crackled one! Fish was incredibly small and probably should have been thrown back!

Very disappointed.

We were charged for an extra fish which we had actually cancelled when we saw the size on another table and changed for the supreme - which was equally small.

Final mornings breakfast - different staff member. Bit rude. Took order. Came
Out with plates held in a towel. Ot oh - well bacon had probably been kept warm for quite a while as almost impossible to cut and scrambled egg where previously had been freshly made was mushy and sat in a pool of water-microwaved? A pet hate of mine. Saving 3 minutes of time and the worst thing ever! Fork literally fell through it! YUK! Did not eat and left it all.

Despite the attempt to scuttle our plans, we decided to stay in place. Having put in our order for £100, we were then told we couldn't pay until all the reserved tables had been served.

1118,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,28,Summer holiday,"We are Butlins regulars having previously visited both minehead and Skegness as we have not been to Bognor before, we decided to give it a go. While they offer the full set of activities, the same as the other two, this site is our least favorite. It seems to be a lot smaller and less organized. Everything feels crammed in with a lack of areas around the accommodation where kids can play. If your kids want to kick a ball, you have too walk to the other side of the site. The site feels dirtier, lots of litter around and they don’t seem to keep up with maintenance as well with the accommodation feels old and falling into disrepair. The staff are really friendly and helpful but the site itself just feels old and dirty. The queues to get into places are long, upto 45 minutes to get into the swimming pool at times, and the food courts feels as though it is under staffed with having to wait for food to be bought out at the buffet and tables to be cleared. The staff look stressed and hassled, just not enough people to get the job done and the manager of the food court seems to be like a deer caught in the headlights.

As a family, we love Butlin’s and everything they have to offer to especially to keep kids busy and active, but when we come to book again for next year, it will definitely be either Skegness or Minehead. In our opinion, Skegness is by far the best, it is just a shame that it is the furthest away from us.

After a good walk we decided to stop for a coffee, then I spotted their special board - Hot Smoked Salmon and poached egg, my all time favourite, but could it compete with the best I’ve had so far down under in NZ. The quick answer is YES and by a long way. The salmon was just divine, the best I’ve had in a very long time, and that’s saying something because I always order it if it’s on the menu, as Tina Turner would say ‘simply the best’.
Hubby had the small GandG breakfast which he demolished with gusto, and to top it off the coffee was great, that in itself is something of an achievement in this part of the world, where it can be very hit and miss. At 0845 on a Sunday morning the place was buzzing, the staff were friendly and clearly enjoyed what they were doing.

The towel rails are hanging off the walls, to add to the list we can have wood lice all over the place inside and out, and locks on the doors that anyone can open with a long thin screwdriver, due to a purpose drilled hole next to the lock, see pictures.

1140,Toast,Food,Littlehampton, Café,4,Home Delivery - Extremely Disappointing !,"Since first going to Toast some 5 years ago, I have returned many, many times. I have also recommended to friends and family. This cafe always represented excellent value for money, great service and a warm welcome from staff. In fact I’ve written positive reviews in the past about this establishment, so today’s poor review is out of character for me, but justified.

At 11:37 this morning I placed a telephone order for Steak & Kidney Pudding, peas, mash and gravy. I have never ordered a home delivery before, but as I’m confined to home following major surgery this seemed a good idea. I was told the waiting time would be 45mins. After an hour had passed I called to find out where the order was. The woman said it had literally just left. Well it took the guy over 10 mins to deliver and I live literally one road away. Despite the fact the meal was 25 mins late there was no apology whatsoever.

Upon opening the container the first thing I noticed was a piece of white plastic - which looks like it came from one of those disposable knives. The meal was luke warm and pudding dried out like it had been cooked a while before and then left. It certainly wasn’t fresh or enjoyable.

So in summary, I wouldn’t recommend the delivery service. They simply can’t provide quality in a timely fashion. They’re late and sub-standard. Really a complete waste of money.

I think having read other reviews Toast is a victim of its own success. It was once very good indeed, but clearly standards have dropped and with so much competition around I would suggest they need to get back to where they were or loyal customers like myself will turn their back on Toast!",1,2.0,1.0,British,1

1167,Norfolk Arms,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,25,Disappointed,"Unfortunately it’s a lovely central hotel in the little town of Arundel that lacks finesse. The room was suitable for purpose in a back courtyard that was quite and unobtrusive. The most disappointing thing about our stay was the disgusting and virtually inedible breakfast. The cold buffet was mediocre (dried up cheese, ham with dried edges- looked a day old) in comparison to other hotels I’ve stayed in, I asked for a hot chocolate and was told no only tea or coffee, so asked for a flat white and was told no that wasn’t possible so decided on tea which was obviously what they wanted me to have! Anyway let me really tell you about the so say Norfolk Arms Full English breakfast. One shrivelled tomato that was so dried up it was like a rock, a hash brown so deep fried the grease was oozing out, a piece of bacon that was dried up and burnt, inedible scrambled egg that was more like dried shoe leather in a flat thin section, a cold piece of black pudding, cold beans and mushrooms that had the most dreadful flavour of as I’d imagine old socks.. the only good thing was the one tiny little sausage that was probably a local specialty.. I wish I’d just had sausages!! I can honestly say if this place had a decent chef you would not have to go elsewhere, but if you can avoid breakfast do as there are loads of other places in the town that you can eat at! Hotel staff were pleasant and polite.

1170,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,176,Toddlers week - really quite brilliant ,"Arrival was smooth, drove straight up in the car at 1pm. No queue. We were shown where to park. In silver accommodation so made our way to their desk, told access to our rooms was 4pm, then given wrist bands and keys (the electronic card types) then were free to use the facilities: soft play/indoor/outdoor fairground. I went off to the big Tesco’s (7 mins drive away and they do click and collect!) to get our weekly shop.

They have trolleys (like airport trolleys) to help unpack the cars.

Our accommodation was nice: clean, tidy, basic, but comfortable. We were very lucky with the weather, it was very warm but I’m guessing in the apartment would not be warm without the sun on it all day. In fact, ours felt a little damp in bed at night! They have little electric heaters in the room but I’m not sure how helpful they would be?

The kitchen is VERY basic. Kettle, microwave, oven. Take tea towels!!! Even if they give you one, it’s flimsy and won’t help with drying up a whole families washing up every day for 4 days! As we were in silver accommodation we had no towels so took our own (forgot a hand towel for the bathroom though 🙄) didn’t even think to take soap for the bathroom!

The wardrobes are TINY no way I could have hung much up even for the kids (even if I had remembered to bring hangers).

Dinner at the Diner - poor service and they weren’t even that busy! Expensive food and distinctly average. Very disappointing.

Our ‘keys’ regularly stopped working and we had to keep walking back to guest services - really annoying! Even had to have maintenance come out to check the door for us!

Swimming pool was epic. So much fun. Such a shame that it isn’t open for more hours really.

Fair ground rides are traditional and the kids (4 and 1) loved them. Basically no queues for anything so was perfect for them really.

Shows were great. Didn’t bother with fast track passes and still had decent seats for the shows. Queues for photos with characters were quite long (and ultimately the packages for the photos aren’t cheap), but u can take your own photos.

Beach is a very short walk away (just outside the back gate). It’s pebbles though.

Check out by 10am but you can stay and use the facilities again.

If anything says how good our week was, we booked to go back in August! Even though it was 3 times more expensive and its school holidays! We got a fairly decent discount for booking before we left!

Thirdly it’s an extra 10ft to walk ‘along a path’ which does not have rabbit holes as mentioned.

As we waited more than 40 minutes the room the amount of people complaining was astounding. Keys didn’t work, windows stuck, rooms too hot. One member of staff Esme was bossing the trainee around as she was trying to deal with us, instead of going around the reception desk herself. Also leaning over the desk, as she once again couldn’t be bothered to walk around it so I got an eyeful of her underwear as her dress was so short. Then proceeded to to hum to herself while everyone stood around annoyed.

The room was far from deluxe, basic and in need of some attention. The window wouldn’t stay open as the frame was rotten and there was a window pane missing which was covered up with plastic and cellotape. No air con so the room was scorching. They provided a huge extremely noisy fan which just blew warm air around as the window wouldn’t stay open. Just awful.

The lounge area had several lightbulbs out but was nice to sit in. The garden was lovely for eventing drinks.

The restaurant is our favourite part of this hotel. The food was lovely and the restaurant staff were well trained. Although service was a little slow but as it’s so lovely in the we didn’t mind waiting.

1217,Black Rabbit,Food,Arundel, Pub/Bar,2,Awful veggie sharer (nice location though),"My husband and I went to the Black Rabbit with our 6 month old baby on a Wednesday lunchtime. We ordered the veggie plate from the sharer menu and were very disappointed.
For a bit under £13 the platter offered an uninspiring selection of food that you could easily buy from tesco out of a packet. It included two boring falafels, a tablespoon of tzatziki, one piece of pita bread cut in half with a teaspoon of humous, a handful of cold cabbage and some cold cauliflower. The presentation was also very poor.
An embarrassment, and we were totally gutted as it's such a lovely pub with great views and drinks.
Although it's only a pub, they should be trying a bit harder to get these basics right.
We complained to the waitress who went and spoke with the chef and manager, but did not return to us for 20 mins. They did offer us another small portion of humous and pita bread, but too little too late.",1,3.0,0.0,British,1
1218,Sea View,Accommodation,Littlehampton,Hotel,41,Really very poor,"This is a rather belated review of our visit to the Sea View Pub/Hotel in East Preston on Easter Saturday, a few weeks ago. The review is in respect of the pub not the hotel itself – we live nearby so were just visiting for lunch and drinks.
It was our first visit and I have to say was disappointing in the extreme. We had in fact called in a few months previously after walking into East Preston and the barman had shown us the menu which included a fish platter (I can not remember the exact words or description).
However, when we arrived on Easter Saturday, we were told that with the exception of the plaice, they had no other fish at all (a fish platter was not on the menu but that is fair enough I guess as menus do change). We sat down with a drink and perused the menu and further disappointment arrived when we went to order.
As well as no “ordinary” fish they did not even have fish fingers for a sandwich and when I ordered ham was told “It’s still being cooked”.
We therefore settled on two x plaice and two x warm chicken and bacon salad.
It must be said that my wife and her brother who had the plaice described it as delicious (and that is the only thing that saved this from being a one star review). However the chicken and bacon salad were woefully lacking in either chicken or bacon!! Really poor.
With the exception of the barman (I think called Jamie) the rest of the people serving or hovering round the bar, who I think were the owners were all rather aloof and certainly not particularly welcoming.
To summarise, the two plaice meals were excellent, the service was not great and to have so many dishes unavailable at lunchtime on Easter Saturday is unforgivable (the pub was quiet at that stage so it was not because they had served lots before we arrived).
I can not comment on the hotel/bedrooms as we did not see them – I would add, however, that the stairway to the top of the building can be seen when accessing the toilets and the walls have peeling wallpaper and look distinctly unappealing.
As above, this really should be a one star review but the plaice meals meant I could not do that in all fairness.",2,2.0,2.0,0,1

Welcoming and helpful, just what you need when you arrive after a long day. We had renewed our wedding vows and were both tired. Given our keys and told about breakfast etc.
Found our room easily and were greeted by a congratulations card which was a lovely touch. Room was clean and had everything you could need. Tea, coffee, iron, hairdryer, TV and the most comfy bed in the world! Honestly best night sleep I've ever had. No hurry to get up but when we did, we went down to a lovely breakfast, very busy breakfast room but staff were friendly and helpful.
All In all a fab stay, would highly recommend.

The starter of meatballs in tomato sauce consisted of 3 small meatballs costing nearly £5. The 4 thin slices of aubergine were also nearly £5.

1227,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,16,In need of a make over ,"Having spent a lot of my childhood at the site I was excited to come back as an adult with our family. We booked a kids weekend with my sister, brother in law and child (just under 2), my parents and my parter (I am pregnant).

The accommodation was basic but clean. Couldn’t complain about location or facilities in the room apart from the uncomfortable beds. All members of the party woke up with back ache every morning. Housekeeping were really good, and made shapes out of the towels every day which was fun!

The food in the deck was good with a lot of variety. Only comment would be that the one night I had pasta from the pasta station the guy was too busy talking he forgot to actually cook the pasta and only realised once the sauce was ready so I had to wait double the time for the meal.

The resort itself is perfect for kids, however it is looking tired and in desperate need of refurb. Feels like there’s too much accommodation and not enough activity for the masses. All good and well spending money on new additions (the pool) but what about maintaining the facilities you already have?

Also barely saw any red coats during the trip. Isn’t that what Butlin’s is known for?!

Haven’t decided if I would go back.

1230,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,39,Avoid Ocean Hotel,"I’ve left a full review of the hotel on the hotels page, but let’s just say we were less then happy with the noisy doors, light switches, lifts, and neighbouring guests. It totally ruined our holiday from the first night, with noises into the early morning, all 5 of us were kept up and I personally did get a wink of sleep, I’m so disappointed with butlins ocean hotel, the design of the rooms, corridors, the actual doors and the sound proofing.

We have visited butlins every year for 4 years, the wave hotel is so much better for noise and layout. But this year also saw a huge influx of lower end clientele, unfortunately I would call them chavs, I understand that this isn’t butlins fault, but it’s a fact. These guests are load and anti social, we will be taking our money elsewhere from now on.

The plus side is every single member of staff on that resort is a credit to the organisation, so friendly, so up beat and just fantastic, shame about the room and guests.

The chips and onion rings were limp and cold. My husband had penne arrabiatta which came in such a small bowl like a kids portion.
To say the least the meals were horrible. I don't know if your chef has changed and your menu changed as well but after so many good meals there I doubt if we will go there again in a hurry to eat.

Went out that night with me my partner and 4 children I bought 6 drinks 4 soft drinks coke and 2 alcoholic drinks that came to £30 which I think is expensive plus a pizza on way back to Chalet got a pizza and 3 side and a drink £45. I wasn’t bothered about the cost at that point but thought it was expensive. We are inside when we hear shouting outside there is a women 4 young children 1 a baby there had been a fight and her husband had been arrested thought what a loverly place. So we wake up in the morning my partner suffers with really bad anxiety she realised that she forgot her tablets so on that on its own she became anxious she went off to try clear her head I then get a phone call saying we have an hour to get off the site because she was about to smoke in none smoking area she was walking to our car which was still on site but far away from anyone or anything the fag wasn’t even lit. So we waited for for someone to come then 5 big blokes all come up to remove my partner from site DISGUSTING people they had took her Wristband so she wouldn’t of been able to go in anywhere so this has all gone on I said so what about the people downstairs they used Physical violence the night before and you’re coming up here to remove my partner from our chalet I think you’re disgusting people. Then I said I can stay with my four children but my partner has to go who in their right mind is going to kick people off of their holiday camp on Christmas Eve there’s not much more to say but I am making formal complaints to managers and I’ll also be going to local papers to expose how disgusting the place actually is. If you look at all the crime around Bognor Regis Butlins result there is higher crime within the result stay clear disgusting place. AVOID AT ALL COST we spent less than 24 hours there they would not refund any money so they had nearly a £800 off me in less than 24 hours cost off accommodation £650
Spent £50 in there onsite shop
£120 on first night there
So £720 on that site without travel expenses included.
Also the plan was to spend Xmas at Butlins so was not prepared to be thrown off site on Xmas eve they also said that we will not be getting any refund. I think in total Butlins Bognor have cost me around £1000 for less than 24 hours.

1264,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,1,Not impressed!!!,"After hearing fabulous reviews of the Bognor Regis revamp we decided that we would take the plunge and go for it! My husband and myself work very hard for very low wages, we only get to holiday every few years so it's important for us as a family to choose the right holiday do that we can make the most of every moment! We arrived on site and had to wait for our silver room to be vacated by a staff member before we could get in, on entering there was good on the carpets in both bedrooms and an overwhelmingly bad smell of deep heat, we didn't want to start being negative and so we opened the windows and set off to explore! On returning the smell was just awful, but by then the oyster bay reception was shut; we phoned the emergency contact number for assistance - nothing was done, we then hunted down a member of staff on foot a few hours later- nothing done, we tried to make the best of it but my husband and myself couldn't sleep, I was physically sick as the smell was so bad and my husband was very angry - on holiday and we couldn't sleep because of the stink of deep heat! We soon realised the smell was coming from the mattress and pillows, they were absolutely covered, we were covered- my husband and myself absolutely stank too! For our third attempt the next day we went to the main reception in Butlins and asked for some help- thank God we were finally listened to and the kind lady contacted some one to change our mattress asap! Our room also had exposed wiring in our uplighters next to our bed, they were very low down - we had to keep warning our daughter to stay away from them as we were worried she would get an electric shock! We had pre-booked action passes - though the website fails to mention you need certain shoes for the go karts- which left me unable to ride, very upsetting! It also fails to mention that the bungee ropes also require you to wear short or trousers no skirts or dresses allowed- my little girl was devastated! Why not mention specifics on website so that you know what is required for specific activities?! Very disappointing and distressing! We loved the fair rides and spent alot of our time there, the arcades were also good. I was disappointed in the night entertainment- 'late night quiz? And disco?' Was this a joke? As a family we were excited to take part- expecting pens, paper and bundles of fun.... A couple of questions flashing up on a tiny t.v. with the answer following shortly is not a quiz nite....it's a let down, an awful excuse for entertainment! And the disco...? A couple or redcoats flailing about, crammed in between the stage and the chairs is not a disco-its depressing! We loved the sleeping beauty pantomime- amazing job, really fabulous and funtastic! And we loved the circus - really brilliant, made the whole experience bearable! We made some friends with some lovely members of centre stage staff Charley, Jaime-Lee and manager Steven- can't sing your praises enough, shining examples of wonderful people doing an amazing job!!! My daughter was refused to be able to join the line to get her magic kit signed by Steven Mulhern as she was a few seconds late - they gave 10 seconds for people to join line- we couldn't make it in time, no matter how many times my husband asked he was not allowed to join line with my daughter, he promised to sign each and every set purchased, my daughter was distraught and beside herself...long after Mulhern had left, way after the disco and quiz had finished along came Charley and her angels; Charley was so concerned about my daughter being upset and let down, she took time with Jaime-Lee to make her feel special- a million thank you's to you lovely lady's, you really bake a difference! Then Charley and Jaime-Lee got together with Manager Steven, who tracked down Mulhern and requested magic set to be signed as promised! My daughter was so happy - thankyou to you wonderful and caring staff- never stop being amazing, you make a difference in the world!!! Overall we were very disappointed with the whole fiasco, we worked hard to afford this holiday, and we couldn't even sleep whilst there! Would we come back? Unlikely!

I had scallops, beef wellington and 'down the rabbit hole'. Oh my, I'm salivating now writing this five days later. It was all cooked and presented like the place/chefs should have several michelin stars. My wife had the tuna loin and hake and felt similar to me, and having tasted them both I agree hers was good too. Especially the tuna.

The service was also fab, right from when we wandered in randomly to see if we could book a table for later to when we finished the last delicious wine.

1266,Church Farm,Accommodation,Littlehampton,AccomOther,0,"Terrible experience! dirty, old and wrong caravan, Haven guest relations not professional!","We have booked a Prestige Caravan at Haven Church Farm. arrived Friday after 6pm and we were shocked to see the state of the Caravan, terrible! all dirty, I wrote on the dirt of the windows to show to management. I will upload pictures as I also did send to management. There was a very polite receptionist, Victoria, who understood but said that manager wasn't there, I went to look for the manager 3 times, but I couldn't find him. We decided to avoid staying at the park and organised two trips, one for Saturday to Chichester and one for Sunday to Portsmouth (we end up spending a lot of money but at least we saved the break that supposedly was going to be a fantastic time in a Prestige caravan with decking.
When we left on Monday at 10am, I have spoken to the manager who apologised many times and said that this wasn't acceptable and asked me what I want, I said a voucher to use in the future so we will be able to rent a proper and decent Prestige Caravan for 3 nights, he said ""OK"", after apologising more times I asked him what are you going to give me: 3 nights in a Prestige Caravan or a voucher, he said a voucher, after 4 days I wrote to him and ask about my voucher, he sent an email with a £50 voucher, a complete liar, dishonest person, his name was Sam, the manager.
I have complaint to Guest Relations, no help, very useless and unprofessional, they rise up the refund to £100 then after many more emails they rise to £150 as they said they accept the ""problem with cleaning"" this is not a case for cleaning, first is a case of cheating a customer, allocating a Caravan that not even is acceptable for a standard level. £150 is not acceptable for making us waste our time and push us to make different plans when we travelled with 3 children for more than 4 hours in the car, it was impossible to abandon the break and we use it only for sleeping as it was difficult to move to a different resort as we have a child with special needs who is very difficult to understand transitions, we have explained everything to customer services, guest relations but they don't understand, we are not asking for a free break but to be offered the high amount we paid so we can organise another break in the future and the only amount they want to reimburse if £150, this is less than the third of the amount paid.
Guest Relations are not competent, and I have asked for a general manager to look into this situation, but they just don't give a flying flamingo about this.
Very poor service and the manager Sam a very dishonest person, now is laying he did not offer what he did.
I will never come back to that bad managed holiday park and most likely not using Haven anymore as the guest relations team are so useless, they don't even read my email properly and keep answering their way. terrible experience, please have a look at the pictures of an ""Prestige Caravan""

We did not climb to the top of the keep, but did enjoy having a go at archery with a long bow. There were plenty of places for people to picnic. Although very busy it never felt too crowded. The gardens with the tulip display were spectacular. We also had a very tasty venison burger from one of the event catering stalls and a nice pint of bitter.

Firstly we were greeted by a very rude man who seemed to see us as an inconvenience (I understand that there is a cafe attached but I feel that you shouldn’t offer take away if you can’t handle it) the poor cashier was lovely but seemed very uncomfortable and aware of the weird atmosphere, we then asked if we could have some smaller/ portions of chips which he seemed confused about and then simply said “no, we can’t halve portions”, weird , its chips, it’s not like we were asking for half of a of fried egg.
Then the chips...... wowee...why on earth would you waste a location like that by chucking some oven chips in oil and hoping for the best. They were rubbery bits of food formerly known as potato, no authenticity at all.

The room was large enough and was clean, the carpet could do with being renewed and had an iron mark by the end of the bed. There was only 2 tiny bars of soap, no shampoo / conditioner etc. There was instant coffee and tea but no bottled water.

The breakfast was an experience, we arrived to an almost empty dining area and the waitress wanted to seat us by a window in direct sunlight and almost on top of a couple of gentlemen on the table next to us, the tables were so close. The waitress said she would have to ask her manager to change our table . . . The dining area was empty???

The manager appeared and said they had a coach party and they had allocated tables. OK, but we are paying guest too! She reluctantly moved us to another table and we ordered breakfast. Breakfast arrived, the toast was cold and brittle (been made a while) and I had a long hair in my baked beans, I did not eat the breakfast and asked the waitress to take it away, I was offered a replacement, but declined.

We left for a day out and on our return our key card did not work, but it was ok because our room was OPEN!!! This was the last straw, out all day with our belongings unsecured, all my work files, personal documentation!

The 2 sofas and the single beds were extremely uncomfortable, very hard mattresses and the sofas were the worst I have ever sat upon. The so called entertainment was boring and chiefly aimed at children. The later evening shows were just a repeat of the same boring 'pretend' singers that have been there for goodness how long. I only saw 1 redcoat during my holiday and she didn't bother to speak or smile at any of the guests. I have been holidaying in Butlins for many years, but this could be the last time. The new pool has no viewing area and there is no real place to actually swim. It is also very expensive in the shops, you can buy the same goods in Bognor town centre at more than half the price of Butlins. The food in the restaurants is fairly good, but is cold by the time you get to your table! It is very expensive for not a lot now. Shame on you Butlins, Billy Butlin must be turning in his grave, he always said when you paid for your holiday there was nothing else to pay extra for. Now everything is extra. Shame really.

1306,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,13,Good day but not as described,"Visited for the day with our little girl (9 months) and although we ended up having a nice day that was more because we made the most of it, rather than because of the site and facilities. Feel like the website is incredibly misleading, and wouldn't recommend it for those with very young children.
Firstly with the mini fairground, swimming and entertainment we felt like we were given an impression that there would be plenty for us to do with our daughter. However everything had height restrictions on and we were not able to accompany her on the rides either. That meant the only thing she could really go on were the paid for rides in the arcade. Not sure what the point is of a mini fairground if those who can't ride the main fairground rides are excluded!
We'd planned on the swimming being a big part of our day, and having read the website we had high expectations. The changing village 'designed with mumsnet' featured several rave reviews so we were looking forward to using them. However to be blunt they are like any other changing rooms I've ever visited, just with a seat belted chair for children in each changing cubicle. The underfloor heating promises 'no more soggy socks' but must have been off on the day we visited as there was a good few centimetres of standing water everywhere - including the toilets! It was a horrible experience really, we wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.
We also had a terrible experience in the pub-style restaurant on site, with slow service, poor prices and terrible value, limited availability from the menu, staff who didn't listen to requests and low quality food.
Both the meals my wife and I wanted were unavailable, and there was no coke zero. We also asked for no ice in the cokes and they were packed full. Our wait for food was long despite the pub being quiet and when it arrived the portion sizes were terrible for £6/7, note the 'side salad', and my chicken & bacon bbq wrap tasted awful.
The bar/bowling area was great and we enjoyed that, although it was bizarre we found the best changing facilities here.
Overall perhaps we were naive to take our little one at such a young age, but we booked based on the info online and feel mislead. Wouldn't recommend for very young families.

Both dogs were tentative but then 2 young brothers joined me in the water and befriended the dogs and asked intelligent questions and helped reassure the dogs who adore children. I struggled with the pebbly beach though, I wouldn't presume to say that I am a Princess but I felt that each pebble was like the pea in the Princess and the Pea story and ooch ouch they hurt, especially when the dogs were now reassured and delighted with themselves and decided to run like lunatics across the beach and back and excitedly run up to all children at full pelt, stop, invite to play and then shake excess salty sea water along with kicked up sand at them.

Why am I telling you this, my dogs can't be the only excited dogs at this beach, so be warned in case I am there again, only with one dog at a time though!!

I loved the beach though, there are pockets of sand where you can park your bum. The car park closes at 8pm I think and the parking was on grass which was great, although no shade for the dogs but there was a dog friendly car park too.

We were kept waiting to order our meals, and had to go looking for someone to take our order. Prices are quite high ( we were charged £1.20 for soda water and lime - usually about 40p everywhere else). The food, when it arrived, looked ok, but not great. The roast beef was tough, in fact so much was over cooked - the veg was often soggy, whereas the Yorkshire pud was rock hard. The veggie meal included a meat sausage wrapped in bacon. The menu said that extra gravy, potatoes and Yorkshire’s were free with Sunday roast, but we were charged extra for gravy, and the waitress wouldn’t take it off the bill until we pointed to it printed on the menu. Whilst the waitress tried hard, it was clear that the restaurant was running on minimum staff, who seemed young and inexperienced.

Outside the restaurant, the back garden area was really scruffy and strewn with litter. The tables weren’t cleared throughout our entire stay.

We’d booked and arrived on time, were shown to our table in a very busy Restaurant and sat watching for quite some time before we had to ask for someone to take our order.
This gave us the opportunity to watch a procession of waiters walking up and down the restaurant, without appearing to notice what was going on.
We were being served by a waiter who seemed to have a wish that he was a million miles away from the restaurant, to say he was surly, rude and couldn’t really care less what was happening to us would be an understatement, he then proceeded to ask the order taker to accept our food order.
A starter devoured, a Prawn Puri, as food goes it scored around 3 out of 10, boring and heat with no spice zing to it. Having used some cutlery a new fork came bouncing across the table with all the grace of a Barnes Wallis bouncing bomb, thrown instead of placed. New plates were treated similarly with no grace at all.
The food, served reasonable quickly considering they were so busy, was quite good, not spectacular, but regular ‘Indian Food’, in good sized portions and reasonably priced.
Behind us continued the melee of people, it was bit like eating in a train station. Trying to pay, after finishing what we wanted to eat, was again moments of delights and leaving our utensils at the finishing positions on our plates, we were passed by at least 6 waiters who looked at our plates and just walked on by, sometimes walking to the other end of the Restaurant and walking back again.
You would have thought the fun would stop there, but they had one last treat for us, the bill was brought, with hot Towels and 2 After Eight mints between 3 people.
So, thank you Magma for such a fun ‘Fawlty Towers’ evening.
Will we be back?
Maybe when Customer satisfaction comes higher on your list, than cramming them in and some of, not all, your waiters realise we are customers.

We looked at the menu and liked the look of the food offered. As it was a lovely evening we decided to walk along the river to the pub rather than the road.
Having taken 50 mins to walk along the river, we arrived at 20.45 A slightly longer walk than we thought it would take us.
We ordered a bottle of wine and asked for the food menu only to be told the kitchen unfortunately had taken its last order at 20.30 something I had missed on the website.

The manager was very apologetic, not really sure why as it was our mistake not his. The reason we had come to Arundel was for a belated birthday celebration for my other half.
He offered the bottle of wine at a significantly reduced cost to us and also gave us some vouchers to use for next time after he found out the reason for our stay.
Well and about anything we expected for a issue that was ours not his. It’s a shame we weren’t able to eat there that night as the food coming out looked and smelled amazing.

1323,Premier Inn Arundel,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,70,Shocking,"There is probably nothing wrong with the other rooms in this Premier Inn, however I will never forget my night of torture in room 111.
Upon opening the door the physical barrier of heat struck me like a Mike Tyson blow.
The curtains had been pulled, and the window had unfortunately been left open by whoever cleaned the room. This allowed it to become superheated, and the pedestal fan that had been left running at full pelt was vainly struggling to circulate the air. This produced the same effect of the a fan oven turned up to 10.
So I popped out after opening the window to the full 3 inches allowed by the security wires, to try cool the room.
Alas it was a vain hope, as the room took on the semblance of a Tennessee Prison sweatbox, and my night was reduced to a couple of hours of rolling from one puddle to another!

The welcoming booklet explains how the air conditioning system works, in a different hotel, with a different system. The control panel on the wall stated that this system could not cool the room.

1326,Whittingtons Band Stand,Food,Bognor, Fast Food/Takeaway,14,Very poor fish and chips right next to the sea,"We were out for the day and as near to the beach, we thought we would pop to the seafront to get some authentic fish and chips and where better to get them than right on the beach? Well, so we thought.

The kiosk is situated just a matter of feet from the pebbles of the beach with sturdy solid benches literally inches from them so we thought we'd go here as felt like a perfect location. We ordered 'Crispy cod and chips'. Some time later after serving lots of people who had ordered after us but wanted just chips, ours was ready.

As soon as I opened the box my heart sank. It was immediately obvious that it wasn't proper fish and chips. The fish was a pre-made frozen portion, which looked very much like the stuff you get from supermarkets that specialise in frozen foods. You dont need to work in fish and chips to see it (and I have). It was so clear that this was not a fresh piece of fish, drenched in batter and fried there and then. It had been deep fried for sure - it was so drenched in oil that it was glistening in the sun. It was as tasteless as a piece of frozen portion which would expect to be. I should have been suspicious by the 'Crispy Cod and chips' on the menu as it didnt say 'fresh cod and chips' or locally caught etc.

Then there were the chips. They were not authentic chips that you would expect to get from a chippy. They were closer to french fries but fatter, and very uniform in shape more akin to something you would get in a school canteen.

A final minor point - they didn't have enough bottles of sauce, vingear etc out so they were virtually empty and I watched a number of people squirt out mostly air to small amusement as it sounded like blowing raspberries, but meant no sauce.

It was very disappointing. Easily the worst fish and chips that I have paid for, and it really shouldn't be that sort of food being right by the beach in a very British seaside town.

On arrival we found a pleasant if a little tired, village pub. Staff were friendly.

We were shown to our room and found it was extremely basic and had a shared bathroom. We thought we'd booked ensuite (but that could have been our error so would be unfair to apportion blame). We asked about changing rooms and we're told that no one else was booked in to share the bathroom - possibly reluctant to change us because it would mean preparing another room (I don't know). We were too tired to push it so we agreed but this did mean that our route to the loo and shower was across the stairs from the bar and dining room.

The food and drinks were good. Usual pub menu and range but was hot and nicely presented.

On retiring for the night, the pub was closed and dark around 10.30/11 so our moonlight flits to the loo weren't as stressful as anticipated.

The shower sounded like it was powered by a combine harvester and the shower screen door was propped up outside the bathroom having been replaced by a shower curtain. The shower holder was broken so we couldn't change the angle of the water so the floor and bathmat were cold and soggy by the time we'd showered.

I can't comment on the standard of the other rooms but our room most certainly wasn't 4 star and I'd be reluctant to return. I do have to acknowledge the age of the building and that updating it would be tricky, but keeping what they do have, in better order would make a nicer stay

1340,"The Windmill, Harvester",Food,Littlehampton, Pub/Bar,5,Absolute Shocker wish I’d read the reviews,"Waited 7 mins to be greeted. I don’t time these things but I was looking at the time on my phone when we got in there. Think about that. 7 minutes standing there hoping someone would at least give us a nod, let alone approach us with an 82yr old and 2 small overheating thirsty girls. Totally unacceptable and I should have left then but the girls were hungry and it was my 82yr old mums birthday. What a treat she got, not.

When the server finally came over she sternly asked if we’d booked (as though it was unlikely we’d get a place)? It was 5:45pm, hello.

The restaurant was half empty by the way so id dread to think what it’s like when it’s busy. Unless you have the patience of a saint id avoid this place. I’ve come here on and off for years when invited by others and although the food has improved, it’s more expensive than it used to be but there’s always a problem either with hygiene, sticky tables, rude staff (not today though, they just didn’t get near us), poor supply to the salad bar, etc.

30 mins after being seated we were given no salad bowls but more importantly we were parched but STILL NO drinks on the hottest day of the year, so no rehydrating my 4 and 6 yr old in sweltering heat. 30 minutes after ordering with not even the jug of water that we ordered is unacceptable in that heat. When I finally had enough I wandered up and got my own jug at the bar. Intriguingly it had a big bite mark chunk out the side of the skanky worn out water jug. It should have been in the bin. Oh and they don’t have any ice on the hottest day in summer!!! Basil Faulty runs this place, surely?

No tomatoes or cucumbers in the salad bar just a watery mess where they once lived. Loads of sauces to choose from but it was a lucky dip as none were labelled running the risk of giving your child chilli sauce instead of ketchup or relish.

We ate the cut-down salad off little side plates as nobody gave us bowls so we improvised with what was there. My mum only had salad bar as she’s elderly so her whole meal was on a tiny side plate! Disgraceful.

After being left to fend for ourselves I cleared the finished salad plates myself in the end and put them on the tray I got from the bar when I went to serve myself and my family that jug of water.

As a side note I took my little one to the men’s bathroom. She’s kicked off her sandals under the table in the heat but I hadn’t realised. She then walked into the toilet and walked in urine leaking from the urinals. They had put out of a sign to say wet floor but it was puddles of wee all over the bathroom everywhere so my little princess had walked through lots of pee to get from the cubicle to the sinks, the poor little mite. It should have been mopped up or locked up.

Nobody asked how the food was, we weren’t offered any more drinks (not that they arrive anyway) despite it being sweltering. We didn’t get spoken to by anyone in that whole time since ordering food and due to the continued lack of staff I eventually had to go up and stand at the tills and interrupt a member of staff in order to actually pay the bill and get the hell out of there.

I noticed on the wall above the till it said something like “remember, no more bad reviews like the one from D.L” with a big arrow pointing towards it or something similar so it’s not as if they don’t know they need to buck up their ideas. To be fair the 2 people I encountered at the till were kind and apologetic. I wasn’t one of their tables but you could see they were frustrated and working under pressure in what seemed like a sinking ship so I did have sympathy for them. Very poorly managed though I’m afraid and lots of customers looked disgruntled. More staff and someone in maintenance to sort the bathroom, ice machine, I’ve cream machine is what’s needed.

The simple food took 45 minutes to arrive which is way too long in a half empty restaurant. Other restaurants set your expectations if there’s a long wait over 20 mins.
The food itself was ok when it arrived but I just wanted to get out of there by that point. I’d have to be desperate to go back there

1341,Robin Hood,Food,Bognor, Pub/Bar,4,Terrible Service,"We stayed at the attached Premier Inn, having been in the area attending a 21st birthday lunch, so the Robin Hood was the obvious choice for a light bite that evening.

We opted to have just sharer starters and dessert, but were there for two hours because the service was so slow - you would guess because it was a Saturday evening and therefore busy, but it was not and there were lots of empty tables (which surprised us because we'd booked a table online several days before and could only get 1815 or 2000, so had assumed everything else in between was already reserved).

However, the worst part for us was when we ordered a 0% Kopparberg cider for our 17 year old daughter mid-way through our visit. This was brought over by someone other than the waitress we'd placed the order with, and he immediately asked our daughter for ID. We questioned him and stated that it was a NO-Alcohol drink, assuming he hadn't realised that it wasn't a 'normal cider'; but he insisted on knowing their age stating that it still came under the same alcohol regulations - to which we advised him she was 17. He then said 'that's fine because even it was alcoholic there is no problem, as they could still be bought an alcoholic drink by an adult when eating in a restaurant' - by which time we really couldn't see the point in the whole conversation.....!!

Unfortunately, the episode had upset both our children, and our daughter left the restaurant after the starter not wanting to stay any longer and have a dessert. Our 12 year old son was absolutely stunned by the questioning, and kept repeating 'I don't understand, it was NO-Alcohol'.

We had no issue with the food served, but the service was appallingly slow - and the unnecessary questioning over what was essentially a mixed fruit squash left us all dumbfounded.

(For clarification, we looked into the ID issue after we left, and law only states that under 18's cannot buy or be served alcohol that has a content of 0.5% or more - this 'cider' was 0%, zero, nothing, null, nil - with the exception of a licenced premises serving food when a 16 or 17 year can then be bought an alcoholic beverage by an adult).

The only saving grace really was that we had a Tesco Clubcard voucher to cover the cost of the food, otherwise we would probably have left long before any of it was even served.

I booked a birthday table online specifically stating it was a birthday (they have a separate page for special occasions), and then called up the restaurant to ensure they understand it’s for a birthday and arrange decorations as promised on the site.

We turned up on Friday, 21st June, and told them we were there for the birthday table. The lady helping us found the booking, asked us who the birthday table was for, and then we handed over the cake to her.

We noticed there were no decorations or anything on the table - just a plain table with your usual menus. We were a bit surprised as we always got decorations and our server at least wishing my son a good birthday at Papa John’s. At least we have a cake, we thought.

Dinner goes fine and service was okay. We waited for about 30 mins for the cake, and finally, fed up, we asked for our cheque. The lady brings the cheque, we pay and she thanks us for visiting.

Confused, we ask her about the cake. She apologises, goes back into the kitchen and comes back with the cake - still in the box and in the plastic bag and leaves it on our table and walks away (with an apology though). It was a surprise, but she just puts the box in front of my son.

Thanks, Pizza Hut, for ruining my son’s birthday. Taught us to stick with Papa John’s - which we ended up doing - we re-did the birthday there the next night. Shame on you Pizza Hut - your brand will not be seeing us visiting again.

Closing this place down would only improve the reputation of the brand name - I hope they do!

We came pretty early (just after 5pm) and it wasn’t busy at all, only a handful of other tables busy.

The waiter wasn’t friendly at all, we didn’t even get a smile.

The waitress struggled to remember which drink was which, there was only 5 drinks, 2 diet cokes, 1 normal. The normal had a lemon, the diet had lime but she somehow couldn’t figure out which 2 were the same?! ‍♀️

The starters came relatively quick but the tato tots were really salty which wasn’t nice at all.

After 1h 10 since arriving at the restaurant, we then complained our meals hadn’t arrived. 4 out of 5 of them then arrived a minute later. The chips were cold on mine, my friend’s chicken was so over cooked she couldn’t even cut it and another’s bacon was also over cooked.

We complained and asked where the last meal was. Didn’t get much of a sorry, it felt like they were annoyed we complained.

The missing meal arrived 10 mins later, it was only nachos so you’d think you couldn’t go wrong, but there was virtually no cheese on it.

They then brought some more chips for me and another chicken meal, but at this point I’d finished my burger and didn’t really want the chips.

We would have had desserts but at this point had been in there so long and were so unimpressed we didn’t see the point in waiting to see how they could mess up that!

We got the bill (reduced thankfully, although should really have been free after all that), paid some in cash and asked to pay the remaining £18 on card, split half each. This ended up being £8 on the first card and £10 on the second. How is it hard to half £18?!

Great views of the river, and the ancient bridge and also the south downs national park in the background. Really please we decided to go in, sitting in the sunshine by the sparkling river - delightful. We tried the loos, as you do ... freshly cleaned for the day and sparkling.

The owner must be particularly enlightened because not only are dogs welcome but even better there is a strict no smoking and vaping ban. Lets face it, 99% of people visiting are going to be walking on the Downs or along the river bank, they are not the sort of people who want to breathe in other people's second hand carcinogenic cigarette smoke or, worse, some sort of synthetic sickly sweet vape mixture.

1397,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,3,Butlins discrimination,"Butlins discrimination.
Any single people planning to book a break at Butlins, don't bother. Same sex couples need to read the terms & conditions too.
On Wednesday 17th July I booked a 4 night break for Monday 22nd July to Friday 26th July.
I booked a single room for a single person and then an extra payment for breakfast and dinner for 1 person each day. Butlins accepted my booking, took my payment and sent me a confirmation email.
Today, Friday 19th July, I recieved an email saying that my booking had been flagged because I am a single person going on my own. I thought the email might have been a scam so I rang the number on my original confirmation email to be told that, as a single person, I can only go on a live music weekend to a Butlins resort and that it's in their terms & conditions. I was also told that I would have to wait a further 2 or 3 days before I got my money back, so roughly by Sunday 21st July. Seeing as I've planned a break commencing from Monday 22nd July this leaves hardly any time to book another break using my original holiday fund.
During the phone call I asked if it was ok for a married couple with no children to go on a Butlins break and was told that it was ok for married couples of opposite sex but same sex couples would need to prove they are married. On that basis it would be interesting to know if an unmarried, opposite sex couple, would have any booking problems.
The fact that it's in their terms and conditions doesn't change the fact that it's discrimination and, let's face it, how many single people would read the terms & conditions to find out if they had to be accompanied by a child.
Conclusion: If you are single or gay then Butlins don't think you're safe to be around children.

When it came to paying the bill, a senior member of staff deleted my regular cod off the bill as a gesture. He said the cod is sold by weight.

The floors in the changing room were filthy with mud , clumps of hair and god knows what else. Around the resort wasn’t enough for toddlers. My child was just shy in heigh of almost every ride etc so was really disappointed in that. Only thing my child could to was play in the park or indoor soft play but as I’ve said before it’s just to busy. Not enough for adults to do either.

The actual pool and rides is very nice, bit of a wait for some of the slides but what can you expect on a bank holiday weekend. What I did take a big exception to was the disgusting state of the changing rooms. There was blood smeared across the walls together with god only knows what else. The floor was filthy strewn with rubbish and hair. Bultins really need to get their act together and get cleaners cleaning more regularly.
Outside the fair rides are looking a little dated and one several were not working.
Food and drinks venues very expensive and not great quality.

Overall a big disappointment, not sure if we will return for a 7th year.

1460,Swan Hotel,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,50,"Not worth the money for an ""indulgence room""","Didn't feel ""indugent"" at all! The walls and paint were scuffed. The double bed was two single divans pulled together so you slipped down the middle of the two of them. No bath, only a bare windowless shower room with lino on the floor. It is stated that not all rooms have a bath but the bathroom itself was tatty, with a cracked sink and toilet lid. Decor was more plain than stripped back. The furniture was stained with other people drinks. No minibar or fridge.

Positives - The room was clean. The bed was comfy if you didn't go close to the middle! A complimentary bottle of Proseco as it was our anniversary. The pub is excellent and the staff and breakfast both faultless. The fault does not lie with the staff or their hospitality. Fresh milk for tea in the room.

It was a large and okay b&b type room but lacked a level of polish that I would expect at this price. I felt mis-sold by Fullers, the room I got is only featured in one of their photographs (and only on the separate booking companies website) whilst the rest of their rooms look far more ""indulgent!""

All four of us who had left literally the whole bowl and yet not once were we asked if there was a problem or how our meal was.
The 5th person who had ordered it, got forgotten and he ended up with a carbonara to eat after we had all stopped trying to eat ours. His though,was even worse than ours. It was so far from al dente it was basically uncooked and other than the taste of flour there was no flavouring at all.

Staff were all very pleasant and the breakfast was good - but for £179, definitely not the stylish and pretty standard experience I have previously experienced with the Hilton chain.

We were greeted by Sindy in the gift shop who shared the Denmans history and gave us some information to read on our way around. It was clear from this moment that we were about to experience something very special! The gardens are just lovely and the design so thoughtful with shape, heights, textures and colours creating such a wonderful layering effect. And lots of benches to sit and admire the views. I was pleasantly surprised about how much my children enjoyed the visit. A win win as far as I am concerned! It was also wonderful to know that by visiting we are supporting a charity whose purpose is to maintain the gardens for future generations to enjoy. The staff are delightful and so passionate about the gardens that I found the visit not just inspiring but uplifting. We will definitely return to Denmans very soon.

Luckily it was past lunchtime so we got a table with ease. The waitress handed us all menu's and left us for few minutes, which was the normal thing to do. She came back and took our drinks order. The drinks took 10 minutes to arrive. Then she left us to decide on our meals. Came back five minutes later. Took our order. And we waited. And we waited. Finished our drinks. The restaurant was half empty at this point. So it wasn't because there was a rush on. After half hour my husband got up and asked where our food was and how much longer. We were first told 20 minutes longer. We said ok we're leaving, we'll pay for the drinks but we'll leave it there. Then they said, no wait, where are you sitting? Oh yeah yours is out next, so five minutes not 20. It actually was 10. When it arrived, my burger that was described as mildly spiced was hot spice, and cold in temperature. So we complained and they offered to make another. My granddaughter took a bite of hers, and again it was cold and pink in the middle. The order of chicken wings which again was described as mildly spiced, were hot spiced. So after all the waiting, cold food, half cooked burger, and spicey food we said enough was enough and we left. We said again we would pay for the drinks, but the restaurant said the drinks were free after all the upset. We ended up at the Moathouse cafe across the road.

The tractor ride is lovely and the set up is great for getting close to the lambs, chicks and ducklings. It wasnt too busy so my daughter got lots of turns to hold the chicks. We have been here before and always been impressed. The volunteers are very good however left a little dissapointed by one this year, a young chap in the lambing section handing out the lambs to those who wanted to hold them. My daughter was waiting to be passed a lamb and as he got one and came over he was spoken to by another member of the public. He stood there holding the lamb he was about to put on my daughters lap and continued his conversation first leaving us waiting......all well and good had the conversation not been about how they ""Have a bolt put to the head"" obviousldy describing how they end up being killed and what is involved. I appreciate this is sadly the reality of what happens to some of the lambs but felt it a really unneccesarty conversation to have in front of children and whilst holding the lamb in his arms as we waited for him to finish describing a lambs final moments. Wasnt impressed by tis and luckily i do not think my daughter heard the conversation otherwise that couild have potentially been quite upsetting.

My daughter always loves these breaks and being four years old this break should of been perfect for her. But here is a lost of how things have changed this year:

* Hardly anything open and what is open they are shutting before they are supposed to

* Advertised fair ground but they have removed a few rides for Toddlers height so were two rides she could actually go on

* Dont go midweek you wont get to book breakfast with the characters or any extras because people who go there at the beginning of the week have booked it all up and they dont save any spaces for mid week guests

* stayed in shoreline hotel, breakfast was cold evry morning

* New pool is great when you get to go in it, they shut it earlier than advertised and completely closed on one of the days of our stay.

* They now repeat the same shows throughout the week rather than performing different ones so if you stay for a full week be prepared to no each of the few shows available word for word

I spoke to Lyn Barlett from Butlins customer service and her response word for word was the following:

Whilst we endeavour to have all available and open as advertised, Butlins do reserve the right to make changes without prior notice across the resort.
Turning to your comments regarding the bookable activities. Unfortunately, booking these online isn't currently an available option. I appreciate that guests booking these on the day of arrival may have put you at a disadvantage.

Even after my feedback Butlins has determined that I am not entitled to any of my £250.00 back for a two night stay with breakfast. Even though we could not do the activities we wanted, the breakfast was cold and most things were shut or shut early.

My advice would be to stay away and that's coming from a loyal customer who has previously enjoyed their stay. They do not offer the same standard of service of activities anymore.

They are such a reasonable price and both of my children have loved them. My main issue is with the general care of the place. It just seems that so much money has been spent on a glitzy reception and cafe whilst the poolside and changing rooms are frankly disgusting. The reception staff also barely acknowledge you and are often quite rude which is very off putting. I've been a regular visitor for nearly 9 years and in that time the same family cubicles/baby changing facilities are broken and it seems have never been repaired. Half the showers never work in the ladies and if they do the water is always freezing. The toilets are also so dirty that my son nearly had an accident on the way home from his lesson as that was preferable to him using the facilities available. Come on Arun. The fundamentals are there, the lessons are amazing. Money just desperately needs to be spent on cleanliness and basic repairs.",2,1.0,0.0,0,1
1504,Parpadelle,Food,Arundel, Restaurant,33,Lovely looking restaurant - shame about the food,"I ate here with my 3 year son after looking for a casual Italian restaurant. Typically you can't go wrong with italian food for a little one and Parpadelle looked cosy yet casual from the outside. It turns out the menu downstairs is different from upstairs (I didn't realise there was an upstairs until later in the meal). I ordered a kids margherita pizza and moule frites

The kids pizza came up. The base was flavourless and undercooked and it was smothered in cheese and covered with herbs and rocket salad. Fine for an adult. Not fine for a fussy 3 year old.

The mussels were worse. I ordered it with chips but was offered bread as there was plenty of sauce. I said yes to this but then turned out it was bread OR chips so never received the chips. It didn't matter in any case as the mussels hadn't been washed and I after 4-5 mouthfuls of grit and sand I gave up and sent it back and picked at the equally inedible pizza.

On the upside the service was friendly. The waitress did apologise and said she would tell the chef / not charge for the mussels which was fine. But in the end I just left hungry and would have preferred to pay for food I could eat.",2,2.0,2.0,Italian/Pizza,1
1505,Travelodge Fontwell,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,0,No idea I'd be stopping in a cresh.,"First of all the motel is clean ish! Very very dated compared to the other over the road.
The staff on reception are helpful and polite so absolutely no problem there.
I personally am booked in here through my work I have little choice where I stay when you work for a very large corporate who do all your bookings for you .
This is my second week of staying in this motel and between 9 am and 12pm the place has become a cresh, the cleaners have obviously brought there children with them to work as its school holidays and yes child care costs a fortune but on the same foot staying here also does.
My job involves working into the small hours and therefore being in bed all day ( or trying to be )
All around the corridors are signs saying please keep quiet people may be sleeping and I Personally hang the sign on the door to say I'm sleeping.
Now I've done this for years and I sleep with earplugs in but sadly here I'm plagued by children playing in the corridors outside my room it's a big place and I've looked outside to have a word with the cleaners but they are not even on this level the kids are just running around being kids because they don't know better.
Just be warned if your thinking of staying here .

I understand mistakes happen, but to be told we were wrong and argued with was not acceptable. We had a break from this restaurant for a few years as we had the same experience then.

Luckily we had spoken to the security guard and he had explained what was happening. All we heard from reception all week was it's not our fault. We had to buy our own bottled water for drinks.

1537,Spotted Cow,Food,Littlehampton, Pub/Bar,2,Worst Sunday lunch ever.,"Well - I have just returned home at the end of a day when my family and I experienced what must be one of the worst lunch experiences ever.

We arrived at 1.20pm for a 1.30pm booking and were shown to our table. Finally someone took our drinks order at around 1.45pm and the drinks arrived at 1.55pm at which time we were informed that due to lack of kitchen staff it would be another half hour before they could take our food order and then maybe about half an hour more before we would be served. We were asked if we wanted to stay (bear in mind we had just got our drinks) and knowing that it was nearly 2pm and there was probably no chance of getting a table elsewhere we decided to bite the bullet and stay - as long as we weren't charged for the drinks. Which they agreed to.

Our food order was actually taken at around 2.15pm and we waited for our food. And waited and waited and waited. And waited. We complained to the management who, I'm afraid to say, were decidedly unconcerned. In fact I would say that the owner was actually rude in his response. ""Oh, It's coming. It's coming"" he said - as if that was enough.

Finally the food arrived at 3.15pm! One and three quarter hours after the time of our booking. Needless to say, by this time, my family were starving, losing the will to live and almost willing to accept anything. The meals were more or less OK except for one beef dinner which was almost cold. We were offered free desserts but to be honest we just wanted to leave as soon as possible.

If only we had been told about their staffing problems when we first arrived instead of after half an hour we would have had a better chance of finding a lunch elsewhere. I'm afraid that if this is the usual attitude of the owners then they are in for a rough ride in the pub business. We will certainly not be returning and I would advise anyone else to think twice before booking.

However my husband, who did not have a starter, struggled to eat all of his cutlets as he was quite hungry. He is not a “foodie” but even he said they were the worst cutlets he had ever eaten.

Stars were the curried cauliflower veloute and the crab and scallop croquettes, both first courses, and the catch of the day - roasted cod in a chive veloute with light vegetables. Absolutely delicious. The rump steak was also very good. The pastry on the treacle tart was thin and crisp and the rhubarb trifle was beautiful. We couldn't fault it and the place was so busy that the only table we could get was at midday. There was a steady stream of people heading into the restaurant right up until we left at around 2pm.

My grandson is 3 (one and a half last time) and my daughter thought The Seaside apartments sounded nice - don't be fooled like we were.We went in October half term as my other daughter and grandaughter have a different half term to other areas of the country. When we arrived at the apartment we started to unpack the few groceries we had brought with us - I felt quite queasy as the dining table started to move (unstable). everywhere felt sticky and the veneer (if you can call it that) had started to peel off. My grandson's white socks soon became very dirty and slipper bottoms were tacky. We could hardly get into the bathroom (you almost had to get into the shower to get through the door) and we had to call out maintenance twice as the contents of the toilet and sink would not empty and started to fill up. The outside drains had to be rodded. Our front door would not shut properly on a couple of occasions and the windows of the rooms were very poor - condensation and we could not leave the window on the catch to ventilate and the lounge window hinge was buckled. Our friends also had a similar appartment and they left a day early (there were 3 in their group but 6 in ours). We did have a power cut which took out most of the surrounding area and I have to say the staff in the fish restaurant were a delight and kept reasuring us (fortunately we ordered before the power went off so we got our meal). I have already been in touch with a higher authority to complain but I felt I was being patronised and it was if the lady who responded was pacifing me with answers off a script. There was no offer of compensation only that if we were to go again they could offer a discount (we could probably get that by booking on line anyway). It has totally put me off Butlins and sad to say that my 3 year old grandson will probably miss out on family visits like this in the future - there must be other wonderful sites out there.

I didn't bother to have a cake as they clearly couldn't be bothered to sell us them but the kids had a chocolate brownie which tasted of coconut (assume this was coconut flour) and said they were dry. My coffee had the tide out, I assume this was because I had it black and it was all the machine would provide, considering I asked for it black it would have been nice to add a little bit more water but hey like I said service isn't this places forte. And then to top it off at 3:55pm someone shouted to clear the tables as they were closing and then two young girls appeared and cleared our table.

1567,BailiffsCourt Restaurant,Food,Littlehampton, Restaurant,36,Missed a trick,"Friends booked me and a friend a spa day for my birthday . Been before but not overally impressed and sadly after the day even less impressed, in fact we left early. I must just say though the massage I had was one of the best I’d ever had and was very good - but then it should be for the price.

The disappointing factors :
When we got there we asked to have something to eat .. like a brunch, sadly we were told they had nothing to offer us, we asked whether the hotel could provide us with a meal but sadly that wasn’t possible either ..
So my friend and I actually left the premises to go somewhere else for brunch. When we got back we got changed, changing rooms really pokey and smelling of old ladies rest home . Whilst poolside we were hoping someone would come past and offer us a refreshment or something as it was so hot in the pool area, but no staff members were making themselves available , just seemed to be lots of them congregated about at the reception area folding towels , in fact I didn’t see them do anything really other than fold towels unfold towels and fold towels again. Eventually I wandered into the reception area and asked for some drinks . After our treatments again we were offered no refreshments or drinks just put into a room with no one venturing in or out . A while later a friend came in to join us for afternoon tea , once again we found ourselves sat upstairs waiting for someone to come and take some orders, but again no one about , it seems if u want something u have to make your way down to reception each time.
 We were so disappointed we decided to just all leave and and cut our spa day short, and spend our money elsewhere.
 Personally i think it’s madness that bailiffscourt are so short sighted, anyone knows that food and beverage at such a place is your biggest money maker. Clearly they don’t need the business. Most odd. I won’t recommend a day spa. I’d rather drive an hour out of the way, and have better service. Thank you but it’s not for me.

1573,Harbour Park,Attractions,Littlehampton,Amusements/Fun,56,Fantastic First Visit,"We visited Harbour Park on a complete whim after finding ourselves with a free day whilst holidaying nearby, and were very impressed. We had planned to spend a couple of hours there and go home for lunch, but ended up staying nearly until it closed! We found a large variety of rides, and thought it was great value - free entry, and £20 for unlimited rides which our 10 and six year old certainly got their moneys' worth out of! Staff were friendly and helpful and the whole place was very clean.

I would have expected the whole park to be a no smoking area, or for there to be a designated area near the entrance, as a number of people were smoking close to queues which was off-putting. My only other comment would be that something outdoors for little ones would be helpful, like a sandpit or some sort of outdoor softplay area. There is indoor softplay but you can't be in there with a little one if you need to watch older ones outside. After discovering he didn't like the spinning barrel ride my poor one year old just had to stay in his pushchair and watch everybody else have fun all day.

My wife ordered the salad, asking if she could have both the salmon and shrimp as she hadn’t eaten anything today, but was told this was not possible even though both on the menu. This was after placing the order as the waiter didn’t know where the dish was on his tablet then came back. She was advised that if she wanted the shrimp as well it had to be the starter??? Made no sense...

Drinks took ages (had to ask), food took ages (had to ask) then I sent my chicken and waffles back as it was over cooked, dry and burnt (see the photos). The bacon tasted of charcoal, the chicken breast was dry and chewy... even the waffle was crispy and overdone. How it cleared the pass I have no idea, but a replacement came out quite quickly so I assume I was given someone else’s dish. Sorry to whoever that was!!

Overall feeling was staff don’t care, they work hard to avoid your eye so they don’t have to come and help and service is far from important to them. A real shame as we really enjoyed the food the previous time we came... we won’t be going back

Ordered our food which was served almost immediately - alarm bells ring at this point. Had the roast pork which was anaemic - blander it could not have got - more boiled than roasted, and had obviously been sitting in its weak juices quite a while, waiting for me to turn up. But the veg - ahh. The ""chef"" has taken his boiling technique to a whole new level. How shall we do the carrots - let's boil them, same with the greens, same with all the veg. At this point I realised that they do not have a chef, but someone who honed his skills doing school dinners in the 70's.
The gravy on my partners beef was so thin, that they had tried to thicken it with tomato ketchup.
When we came to deserts I thought, well maybe things will improve. Well, they do say that Hope is the last to die, and die it did. The bread and butter pudding was dry as a bone. The kids had ice cream. It came in a tub, and we were informed that they didn't need spoons as there was a plastic one in the lid!

The hotel is quirky and was very surprised at its history. We were a bit disappointed with our room (Le Herne). It was 28°C both days and the room was very stuffy. They provided fan and this did help. There was no view from the window apart from the roof lantern of the breakfast room and the wall of the building opposite. It was too dark and although not a small room, it felt quite claustrophobic and needed to have the lamps on even in daylight. Not a deal breaker but it wasn't what we expected. It was 28°C both days and the room was very stuffy. They provided fan and this did help. The room seriously lacked plug sockets and I would not have expected an extention cable to be provided so we could have a reasonable number of sockets e.g. the lamps on and boil the kettle and use a hairdryer.

The staff are very friendly, attentive and helpful without being overbearing. And the pool service for lunch was very welcome. Our housekeeper was very good and checked in on us the 2nd evening knowing the room was hot. She gave us some good tips on Chichester and recommended other rooms in the hotel if we were returning and wanted a view.

The food on both nights was exceptional and the wine list extensive with wines for all tastes and pockets.

All in all a lovely stay, in a lovely hotel. We would come back, maybe for a winter break but will ask for a different room.

The shrivelled up lamb chops were absolutely tasteless, the only flavour coming out of them was salt everything comes with a ‘salad’ which is a bowl of lettuce with a single lonely piece of cucumber, tomato and olive.

1646,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,104,Day visit from Haven Pagham holiday maker,"Swimming pool - If there is a better swimming pool in UK Id like to know where it is as Butlins new area is superb. Lots of rides, indoor helter skelter, rapids (which go outside!) 2 slides which you almost take off from on the bottom part (so lookout!) inflatable raft slide for up to 3 persons is great family fun (not scary in anyway) , the fastest slide which didnt really cut it for me as expected more and a number of toddler slides running into very shallow water. Fantastic changing areas with huge family cubicles. Gripes are firstly the water temperature is too cold only by 2 degrees or so but noticeable, more importantly air temperature is too low. Kids shivering and adults walking round with arms crossed. I would of thought spending £120m on a swimming pool would buy you top of range heating maybe even negative air pressure so cold air from changing room especially when standing at helter skelter pours into swimming pool and cold air from rapids. The rapids also needs a warning sign that the last pool when re-entering building is 4 times deeper than depth of ride. Many kids got caught out by this sudden change in depth and inhaled water, there are 2 guards in pool but they didnt stop it happening as they naturally are there to help those in trouble so it needs highlighting with signs. Risk assessment here seems lacking. Fairground is excellent many free rides. Food - Finally Butlins gets a fish & chip shop! but food onsite is still generally expensive and hit n miss. Carlyles Cafe and Lobster Pot in Felpham just 300/400 yards away are top class. (The former is cheaper) Red Coats - well compared to Havens version they just dont cut it. If youve been to both you'll know the difference. Most walk around without smiles, look far too formal and are unapproachable.

However everything else was appalling. Firstly the service. They take orders before the speaker giving the kitchen a good hour to prepare. But instead of bringing the meals for one table at a time, the staff wander around asking who ordered what. Two ladies on my table received their meal at least 10mins before the rest. The vegetables which came first, were cold by the time all meals arrived. So the service is chaos.
I ordered chicken Caesar salad. After one mouthful I didn't eat it. No crisp lettuce, no croutons and no parmesan cheese. Chunks of chicken in a dreadful sauce. The other meals were no better. Burnt salmon and a burger bun still partly frozen.

1655,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,49,Not my best experience in a branded hotel,"I booked two rooms, 1 double and 1 twin for 3 nights. In my opinion the rate I took from the call centre after struggling for 3 days on the web, was over charged, especially as the first price quoted before I complained bitterly, was £1,116. I explained as the web page was not working the rate went up from £732 to what I got eventually which was £876. I did complain but was told it was due to availabeilty, which was odd, as the follow days when I got the web page to work, it was cheaper, but the $876 brought me a no cancelation clause. Then came the hotel experience, the twin room had to be changed after checking in, my in laws notice sewage in the bath tub, this was I am told due to a blockage. There were no engineers on the weekend, but the room was eventually changed after being told there were no twin rooms left. Perhaps a misunderstanding, meaning on the ground floor. The doubke room was extremely small, perhpas smaller than advertised and looking a little ""sad"" and well used. The safe battaey needed changing, but after reminding the reception staff, 3 days later it still had not been changed. The staff are very young and in desperate need of training, they never smile, say hello or ask how things are going. There were exceptions of course, but rare. The breakfast had a good variety and was well presented, with additional items for purchase. The hotel location is also very nice. Please note it seems to be a wedding hotel, so Friday and Saturday nights are extremely loud with more than you fair share of people with a little more to drink than normal perhaps.

On entering the caravan and looking around it was nothing like the pics on website, it looked very tired and the living area was cramped, we had no 40 inch tv or hairdryer that was supposed to be included. I rang reception, they were very helpful and offered us a 2 bed prestige caravan , we decided to to transfer to this one and boy was we glad we did,it was nearer the complex and just looked the pics on internet. It was well equipped in the kitchen, the shower was good and a very comfy bed.

The complex was clean and well maintained, the Mash and Barrel served good food that was tasty, drinks were quite expensive, the show bar downstairs was ok, not very quick to clean tables, can’t comment on entertainment as we only saw bits of it. The terrace bar outside near the pool was clean, they just needed to wipe down tables after clearing, also be careful of the padded chairs as they hold water when it’s been raining. We had a vegetable pizza from the terrace bar and that was tasty.

All in all a enjoyable weekend away, with helpful staff and thank you to the reception staff for changing our caravan.

The property has good parking and is on a flat and gentle walk into the delightful town of Arundel. Absolutely ideal. There is also a riverside pathway just next to Portreeves so this gave a choice of pathways to enjoy.

That said Restaurant comes highly recommended. We booked a midweek Spa, Dinner, bed & breakfast package & as members of another H&S hotel Spa had expected to be treated the same. We were actually quite disappointed with the spa treatments (or lack of) a less than proactive front of house & dirty (used) crockery in the bedroom. Overall, this property promises more than it delivers, and as such is not good value for money.

1738,Fino,Food,Bognor, Restaurant,3,An anniversary ruined,"Now to be fair the waitress acted responsibly throughout.
The Aperol Spritz despite instructions on the back of every bottle was terrible the recommended 3 parts prosecco, 2 parts aperol and 1 part soda included at least 10 parts soda if any prosecco at all.
The rump steak was not rare as requested but well done and chewy but the worst was the under-cooked fish on the point of raw, concealed within a wrap of pancetta. This any chef will know is very dangerous and can lead to anisakiasis a parasitic disease caused by anisakid nematodes(worms) invading the stomach wall of humans. Offering to cook it again or replace it with something else just doesn't cut it when you are already beginning to doubt the ability of the establishment.
The waitress offered to replace the Aperol Spritz and took it off the bill. The fish course was also deducted but they left the uneaten fries on £3.

So half eaten steak and half bottle of wine consumed whilst waiting ad nauseum for food is a lousy way of spending an anniversary or any other celebration so I would recommend finding somewhere else that genuinely cares about quality.

1754,Cardanom Bay,Food,Bognor, Restaurant,33,"Amazing food, worst service ever","Let me start by congratulating the chefs at Cardamon Bay tonight for producing absolutely wonderful looking and tasting food, in a very timely manner from when our order was taken, despite a busy Mother's Day service.
However, I can only rate our experience as 1 for the following reasons:
We waited ages to order our food, and eventually had to rather obviously flag someone down.
When I was deliberating over a suitable vegetable dish for my children, I was basically told by a waiter to hurry up because he had other orders to take; it was said in the nicest possible way so I just assumed that he was feeling pressurised and thought no more of it.
However the rudeness continued. When my husband ordered a drink when the food arrived, we were left with no drinks at all until the end of the meal, my older children were sharing out the baby's drink, and my husband was gesturing to the manager at the bar, who kept looking up, then looking away. I managed to catch another member of staff, but after my first sentence, she asked me to ""wait one minute"", ran off, and we couldn't catch another member of staff for at least 5-10 minutes. The member of staff who did eventually take our drinks order was then rude to my husband.
There was also a small incident while we were there. A member of staff accidentally dropped a glass container/bottle which shattered very near a sleeping baby in a carrier, near our table and right next to another customer. The manager asked everyone nearby not to move while they cleaned up, and then proceeded to loudly berate the waitress in her mother tongue, until he noticed people looking and promptly became nicey nicey.
Overall it appeared that members of staff had been given roles that they were not allowed to deviate from despite the obvious need for multitasking and this was unchecked, some members of waiting staff were rude and under pressure and this was unchecked, some front of house staff may not have had the language skills necessary for interaction with and service of customers especially during a busy service, the manager showed very poor form in his treatment of his staff member who had had the accident with glass and he was commanding to my husband when we entirely decided to cancel our second drinks order and pay the bill at the door on exit whilst explaining why we were so disappointed with our experience.
Such a shame. The kitchen team handled the busy service and turned out some gorgeous food, but it was an epic fail for the front of house team led (or not) by their manager. The worst service we've experienced anywhere at least for the last 10 years, if not more.",1,1.0,0.0,Indian,1

1765,Mamma Mia,Food,Bognor, Restaurant,12,"Poor service, BIG ""let down"" ","It was meant to be a ruby wedding anniversary celebration with friends, but ended up being a bitter disappointment following the worst service we have experienced. I made the booking weeks ago and followed it up with a visit to the restaurant two days before. My friend is partially sited so I wanted to ensure we had the table by the window where it was bright.

When we arrived, the table I requested was occupied. We were asked to sit in the middle of the room where it was dark and noisy to wait for the table to become available (why were they not sat at this table in the first place was beyond me?) The waitress came over to take our drink order, we were never asked at any point later in the evening if we would like another....We then ordered our starters and mains at the same time. Food was okay, not overly special, we have all ate far better Italian dishes elsewhere. My meal in particular was warm, not hot, so I found myself eating it quickly before it turned cold. The table was cleared and the dessert menu offered and that's where it ended. We were totally forgotten about. Part of the reason for choosing Mamma Mia was to try the homemade lemon cheesecake as this came highly recommended. We were going to order 4, at just under £20 so fairly highly priced. We waited... and we waited ... To add further insult a very large party of 20+ descended on the restaurant and the staff rallied round like they were celebrities. This was the final straw. I consider it unacceptable to wait in excess for half hour to take a dessert order, who knows how much longer we would have waited had we not requested the bill and left? Disappointed. Will neither return or recommend.

We found the Hotel car park at the rear of the hotel, but after entering through a barrier, I went to get a permit to park the car and was told we would have to pay £10 to park, as we were not staying at the hotel(WHY) the car park was empty!!! Bearing in mind we were about to spend over £100 for lunch. We then left and parked in the road free.
We then went back in to get a coffee while waiting for our friends. The barman looked like we had asked for something unusual ( 2 Americanos), he went across the courtyard as that was where the coffee machine was!
Our friends arrived and the waiter was hovering waiting for us to take our place at our table, this was now about 1pm, the restaurant was completely empty! We were surprised as it was Sunday lunch. We were then told that some of the choices on the menu were not available, the roast only included chicken or Pork Belly(not what you would expect on a Sunday no Roast Beef!). However the food was ok really nothing that exceptional.
Where were all the people, very soulless, heated by a fan heater although they did have an open fire! After time a couple came in for lunch and another for a cream tea.
We left quite disappointed and will not return. We have been to some really superb restaurants in the area nothing like this.

My chicken was over cooked to the point it was burnt and that was the over powering taste of the dish.
The chunky chips had a funky taste to them which was not pleasant.
My sisters vegetarian options were revolting and cold in the middle.

Curries were too sweet and gloopy. Tasted of supermarket bought curry paste.

We have travelled round Thailand and sampled a wide range of thai food, and we are perhaps spoiled by living in London with some very good, authentic thai restaurants nearby.

The armoury and keep were spectacular, the dry moat tour an added and interesting bonus. Having enjoyed the castle we mooched in to Arundel itself, a beautiful town with plenty to do. At 22 quid an adult it's not cheap, but in direct comparison there's so much more to see than at Windsor Castle.

However, those are the only compliments I can mention about this place. We had called and booked and on arrival were shown to a good sized table this is where our evening swiftly went downhill.

The bar-man came over to our table after we had sat waiting for about 20 minutes and begrudgingly said ‘I suppose you would like some drinks’ he took our order, rolled his eyes and went off to make them- clearly a hassle to him!

A further amount of time passed and a lady came over to take our orders. They had mussels on the specials board, which I asked if they could make a starter size portion, if not I would have the Brie. She huffed and puffed and argued it would then be hassle to sell the remaining portion. To which I totally understood and said the Brie would be fine. She continued to make a sarcastic scene of this but agreed to do the starter size.

After about half an hour our starters came out, thus the mussels were cold and very little accompanying mariniere sauce in the bowl.

We ordered a burger and fish and chips for our mains. The burger deemed to be beef, but tasted rather rubbery, was a weird burgundy colour and on the cheap side. Coleslaw, was very watery and chips very oily!

The fish batter was also very oily and peas crunchy!

The food is average pub grub, the staff however are rude and the whole atmosphere was clicky. No one came to check how our food was. No one even said goodbye nor thank you when we left.

We both ordered the Sunday roast lamb. It was £12.95 & very average. Lamb was luck warm, roast potatoes were terrible again luck warm & not cooked in the middle. The veg was a joke, for two of us we got a few bits of broccoli (5 tiny bits) 10 small carrot slices & some red cabbage. I am sure if one person had ordered a roast they would have got same amount of veg. Yorkshire puddings were as flat as a pancake. Asked for extra mint sauce. It was mainly vinegar & very little mint.

I can honestly say this is one of the worst roast dinners I have had.

The ladies toilets were disgusting and both of them were blocked & on the verge of overflowing. Very dirty & looks like they had not been cleaned for ages.

No wifi.

Only ordered 4 things, two roasts & two glasses of wine. Bill was not itemised but seemed expensive. When I queried it turns out they overcharged us £5 for wine!

1810,Travelodge Fontwell,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,52,ABSOLUTELY FILTHY,"This was my first and last trip to a Travelodge. We arrived and despite ringing the bell waited ages for someone to check us in. Our room was filthy - all surfaces were sticky and the bathroom floor was sticky and black - it should have been blue but you could hardly see that. The taps were filthy the sink wasn’t clean and the soap dispensers were empty.
We were there 2 days and saw no one on the reception at all until we checked out so were unable to complain - we were here for a busy social weekend so did not have much time. The only time we saw a member of staff during our stay, he was sitting on the steps outside chatting to someone who was sitting smoking and he had no interest in customers.
Very helpful lady on the Sunday as we checked out and she offered us a refund straight away but said she could not process it and someone would ring me at 3pm that day. Of course no one did. The next day a lady rang and she agreed how dirty the room was - she said he had personally bleached the floor ‘several times’ after our stay as it was so dirty.
She offered us a full refund for the 2 days but said another customer wanted to check in so she would call me back. She called back and said that her head office had refused the refund as we had paid such a high rate for the room - 250 pounds for 2 nights. That was not our fault that is what they charged us - and surely an agreement that someone should not pay should not be dependent on what they paid.
W contacted the head office who advised us that the manager (a man - even though we spoke to a lady who said she was the manager) had already agreed with us that they would only give us a 50% refund, and that it had already been processed on their system as us having agreed. This is totally untrue - we never spoke to a man and the lady offered us a full refund and blamed head office. Just a big bunch of lies to fob us off. No wonder the staff are so slack and couldn’t care less when the head office are setting the same example.
One good point was the lady at reception when we checked out, charming and helpful - she should leave there she doesn’t fit in with the other hapless staff

1815,Establo Lounge,Food,Littlehampton, Pub/Bar,74,When you eventually clear glasses try to wipe the table clean too!!,"Never seen such bad staff practices. Went early Friday evening and not over busy but most tables including ours were sticky and filthy. Most others had glasses on them and eventually a staff member thought to pick some glasses up but heaven forbid she could wipe the table at the same time like numerous bars around the country have mastered over the years. Unfortunately another customer then sees an empty free table and sits down and then realised it was dirty and sticky but no staff members to be seen as I suppose they had picked up some glasses so they could relax again and wait for more to appear. I note the management have made a previous comment that they are trying to get staff to wipe up. Please give them and apron with front pockets to carry a spray, cloth and wipes so they have no excuse not to think that if they pick up a glass they can clean at the same time so the next customer gets a seat at a clean table. Unfortunately the female staff member did her same nonchalant non caring practice at three different tables in 45 minutes between 6.30 and 7.15 last Friday. Shouldn’t be that hard to identify her?? I was visiting out of town with a local who said himself that the place had gone downhill like other comments. Poor Rustington residents .",2,3.0,2.0,British,1
1816,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,4,ABSOLUTE RUBBERY,"So I haven’t yet been to butlins but since booking on the 7th of Jan I am already wishing I didn’t. So as I said I book on the 7th of jan just a few days ago. I happened to check the prices again on the 12th of jan as I was going to book for someone else for the same time. The prices since I book days ago have dramatically drop nearly £200 for the same time in July. I saw online that thr lowest price is guaranteed. So I decided to call and see if there was anything butlins could do since it hasn’t been a week since booking. Well the first lady I spoke to was absolutely useless. The second lady tried to help but I have been told as I book the last apartment available the could not do anything! This is absolutely ridiculous I cannot even cancel and rebook as I would no be receive all of my money back and if I upgraded it would have to be done on the price which I would have received on the day of booking, even tho the price of a upgrade to the difference would be less than £10. I am absolutely disgusted and this will be the first and last time i will be visiting Butlins!!! I wouldn’t be to bothered if I didn’t book less than a week ago and the deal was meant to be up to 30% off and an extra £40 off and now the deal is and extra 30% off and an extra £30 so im a bit confused as to why its cheaper now. I definitely will not be advising anyone to book with them as you’ll never know when to book to get the best deal. Pictures below of the price difference in just a few days!!!!

Not really the way to treat local regulars with this kind of service so left extremely disappointed especially as we had been told that with the new landlord taking over things had improved greatly with the food.

1840,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,0,butlins bognor regis 4 nights stay for tots break programme 3rd june -6th june 2019,"This my first time coming to a butlins resort, i expected high service and standards , i was checked in a place that was noisy and in the middle of there entertainment area called skyline dome for the children which i never expected, i hardly could hear the representative and felt i had to raise my voice, The room location was good near the main entertainment are skyline dome, however it was inconvenience to get up there with a pram and a toddler and my luggage. the room was up a flight of metal staircase that stated its dangerous as it had slip signs. I was not impressed there was no lifts to reach your room. My luggage had to be left by the stairs and taken up gradually, There no security or safety as anyone can help them selves to luggage especially as we had to take our toddler up the stairs with his pram first and put in the room and have 1 of us to look after toddler, whilst the other loaded the luggage 1 by 1 up the stairs to our room.
As a result my nikon camera and camera bag went missing, it was stolen off our trolley, and we did not get it back, be aware there a lot of thief's ,they can be EITHER \ the guest and staff in the resort. if there was a lift we could park our trolley in front of the room and load instantly without losing our belongings to a thief.

Our dinner plan was ridiculous we could not eat later then 6pm under the basic dinning plan which was not stated at the time of my booking I made online or when I went to the resort, I only found out when i was turned away from the restaurant. They have premium dining but you only get another extra 1. 5 hours.

The toilets in the resort do not flush properly you have hard time getting the tissue down let alone your own number 2's. In Our room I had to call for the plumber 3 times ,twice for toilet and once for the shower as the water wasnt going down in the shower tray.Then the hot water tap all of sudden stopped working and my husband and i needed a shower, they was no one at guest services as they close by 8pm. my husband could not find where to go , he enquired with burger king staff as they open until late, they told him to go to the first aid room for security. The security put an alert out for the plumber to sort our hot water out. this was not done until 11pm. he was quick to come but its not great again we have no phone number to call for assistance.

 the entertainment also has restrictions the rides inside catered for my toddler, however the soft play had 2 areas and he was restricted as he was under the height and they do not allow adults to accompany child in the soft play, bizzare as my son a member at cheeky chimps and he can do all the soft play areas without me being there or if needs assistance ,im not allowed to enter and help. They had a animals area but did not know the times for animal to be let out for child to handle. This was not on there programme itinerary. It was great lots of fun activities for children to do on their itinerary programme from play-dough and art crafts and( pottery painting and go karts and mini golf was all extra charges which i did not think was fair as I paid alot of money for the entertainment passes 90 pound person including this rate for my 2 years old.If your into the teletubbies mr men and milkshake mr potato head and paddington bear you enjoy the shows.

The BRAND NEW splash pool thats there has new water pool and slides area it is fantastic for the adults and kids. however again there was restrictions on 2 of the slides my child too small and they would not allow him in the lazy river or the faster log flume. I agree their health and safety risks however i would not endanger my son safety, i held him at all times when i went on the lazy river and did not let him out of my sight. the fast log flume was not that fast, the racer slide was more faster and that did startle my child. I was refused the lazy river on my last day, other days i went on with my child, their staff neglected there duties here, as they did not check my son height the first 2 days at all and allowed us on the ride together. I been to dubai and turkey and egypt they allow my son on the water slides and rides that had height restrictions as sole person, as long as I accompanied him and for further safety they gave mats and inflatable rings.

I recommend to stay on self catering as you can eat at your own time and pace with out feeling rushed. And have a treat at the restaurants that operate later. the fish and chips and the dinner and pub kitchen i recommend highly. papa johns i did not rate it worsen then pizza hut and i only ever go pizza oven bake places like zizzi or pizza express which better.

You get to have photo shoots with the character that they have for entertainment which is great but they need more time slots. And when i went to collect my photos like everyone else did on the last day we felt rushed. as we needed to eliminate photos so we had the best choose. its expensive it cost 35 quid for 5 photos. even then the assistant cut out the pic incorrectly and was refusing to rectify and kept it professional and said ive paid for a service and it expect it perfect.

My last night at the resort we could not get into our room the door would not open, I had to call emergency phone number that was provided to me after I made a complaint about having to go to the guest services in person as no phone provided in the room to call for assistance on our first night when had to go out to get a plumber service. We had a reception area by our room but it was operational only 3 days out of the 5 days being there and for short period of time only. We was not informed about a 24hr services if they was emergency at all. we just had to wait until the morning to get hold of guest services to complain for services we did not received.
They dont even provide basic to be at hand easily like a plastic rubbish bin lining. We had to pop out to get hold of lining bags.
we waited a bout 15 minutes to get our door reopened so we can enter this disturbed my son sleep as it was 930pm and he needed to go to sleep. in the result he ended up weeing himself as he needed toilet and we could not get inside the room. He also caught a mild cold the next day as it was windy waiting outside. my husband got a cold as well. The door battery was changed by another technician as the first technician just tried using a master key to open the door, so he came ill- prepared. Finally we got in,
The outdoor play areas great you have 3 playgrounds for the kids. then a cars driving school area , archery, football, and mini golf areas. The traditional fairground area looked better in the pictures, when we got there it needs re painting to brigthen up, there restricted times again it opens 10am until 4pm. if only it stayed open until 6pm. Again height restrictions in place for toddler on certain rides, however the most ridiculous was the bumper cars, I went recently to chessington adventure world park, and my son was allowed to go on the bumper cars, I have been to locaL fairgrounds in my area and he been allowed here he was not allowed, even though he be accompanied by an adult who drive the bumper car. As a result not many parents used the bumper cars as they had toddler my son height. I complaint to the guest services and they said the safety regulations are set by the ride company however I been to chessington park which is more of a specialist in rides and they allowed my son? I felt the guest services just made poor excuses and were controlling the situations to there advantage so toddler are kept restricted.

The go karts area allowed children over 97cm on with adult however this was not clear to me I was told as long as my toddler was over 90cm when i waited over 20 mins and it was our turn my son was measured and we told we cant take the go kart course. we went to get refund and told why and it was obvious because of ,my son height. The the helter skleter ride i got to the top and turned away it was a very steep climb and exhausting as i carrying my toddler. refused for not having a long sleeve top on. I wasnt told this before been handed the sacks to sit on by the assistant. I was very annoyed and frustrated. as it was tight squeeze to get pass other parents and children to climb back down the steps.
Yet this was called a tots break events programme.

Overall they good point and bad but the accommodation, checkin area improved alot. and after hours services need to be explained better, the information pack provided did not have any contact number or information to say where to go for after hours emergency. only had an email which isnt gonna be a fast response like a phone call is. Entertainment passes need to be reduced for a toddler rate, Also the fairground rides height restrictions changed on certain rides that are safe for toddler when accompanied by adults. yet this is called a tots friendly break programme

 urgent attention is for wheelchair person could not have the apartments as they do not cater for them and this is the cheaper alternative. there no lifts for them to access either or wide paths to get around and to your apartment room.

Food is ok, though they do not have anything like it is stated on the menu. The main courses like lamb shank, salmon is spotless, great, but the side dish is not what you order. With none of the orders. They provide a few vegan food, but more then half of it they ran out. (On a Sunday it means the restaurant is not prepared for guests.) It is hard for a vegan person.
Not mentioning the problems with the coffee.
Payment is complicated f you want to share the bill with your friends. Basically a menu is thrown to you and calculate and figure it out on your own what you ordered and need to pay.

The food took ages to arrive and when it did the chips were extremely overcooked. I complained to the waitress who happily brought us one replacement portion (we had originally ordered 3 portions in total). However, we thanked her and carried on with our meal. After the meal my 6 year old found a £2 coin on the floor, he was so chuffed with himself, even having a bit of childhood banter with his brother (finders keepers losers weepers ect). When the waitress came with our bill he happily told her what he had found, she responded by saying that she had lost 1 earlier so it must be hers. I lightheartedly wished her luck trying to get it back off him, and he carried on similar banter with the waitress as he had been doing with his brother (he is 6!). She told him he was rude and that it was hers and she had earned it. I was flabbergasted that a member of staff could talk to a young child like that. When she returned to take our payment she turned to my son and asked him if he was going to give it back to her (which surprisingly he did with out having a meltdown). I could not believe my ears, had it been a note I could of understood it a bit better (not her attitude) but taking a £2 coin from a young child (who thought he had won the lottery) is not acceptable in my book.

We went straight to the new swimming pool which is awesome and had sections to suit everyone.....a small children area with slides and another section with a splash zone then a wave zone & a area where you can swim and where it's deeper water mostly suited for the adults.....
Lots of slides and a family ride & the Rapids is so much fun we were in there 3 hours with our 3 little ones....
Then went to hv dinner at the pub located on the Resort then headed to fun fair not realising it closed at 6pm.
But that's why I hvnt given 5 stars!
The rides are meant to close at 6pm but most were closing at 5.50!!! My little girl was told she silent go on the ladybird's as he was closing it was 5.52! Not 6pm....then my boys went into soft play area and got to top then told to get out as they were closing!!! Why let children in if your going to close minutes later??
So we headed outside to the slide & it was 5.56 and got turned away again!!! Apparently they only get paid up to 6pm so they were closing up early other rides were still open!!! They were both very rude and said well it may not be 6pm but we only get paid till 6pm so we are off they were very rude!
I went and complained to Guest Services with another 2 guests and upset children and it was arranged to be reopened for our children to all have a go! But I hope that the staff member will be doubt with! As he didn't seem to care much about the children beingnuoset & was not professional at all.

How disappointing

I'm not sure who designed the new layout, but to only have 1 till is crazy. I've also never seen so many staff in there, in total I counted 8 front of house staff (which is more then it had before it closed and was really busy) and out of all of them, the only one I saw doing any work was the heavily pregnant waitress, the rest were just stood around doing nothing!

1854,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,3,Centerparcs this is NOT,"With a young family we have stayed at Centerparcs many times and thought we'd give Butlins a try.

We booked a Nelson stateroom in the Shoreline Hotel, arriving on the hottest weekend this year.
 The air conditioning was broken. It took the team 4 hours after much pestering to inform us it was not repairable(no surprise)
After a visit to assess the heat level they agreed it was not acceptable and we would be relocated.
This was to the Wave hotel, the other side of the complex. It was gone 8pm. We were unable to move the car as the Wave car park was full. We trapsed with kids in pyjamas ladden with bags across the complex,with not one teeny weeny offer of help of anysort.

So just be aware, that is the level of customer service they offer if things go wrong.

You can pay very good money but don't expect the level of courtesy to families that Centerparcs on the other hand offer.

On a positive note the show was great,rides well staffed, pool lovely(though not quite as good as Centerparcs) But be prepared for spending a long time queuing for ...everything!
Hope this may just help if you are considering a first visit with little ones.
We lost a precious day of a very short weekend break with overtired kids, thanks to Butlins.

They will not even think to say hello to village locals who have been in their pub many times
Things got worse than the cold atmosphere as the Food served was really awful, yukkkk nasty

Drink selection ok

Even if you consider this as only a local pub it still falls very short of acceptable,

In fact it seems to get worse each time we visit it, the only redeeming point is the garden on a sunny day

It is very obvious that the landlord and partner have no interest in the hospitality industry, they seem to have no interaction with their customers at any point, very strange!!!

SO mr and mrs Landlord “ if you hate this hospitality life then we suggest sell up and move on !!!

The Food really terrible, obviously it was precooked, frozen and then microwaved to within an inch of its life
It was really bland , hot as hell and disgusting , we ordered fish and chips, calves liver and mousaka,

The bathroom appeared to have been modernised in recent times - all really good apart from an 'old fashioned' fixed shower head that was not controllable. A shame, as everything else had been brought up to date nicely.

Tea and Coffee making facilities and hairdryer were in the room as you wold expect, and the TV, although small was picking up the full range of freeview stations.

Breakfast was good in both range and quality - all served with a smile and cheery conversation in the main dining room with mirrors,chandeliers and old world charm.

So, a standard chain hotel this is not - and its also not the most modern in style. However, it is a great place to stay for being on the front at Bognor Regis, and within walking distance of the railway station/town centre. A real 'old charm' hotel with character and personality",4,4.0,0.0,0,0

Our waitress was really outstanding and so accommodating. Our starters were fine but 4 of our main meals were horrible. 2 rump steak rolls and 2 rump steaks. We could not eat this as it was so chewy and we wondered if it was rump! We showed the waitress as we had leftmost of the rump on our plates. We were not offered any kind of refund or even a percentage off our bill. Besides that our friends who were visiting us from Oxford saw the man who was at the reception desk who was so rude to us discussing our group with a colleague and pointing at us as we left.

We opted for food court dining and the highchairs were so dirty that we couldn't strap our baby in as he mouths everything and the straps were crusted with old food. The food was also very disappointing , not the standard we had previously seen at Bognor at dinner time. It was far too beige and some limp lettuce and tomato with cucumber was pretty much all of the salad that was available. The breakfast was perfectly lovely though.

Also in the food court , we found it to be much , much busier than the previous Easter. There were poor customers queuing for a table with tired children and people hung around our table wait information for us to finish. We went to a paid restaurant on our last night as we were so sick of the dirty , busy food court.

The only good thing about our dining choice was a young staff member named Kieran. He greeted us all with such cheer that every family walked away from him smiling. I hope Butlins are paying him well!

The apartment wasn't cleaned very well , we found a bottle of beard oil , and some sweet wrappers in our bedroom. Also our bedroom door handle was hanging off.

I ordered the venison burger. Which to be fair was OK. But had salad on the side which tasted really odd

Friend I was with ordered mixed kebab. There was no lamb so was just chicken and pork. This was inedible. The meat was so dry it could not be eaten

My Nan had the crab risotto which did not have hardly any crab in it, was spinkled on the top.
The timing was out as 3 of our meals came out together & the vegetarian came out 4-5 mins later.

1887,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,5,Terrible experience,"We spent 3 nights at the Wave hotel. On arriving back to our room on the final day we noticed our games console was missing. One of the controls had been thrown on the floor and the console itself was nowhere to be found. From the outset Butlins gave the impression it wasn’t really their problem. They called the resort officer to conduct a door audit to see who had been in and out of the room during that day. It showed only ourselves and housekeeping. They proceeded to check with housekeeping whether any one had found the missing item - and lo and behold - no one had.
We’ve since returned home and had a phone call to say that they haven’t been able to recover the item and their investigation ends there.
All I can say is to warn you - do not be too comfortable in Butlins accommodation. We made the mistake of not putting our valuables in the safe - I would advise everyone to do so to avoid being targeted by the thieves who hide amongst the housekeeping staff. We are lucky enough to have travelled all over the world and never had an item from our belongings stolen from our accommodation.
It was out of the ordinary for us to holiday in the UK and now this has put us off Butlins and the like for good!
My advice, don’t leave any valuables out, don’t trust housekeeping staff and don’t rely on the resort to offer any real help when things go wrong. Not a safe place where you can feel at home.

The changing rooms were nice and large however, they were filthy with rubbish, hair and even what looked like blood wiped down the wall with a finger! There was also hair and floating skin in the puddles in the queues up the stairs to the family raft. In the baby pool there seemed to be something floating in the water that looked like phlegm/snot! There were even people swimming with their outdoor clothes on. Totally unhygienic.
The slides had massive queues (fair enough when its holiday season) but when the queue time is made even longer than it should because they do not have enough rafts to cater for demand. Staff said they started off with 7 rafts but are down to only 4 now. Sort this out managers instead of making people wait longer than the queue time says. 20 minute expected time took 35 minutes just for a slide ride over in less than 30 seconds!
Teenagers were pushing in the queues in front of smaller children, including running and barging past, when I raised this issue with a member of staff nothing was said or done about it.
Two of the slides were also under 18's only. I don't see the sense in that when there were some teenagers around 12 stone or more when there were much smaller/petite adults wanting to go on. It should be done on weight NOT AGE! Never seen a large slide closed to adults anywhere else.
In all, a total and utter let down, badly managed and not once did I see anyone cleaning the filth during open hours. Other leisure centres have staff walking around with watering cans to rinse away hair and grime.
Such a shame it is going to rack and ruin already with no standards for peoples health and safety.

Arrived to find we are parked in the lobby.
Wait and wait.
Enquire about table - “it is being prepared”.
After 15 minutes - “it is being prepared”.
Is there a table? “Did you make a booking?”
Book showed we are one of three bookings - clearly our table has been given away.
Offer to have take-away. “No”.
Get to table at last. No one to take order.
Eventually food arrives - but our main courses. Where are our starters?
Hopefully you get the picture - chaos!
We did start to eat eventually. However allowing all the guests to arrive at the same time is asking for trouble. Of course the kitchen and the waiters can’t cope.
It would have been so simple to have said “No, we have no table reserved for you. No, we can’t serve you very soon, No, you will have to wait and No we can’t serve a takeaway as the kitchen is unable to cope.
We would have gone somewhere else but returned on another day.
The food is good, the waiter was sorry and able to laugh with us and was appologetic.
Will we ever go again - No we will not. There are other restaurants that don’t provide chaos as an additional side-dish!

whilst I appreciate that any place can be affected by staff absence/shortages, 2 members of staff thought it more important to be setting up a closed area of the restaurant for the following day, leaving just 2 waiting staff to look after the rest of the restaurant. It was very busy with several large parties and several dishes on the menu were sold out.

The 1/2 we were there the owner spent chatting to some chap about his holidays the she owed him her holiday pics then when asked by another man how hot it was she gave him chapter & verse of the temperature & the fact she'd not unpacked yet!!not once did she acknowledged us it was left to 2 very young girls to do the cooking & serving.

The restaurant is clean and smartly decorated, good amount of seating and laid out so as not to be too close to other tables. The kitchen is open so you can see the chef's busying about getting the food ready. They had their own craft bitter which was lovely and very nicely priced. The carvery spread looked awesome but we went from the a la carte menu; sloppy Joe burger - lovely and juicy, stuffed chicken, again cooked and served perfectly and my little boy had a very generous and tasty spag bol. We were in a bit of a hurry (11 month old on the edge of over-tiredness) so didn't get desserts but never felt the wait was long.

It was nicely busy for a Tuesday evening and I'd imagine booking would be sensible at weekends and during holiday times.

Luckily this wasn’t too far as being pregnant I was already exhausted! On opening the door to our room it smelt of cleaning products which is always a good sign! And it felt clean. The bathroom itself was clean and there were fresh towels. There were spares on the shelves just outside of the bathroom which is handy! In the room there was a king size bed along with a pull out single for my son to sleep in. Both in clean condition, clean sheets and both beds comfortable. Extra pillows on the selves as well as a fan if needed. A TV was available with freeview which was ideal as we spent the evening relaxing. There was a kettle with cups/sugar/teabags/coffee/milk for tea and coffee which we didn’t use in the end but was nice to know this was available to us. There is no restaurant on site but there is a Burger King/KFC a 5 minute walk around the corner. There is also a little Pub a few minutes drive away that we passed but did not go in. Chichester itself is only a 10 minute drive away from big supermarkets (Sainsbury’s/Lidl etc) which is ideal if you are staying away for a little time. Overall the room we stayed in did the job for us, there was barely any noise even though the Travelodge is situated by a busy road which some people have previously mentioned in other reviews. It may have been the room we were in but given that we only spent the night it did the job nicely. Thank you very much to the two members of staff who welcomed us. Will be back.

The games room had no air con all week, the machines kept braking. The guys working in games area were really helpful but having used some of the machines for the last few years the difference was really quite noticeable. The restaurant, what’s happened. Price has gone up and the quality gone down. Food looks like it just thrown on the plate. Kids food supposed to come with veg, the only one that did came with raw, dried up carrot swirls that were all dried out!! Having eaten in the restaurant most nights for the last 3 years, we only went twice and said we wouldn’t go again. Salmon salad was like old bits of lettuce that should have been thrown out. Stir fry was over cooked, sloppy and tasted horrid. Chicken burger came with a small handful of thrown on chips, rest of the plate was empty. I understand it isn’t a 5* restaurant but having had some nice food and service from that restaurant before it was more noticeable. Every drink we ordered came in dirty glasses, we were told it was just water marks but they were grim with lipstick marks, old bits of dried lemon!! Tried to get a slush on three occasions, each time the machine wasn’t working. It’s a shame as the clubhouse as always been good value for money but this time it was awful.

The reception staff were pleasant enough if you asked a question but the general feeling was that no one really cared .Considering the cost of the day I felt that I had been to better spas and even one of their sister venues gave better service .This is a beautiful place to visit but the staff need to up their game to make it a special experience .

The positives - nice atmosphere, friendly staff, and the starters. And that’s really where it ends. My son had a burger which was cooked beyond recognition. He still ate it, but that was through sheer hunger. As for me, I ordered a medium rare steak. Alas, it was probably the most well done steak I’ve ever had. I had one bite and left the rest. Far credit to the waiter though, as he spotted this and said he wouldn’t charge for my plate. Still hungry, I ordered a sticky toffee pudding. Don’t make that mistake. It was an insipid, dry sponge with a small amount of frankly disgusting toffee sauce on top. It resembled no STP I had ever seen. Again, one mouthful and I couldn’t eat any more. Then, to top it all, they completely forgot about bringing out a pudding for my father in law’s birthday. All in all, it wasn’t a celebratory night.

Emma just looked at me as if I had taken a crap on the bar, and snarled ""you have to pay for those"" so I apologised and said how much do I owe you for an olive, apprantly £2:40 as they can't sell them after I removed one because of a potential allergy problem? I did explain that no prices are marked anywhere, that fell on deaf ears, I ended the conversation with a comment about needing a crystal ball. So I brought a bowl of olives that I didn't want, although the sign on the wall said they come with bread, they don't.
It doesn't end there... When the food came out another Emma, even ruder than the first one, had a go at me for moving tables after ordering food, I did maintain that I hadn't moved tables at all, but it appears it was our fault that someone had moved the table number before we sat down, I have never been spoken to as badly as I was tonight.",1,3.0,0.0,British,1

Very rude waitress (and older woman) who didn’t ask how our meal was even though when collecting our plates over half the meal was left on them.

A nice warm greeting from Ray at the entrance to the park, who directed us to the reception desk. An easy check in, lots of staff waiting to check you in quickly. The caravan was spotlessly clean, the van didn’t smell or look tired. It was an upgrade pd modern caravan with 3 bedrooms and an en-suite, large fridge, central heating and had a small decking area outside. The park is a quiet park which suited my oap parents. They love it here, as it’s picturesque and peaceful. The lagoon and shingled bench is worth a visit and the nature trail is pretty. Remember to take your binoculars to be able to see some wildlife. The indoor pool was clean, the arcade centre has lots of 2p machines( so start saving them) most of the machines payout tickets and there’s lots of prizes to chose from. My parents played lawn bowls and really enjoyed it, there’s also a zip wire and large trampoline. The average price of a pint is £4 and above. Bar area was clean and tidy, lots of seating available. Overall a really nice relaxing holiday. This won’t be the last visit, can’t wait to rebook and return. Keep up the good work at Church farm as it’s the best Haven site I have visited so far!

2014,Butlins Day Visits,Attractions,Bognor,Amusements/Fun,21,Butlins you should be ashamed,So after hearing about this multi million pound leisure facility we were thrilled to be local enough to go and try it out. As you enter it's the usual packed holiday resort pool with unisex changing. All seemed well until my partner and daughter went on the 2 big water slides there is available. On their return I took 1 look at my partner and knew all was not well. What's wrong I asked. Pubes all the way up the stairs. So we moved to the rapids. Which clever person thought it was a good idea to make wet people queue in front of an open doorway was clearly from Antarctica. I gave up and left the family to it. On route to the changing room I stopped briefly in the baby pool to get warm to be whistles at by 2 members of staff not 2 feet away from me. Not once but several times both of them. I wouldn't have minded if they weren't in talking distance!!! Ok so I can complain about the reason the only warm pool n the complex was being cleaned as all kids have accidents sometimes. I decided to take myself off to get changed. Stopped off in the loos which were at least a cm deep in other people's wee. Grimaced while I sat on layers of loo roll. Found myself a cubicle to change in BONUS! Went to pop my towel down on the floor to stand on and noticed the floor was dirtier inside the complex than outside and had a nice matting of what I can only assume was all the hair from the opening months customers. Omg get me out of this hell Hole!! It's been open a month the nice young girl politely smiled and told me when I asked show long it had been open.

2017,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,126,"Looks nice, reasonable value but VERY noisy","We stayed here solely because we were attending a wedding and the room was pretty cheap. There was a long queue at check-in and rather brusque staff.

The room itself was ok (122) apart from the fact that the bathroom door only opened about halfway before being blocked by the sink.

Drinks and food in the hotel were pretty expensive. Service at the bar was VERY slow and on one occasions I had to go and hunt down a member of staff to serve us.

But the WORST thing about the place is what appears to be a complete lack of soundproofing! You could hear people in other rooms in all directions - and the corridor seemed to have been specifically designed to be noisy to walk along with the characteristics of an echo chamber.

So, in summary, pretty cheap - for obvious reasons.

2018,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,110,Goodbye Bognor,"This is my third consecutive holiday with Butlins, for the last 2 years we’ve stayed at Skegness and we’ve not been disappointed by our stays there.

This year we decided to stay at Bognor Regis instead, we fancied a change of scenery and having previously been to Minehead many years ago it was about time we tried out Bognor so we could compare all three resorts.

Well let me tell you from our personal experience Bognor isn’t the place to be. So where do I begin...

Well checkin was very chaotic. Given rough directions where to drive round to in order to check in and got a bit confused by this. No one around to direct you. When we got to the checkin area it’s a small round room where everyone does the British thing of queuing around the room and out the door. While the process was fairly smooth it was chaotic you couldn’t hear yourself think with so much going on.

3pm it was time to go to our room, on arrival it seemed to be okay but then we realised it wasn’t up to scratch. Hairs in the bathroom sink, shower was dirty, wrappers left behind bedside cabinets, dirt on the floor in the bedrooms. Not impressed. Back to the checkin desk where the lovely lady there I think called Tracie who was great arranged for housekeeping to come back. Literally 15 minutes later a lovely cleaner arrived and was shocked at the state of the rooms. She did an amazing job and the accommodation was spotless. However as we used the accommodation we noticed more problems. Bulbs out in various rooms, bathroom extractor fan not working etc. Back to checkin and Tracie again got it dealt with.

The next day we took a trip to Splash world. Lots of singing and dancing about how it’s all brand new etc. Bit disappointing from an adults point of view. Lots of rides for kids but only 2 for adults excluding the 1 family ride and no where really to have a proper swim. The wave pool had to be shut twice due to metal bars coming loose and floating into the pool. Considering this is brand new it’s rather shocking. Half the changing rooms where blocked off too and while this is great there is a machine to dry your swim wear only 1 was working so queues for that. Yes I get it’s a family place etc but it’s all catered really for young children and teens. Surly a decent thing would of been to refurbish the old pool and have both?

That same evening there was a major power cut in Bognor and while this isn’t something Butlins can do much about, staff where running around like headless chickens not knowing what to do. You’d think a resort this size would have backup generators to even just supply main lighting to main buildings and accommodation but clearly not. I get it’s not something Butlins can control but communication could of been better. As a result of the power failure our evening meal was a no go but Butlins gave us £30 of vouchers to use on restore which was a nice touch. Thanks to DJ in guest services.

Other niggles, shower in the room is like a trickle of water, maintenance replaced the shower head but no change. Towels are only replaced with clean ones on Wednesdays and Sundays (Unlike Skegness where it’s daily and more are given if asked, though I asked for more it was a struggle). Layout of the whole place is a bit poor so much waking to get to/from accommodation to entertainment etc.

We met a lovely couple at Bognor Regis too who where staying at the Shoreline Hotel. They also had problems with leaking toilet, bulbs out etc and maintenance had to go to their room multiple times so it appears the general maintenance of the camp is very poor.

And where do I start on the entertainment. Reds was closed so only entertainment really was on Centre Stage and it was a bit piss poor really. Elton John, ABBA etc while all great music it’s sung by the same people each night. Just an excuse to save money I guess by using in house singers who can’t give a proper performance. Really poor performance here Butlins.

Best part of the entertainment was the Panto. 10/10 really funny and a great laugh for all the family. Have seen them over the last 3 years and they’ve all been amazing!

Overall it’s not the best out of the 3 sights, personally I think Skegness has the upper hand over all 3 resorts. I’d rather go to Minehead or Skegness in the future. While I’ve booked next years break on resort with the lovely Sarah who i must add was great during our stay helping us with our booking for next year and even our assisting guests during the power failure, my stay won’t be here at Bognor. My stay is booked for Skegness.

Thanks Bognor you’ve been well ummm... not great.

Also for note Bognor town seemed rubbish no decent arcades or shops for rock etc open in October a week before half term! Seemed like a ghost town.

2019,Premier Inn Littlehampton,Accommodation,Littlehampton,Hotel,4,Premier Inn Littlehampton Hotel,"The heating system was not working. We were not informed of this fact until after trying to get it working we then asked at reception and we were then informed that there was a technical problem and they offered no consideration to us of the inconvenience this caused. Reluctantly a staff member asked if we required a backup heater as only a few were available, this was accepted by me but proved to be inadequate. This condition continued for the whole weekend duration. The heating was also lacking in the attached Premier restaurant so we were unable to enjoy a comfortable evening. Further the bar staff seemed to be pre-occupied causing a delay in service and were very lax although there were few people patronising the bar. Our order of coffee during the evening was undrinkable so with some embarrassment I returned them to the bar staff. I was THEN informed the coffee machines were not working correctly so our money was refunded so we returned to our cold uncomfortable rooms. On leaving I wished to register my complaints however although we waited 10 minutes no member of staff attended the reception desk. We left having spent an unhappy weekend which upset myself, my wife & my friends .If I had not prepaid I would have requested compensation.

2020,Royal Norfolk,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,10,Awful breakfast seating and bad service all round.,"The seating arrangements were ridiculous. Your table at breakfast is prearranged, so regardless of where you would like to sit in practically empty restaurant, everyone was sat in two rows with about six inches between the tables. Not ideal when you need to have private conversations or when you want a relaxing breakfast.
Expect a long wait. The waitress was run off her feet and did a splendid job, whilst the manager walked around doing very little. Everyone had to wait and sit around uncomfortably close together.
The full English was more like a child’s meal. The standard of the ingredients was very poor, especially considering it’s a restaurant.
When I told the manager that the organisation of the breakfast service needed reviewing, especially the seating arrangements and staffing, she replied they have to prearrange the seating as it’s easier for them.
Which says it all really, its customer service is clearly not a priority.
With nothing to do but seat people, and this being prearranged, isn’t the restaurant managers job a bit redundant?

2025,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,20,Nice place but limiting for under 2s,"We just came back from a just for tots break that we really enjoyed. We would come back again when our son is older.

There was lots to do in general with a lovely new pool and right on the sea. The staff kill you with kindness every minute of the day. You can’t beat the value for money although I wouldn’t bother with DineAround as half the place is shut at any one time and lots of places serve until just 6pm.

Unfortunately we wouldn’t recommend it for infants as we felt that Butlins didn’t do enough to cater for them.

Right from the start our room didn’t have a cot that we pre booked months ago then we had to ask 3 times to sort it and you just wouldn’t get that happening ever in certain rival resorts. It was a bottom of the range travel cot so we’d just bring our own time. There was lots of other things that stopped him sleeping like no door on his room, hotel music in the corridor at nap time, housekeeping at nap time etc.

The shows seem lovely but the show times didn’t suit an infant and the number of shows per day was always 1-2 usually with one or both when an infant would sleep. The shows are always rammed and we tried to turn up 15 minutes before one of the lesser morning shows to find ourselves squinting from a distance standing, the demand is clearly there for more shows and the stages are idle most of the time.

He loves the swings but there are only 2 infant swings for the entire site, our room over looked them so we did our best to pick our moment but they were queues all day. Other resorts do have this few swings but why attract so many toddlers at once and not cater for them.

The majority of the issues we had seem to be around money so maybe it wouldn’t be as great value if they are fixed, either way we would return with a 3 year old.

2026,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,44,"Ocean hotel weekend, would have been 5 stars if not for a few issues","This is a bit of a long review, but after reading many useful reviews before booking, I'd like to return the favour. First part is about the hotel, 2nd about the resort itself. Have just returned from a weekend break staying in an Atlantis Room on the 2nd floor of the Ocean Hotel. We paid for a sea view but didn't upgrade to a top floor room as I'd read a great tip on here about the top floor having no shelter on the balcony if it rained, so we decided we'd stick to a lower floor. This worked out well, as the balcony was sheltered nicely from the wind too, so lovely to sit out on.
My husband and I went with our adult son and his 5yr old daughter- they shared the twin bed kids den. The beds aren't bad sizes, but not advisable for anyone over 6ft. The kids room doesn't have a door, but there is a wall mounted tv, funky decor and mood lighting. We only had a storage box under one bed, not both like I think you are supposed to get, but this wasn't an issue. The main space had a double bed with units either side. The padded headboard has very funky mood lighting above and the beds were comfortable. The bed also has storage space underneath ( I didn't discover this until the 2nd night) handy for putting suitcases or bags. You get a few hangers for the wardrobe, plenty of shelving space, a 3 drawer chest unit (under the wall mounted tv) a dressing table area with mirror and stool and hairdryer. There is a personal safe, iron and ironing board and mini fridge ( we fitted 1 litre cartons of milk, 500ml bottles of water in there fine) The room also has 2 chairs and a side table. There are plenty of lights and the curtains are nice and heavy. The patio doors lead out on to the balcony, where there were 4 chairs and a table. Our room looked out over the new pool and fairground and you could also see the sea. I was really pleased with the room, Years ago we stayed in gold apartments but nowadays I just didn't fancy that and the hotel appealed to us. It's set out really well- luckily the lifts were working, but as we were on the 2nd floor it wouldn't be a problem. We didn't book a dining package, but we did pay to have breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning, which was good. I can't fault the breakfast- massive choice- the omelette station is fab ( omelettes made to order) Staff are lovely there, some other diners not so though ( families piling up plates, making loads of mess, leaving loads) Again it's a personal choice and I'm a bit of a snob! That said if I come again, I'd probably book the breakfast dining package as I think it is actually a good deal. I think the hotel is lovely and the staff are so friendly and helpful. We unfortunately had to make a few trips to reception to get a few problems fixed and they were always lovely. Our main problems were the tv's. The kids tv didn't work at all and we were awoken at 3.10am by our main tv coming on really loudly on the news channel ( a previous guest had clearly decided to play a joke on someone and give them an early morning wake up) My husband went to reception to explain the issue Saturday morning and they sent someone up within 10 mins from housekeeping. They got the kids tv to work and after a bit of hassle were confident they had reset our tv to stop the alarm. Saturday evening our tv decided it only wanted to show 2 channels, we spoke to reception and they sent a tech up who changed the lead and sorted that problem, Brilliant! However Sunday morning we were again awoken at 3.10am by the tv coming on loudly. So loudly it woke all of us up this time. Back to reception who were horrified and promised to fix or change the tv ( we asked if they couldn't fix could they just take it out- as there is no off switch )Again they were lovely and promised to get it sorted. This morning ...you've guessed it- 3.10am wake up call courtesy of our tv. Again staff lovely and so apologetic, they offered to get the manager to talk to us, but we didn't want that. We just asked them to please change the tv so it doesn't happen to other guests. If it was to wake a small baby up that would ruin a families night. Credit to the staff, they were fab, but clearly this tv wasn't having it. It's a shame as I'm a rubbish sleeper so couldn't go back to sleep the first night and struggled the 2nd and 3rd after it happened, so I'm a bit shattered now I'm home. However if it hadn't been for the tv issue we wouldn't have any complaints with the hotel. The daily housekeeping is fab- as others have said the towel animals are a lovely touch. The power shower is great, lovely and powerful. We didn't use the spa as this weekend was about our granddaughter, but it looked really nice. The hotel has its own car park which we got a space in no hassle even though we didn't arrive until 5pm on the Friday. It's ideally located within a few minutes of the new pool, fairground and pavillion, so perfect for tired legs after an evening out. It's all very clean and tidy.
 The resort itself we hadn't visited in about 14 years- some things have changed, but not everything, so it was nice to recognize old favourites but also see the new improvements. The main one being the new pool- which opened the day before we arrived. It looks great and in many ways it is great- just a few teething problems. On our first visit the garden rapids weren't working , but the flumes, slides, kids pool and wave machine all were. It's a clever design- it doesn't look that big, but it never felt overcrowded when we visited , even though there were lots of people in there. The hotel guests get a special time slot of 8am-9am on Saturday, which is handy- there is also a tots slot I think too. The small kids slides on the Saturday had hardly any water around them and a dad warned us to catch our granddaughter as she came down the slide as his daughter had scraped all her leg up coming off the slide. On the Sunday when we visited we noticed the water was a lot deeper around these slides, which hopefully solved that issue. The little jacuzzi's were freezing and in a few parts of the pool it wasn't warm at all. The wave pool is though and it's really great- they play music when the waves are on and the kids love it. Unfortunately on Sunday this wasn't working. This time the garden rapids were- well sort of. Nothing rapid about them, we had to push ourselves along them and my husband scraped his back up on it. Also one of the big slides were it joins had the same issue- the way you come down it, can scratch your back up. I think they will get these teething problems fixed though. There is something for all ages there and it's definitely going to be an asset. The lifeguard ratio to guests (especially on Sunday) was very good. The changing rooms and lockers are great- I think there are going to be issues keeping the floors clean- there was a lot of hair and fluff all over them.
The fairground is good- it doesn't look like there is a lot there, but there are quite a few rides and except the go karts, they are all free. They had a late opening 7-9 on Sunday night which was nice- great atmosphere for the last night. I can see there are many more chargeable activities but there are still many free ones. We only paid for one extra activity- the skyline dance academy- which was a huge success. Our granddaughter loved it. It was supposed to be an hour long but lasted an hour and a half and her enjoyment made it well worth the money. Although not Easter yet, this was under the Easter breaks, so there were free activities like an egg hunt where you solve a puzzle and get a little chocolate egg ( with a Bonnie and Billy Bear egg cup)or the spring farmyard animals.
B-line passes-hmmm not sure about these. We bought them as none of us were up for long queues. They work well- sort of. You get in 15 mins before everyone else and have a separate queue. So although you still queue, there are only a certain amount of b-line passes, so you know if you arrive near the time you will get in, you shouldn't be in too big a queue. It worked great Friday night for Centre Stage for Sleeping Beauty. We got there about 10 mins before we were going to be allowed in and the queue wasn't bad at all. Here is the thing though..they set up chairs in rows at the front,then there are tables at the sides and then more tables on the next level further back. If you want to be in the front rows, then buy the passes. If you want a table- then it's not so certain. Friday night we got a great table, good view and probably wouldn't have without the pass. Saturday night we were first in the queue for Centre Stage and they had technical difficulties and the doors opened late. We were the first let in on the b-line passes, and got the table we wanted, but less than 5 minutes later we were joined at the next table by people from the general queue who quite loudly remarked what idiots people were who bought the b-line passes as they were a waste of money. Couldn't help but feel he was right. That night we saw Paddington and just as it finished we were all evacuated due to an issue ( no clue what). the whole pavillion was shut down and we were all led outside. No one knew how long it would be shut down, but staff said probably at least half an hour. It was freezing outside and there was no way we could leave a 5 year old hanging about in that, so we decided to go back to the hotel- that was the end of our evening. We heard late that night they did reopen it, but by then it was no good for us. I understand they had no option, but it felt like a waste of an evening ( and a waste of drinks we left behind) Sunday evening the granddaughter didn't want to watch Cirque de hilarious as she was totally taken with her dance academy experience and wanted to watch the skyline gang farewell show in the pavillion, so we didn't use the B-line passes. Had we wanted to they probably would have been worth it as the queues looked very long. So it's a bit hit and miss. I'm not going to say they are a waste of money, just have a think about what you are wanting from them- if its front row seats with minimum queuing and hassle, they are a good buy- if you will be going each night. For us they worked out expensive as Saturday night they weren't beneficial at all and Sunday we didn't use them.
The quality of the productions is really high. The stage sets and props etc are fab for Sleeping Beauty and Paddington. The Redcoats are also friendly and really talkative with the kids. Across the whole resort we never had a bad interaction with any staff.
Food wise, I'd throughly recommend the Pub & Kitchen. My husbands ribeye was as good as ones he has had at pricey steakhouses and reasonably priced too. For any of the restaurants I'd recommend you book if you want a popular time, like 6-7, otherwise you will be told there is a 45 min wait.
Overall it was a good weekend and the fact our granddaughter was unbelievably sad she was leaving this morning shows it was a winner. I feel Butlins is a rite of passage- I was taken as a kid each year, we took our kids and now we are back with our grandchild. Even if the hi-de-hi experience fills you with dread- give it a go. Maybe try the hotels as it's a different kind of experience and now I'm older definitely my preferred choice. I would have given it 5 stars if it hadn't been for the niggling issues.

Service was careless and sloppy with the food taking an age to arrive, and the order incomplete when it did come - although I got to enjoy a bellowed conversation between staff taking place about 8 inches from my left ear while I waited. Previously we’ve enjoyed juicy, succulent burgers here but on this occasion they were dry, so much so I sent my rooster burger back. Replacement offered but declined as I feared waiting another eternity. The battered sausage from the local chippy filled the gap (can recommend, a fraction of the price too).

Yesterday I was sadly disappointed. The lovely big pond next to the reception centre is being ""re-developed"" (I dread to think what that will turn out to be - from the little info given it looks alarmimgly commercial rather than preservational).

On the plus side the reed beds, newly trimmed, looked wonderful in the low winter sunlight and while the new boardwalk surfaces with built-in anti slip are noisier they do look to wear better than the previous chicken-wire solution.

I would like to apologise to the surly girl in the cafe whose kitchen gossip was interrupted by my presence - never mind lass, I paid by card so you didn't have the extra burden of working out change and could quickly return to the kitchen for more chat.

Thank goodness for the reception/shop staff whose friendly service on entry and on exit shone through brightly.

2036,Church Farm,Accommodation,Littlehampton,AccomOther,0,"Dirty Prestige caravan, our fears realised","We haven't stayed at a Haven site for many years but have happy memories of the fun our own and friends children had at the Combe Haven and Lower Hyde parks (the latter no longer a Haven park)
Unfortunately these visits were often spoilt for the adults of our groups by poor cleaning standards. It’s not right but 'you' come to expect to carry out a certain level of cleaning yourself. I see other reviewers have a similar opinion. A sad situation for customers to endure for the sake of providing an enjoyable family holiday for the younger members.
Our recent visit, the first for many years to a Haven site was to Church Farm Pagham where our worst fears were realised. We booked in July, too late to hire a newer model unlike the friends we planned to meet who had managed to do so.
A newer caravan was something that had become a must for us many years ago just in order to stand a better chance of a nicer, cleaner caravan, so we were optimistic but apprehensive.
Initial impressions of the site were good although we did not stay long enough to see exactly how good the facilities were.
We'd hired a Prestige with decking, and were able to book in early at about 1300 which was a plus.
First impression of the outside of the caravan wasn't great especially as the steps to the decking looked like they had become partly detached, this remained to be seen but in the end events negated the need to confirm this.
As the fridge-freezer is close to the side door it was the first item checked and to our surprise it was very clean, from there on it went steeply downhill.
Dirty or sticky cup marks on coffee table, (not burns that couldn’t have been wiped off). Food remnants on work-tops, cutlery / crockery drainer and washing-up bowl.
Kitchen cabinet door handles sticky and greasy. Edging missing from work-top . Floors not properly swept or vacuumed. Crumbs under stained, drab, dowdy soft furnishings that we certainly didn't relish sitting or laying on. The table and chairs ; you could get better and cleaner from your local charity / second hand shop.
Bottom of net curtains in all rooms appeared stained (brownish) from condensation possibly.
Our fears realised ; and any optimism gone I phoned the site office to ask if there were any chance of an up-grade (at our expense) possibly to a newer model. Unfortunately nothing was available and the only solution that could be offered was a cleaning team to clean again.
In our view it would have taken many hours to bring the caravan up to an acceptable standard so this was not a viable option. (Ideally it also needed an upholsterer and a carpet fitter) . We realised we had no choice but return home…….120 miles , so not a decision made lightly especially as our friends would be expecting us later that day.
The staff were polite and apologetic but this doesn't alter the fact that they were unable to provide a suitable solution especially when there were only two of us.
We were told we would get a full refund but this would take up to seven days.
Not having the greatest confidence in Haven I waited a day to check what progress had been made with the refund. In short nothing had been done. Again staff were polite and apologetic and I’m told this is now in hand: I shall have to see what happens next.
It's obviously more cost effective to loose a customer and give a refund than put the problem right. Putting the problem right may involve paying more for better cleaners, giving them more time, supervising them effectively, replacing old or worn items of furniture curtains cushions etc. etc. so I guess nothing will change.
I have scored 2 of 5 only because the site seemed ok. The caravan itself didn't really justify a 1.

2038,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,7,Mixed Feelings on Butlins,"We spent a four night break. First the good points, we are exhausted on our return! The days were busy, booked a few activities, splash pool was great, we went everyday. Funfair good, evening shows, circus good. Would recommend going early to the pool as it gets extremely packed and queues for rides can be 50 mins wait. Also the changing room gets very dirty after 11am!

Bad points, cleanliness of apartment awful. Kitchen cupboards dirty, utensils had food on them probably from last guests, kitchen floor sticky, dustpan and broom filthy with dirt and hair. I had to buy my own at local supermarket. Bathroom radiators so dusty, had to wipe down before putting our towels on them. Kids would not sit on the carpet after seeing dirt underneath sofa, no furniture moved for hoovering. It was a new style silver, but though it looked modern, look closer and things have not been maintained or cleaned so have built up dirt. Bring your own pots, pans,
and cutlery ones provided were old and beaten up. Considering we were a family of five, they only gave us cutlery for four.
The entertainment venues also need a good cleaning, floors were sticky and ventilation was awful, no air, horrible stale smell in Centre Stage and Reds venue. They need to clean in between shows, if you go to a later show you have to sit amongst, rubbish, spilt drinks, sticky floors from previous show. The arcades are a waste of money, kids go crazy trying to get as many tickets as possible, you will trade them in for rubbish. Will not be going back to Butlins, definitely not Bognor. Maybe the cleaning in the hotel rooms might be better, but cleaning should be to a certain standard in all accomodation, no matter what level.

Having seen some photos of views of the hotel roof I called the hotel directly, prior to staying, to ensure it didn’t have this so was disappointed to find the side view was just that!
The front view, however, was much nicer.
Friendly staff and quick check in.
Rooms were all clean and daily housekeeping was good. Worth noting they don’t put dishwasher on like the do at Center Parcs, not a big deal though, easy to manage! 😀
The room is spacious with good air con/heating and comfortable beds.
On the down side there are no heated towel rails which are useful for drying swimwear.
Neither of the DVD players in the kids bunks worked and reception were not interested when this was reported. Apparently the DVD players are not being replaced, my thoughts are that they shouldn’t advertise them if they are not maintaining them as leads to disappointed children. My little one had spent ages choosing ones she wanted to watch in bed. (For the novelty).
The showers were good but water not really warm enough, if, like me, you like a hot bath or shower rather than just warm.
The cafe in the hotel is really good for lunch in a nice chilled setting. The staff were so accommodating of dietary needs and made be a bespoke meal to be gluten free but include halloumi. (The rest of the site not so accommodating)
Nice coffee too 👍

2050,Premier Inn Bognor,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,133,Good location very clean does what it says on the tin! ,"Visited here as a couple attending Goodwood.
The location is superb and parking onsite is excellent. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was just as you would expect. It was spotlessly clean with tea/coffee facilities and basic toiletries. The bed was comfortable and we slept well. The only thing that lets this hotel down is the pub next door. Staff there are also friendly and locals use it too. However in my opinion the menu could be a lot better with lighter snacks offered such as a sandwich choice or lighter plates. Hence we did not eat here. We did have breakfast on our second day before we left. The timings of breakfast were not entirely reflective of events in the area to allow guests to enjoy a meal prior to driving to Goodwood. If you compare prices on non event weeks at Goodwood with the days when there are special events then you will see at least a gigantic increase in the rates! Surely at these prices a breakfast should be included and served at times to suit these guests. When they say breakfast is at 8am then it’s 8am on the dot and not everything is actually out and ready. The cooked English was good. The conveyor belt for toast was the usual - not set entirely right and if you put your bread in twice it was then over done! Croissants were very heavy and doughy!
So a few things to bear in mind here.

2066,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,0,Disappointing,"I'm writing this review on the day of check out (not that we know where as the reception near us is always closed)
We had a silver room in dolphin boulevard which did not match the pictures. We didn't even get a double bed. Upon our arrival  (after waiting 3 hours for the room to be ""cleaned"") we noticed the beds had been made but that's it. An empty box of alcohol had been left under one of the beds the teaspoon was disgustingly filthy. I had to clean the bedside table and the storage unit for clothes so our stuff wouldn't get dirty and ruined, not what you expect to do on holiday. The bathroom was very small and the toilet seat not stable so we've both fallen off of it. Both of us have bruises from catching ourselves on the sink aswell. TV constantly glitches and loses sound. Walls very thin so could here next door snore. There was a light placed right outside our door so due to glass panels that light lit up the room the whole night... causing a lack of sleep  (again not what you pay to go on holiday for) nobody is policing the smoking rules so our neighbours decided to stand outside our room to smoke. My main complaint with the room is it made us feel ill. If we were in the room we got headaches and felt sick but when we were anywhere else we were fine. Not sure if there's some kind of leak in here. Also the carpet has some kind of bugs in it as I kept being bitten and if you sat on floor I unpack or tie shoes you'd become all itchy instantly. Due to this we had considered leaving early but felt to unwell to do so.

Splash is nice if you've got kids but for two adults it's a bit pointless can't do widths or lengths as always to many people. There's a toddler and parent hour so maybe a adult only hour or a aqua aerobics class would be good. The changing rooms are very slippy and dirty couldn't feel the underfloor heating either.

There was an incident Tuesday night near our apartment. So the next day we all got a knock at the door and handed a letter to explain. Massive waste of paper but nice of them to try make us feel safe.

The rest of the resort was nice lots for kids to do (not for two adults though). Lots of food places but all seem expensive for what you get would be cheaper to eat off resort. Supermarket is handy but again expensive they add money to the essentials. Didn't really interact with too many staff buy those we did seemed friendly.

All said we didn't enjoy it feel we wasted our money and will now have to have doctors checks to try figure out what was wrong with our room.
We wouldn't come again until we have children and would not stay in the silver room again ever.

Roast potatoes were obviously from the freezer as were the Yorkshire puddings and they have then microwaved to death along with the rest of the meals.

2069,LG Café,Food,Arundel, Café,1,Children not their 'target demographic',"I visited here with my friend and 16 month old daughter for lunch today. The waitress was very friendly but the service of what I assume is the owner was like nothing I have ever experienced. Having no childrens menu I asked if I could have just a single pancake with some banana and maple syrup for my child. The waitress came back and said that pancakes only come in stacks of three. I said well can you separate one of my pancakes as I am having nutella and my daughter doesnt like it. I then talked to who I assume are the owners and was told the menu is non-customisable. I brought up the fact that there is no childrens menu and was told that 'children are not in their target demographic' (even though the place looks like the inside of willy wonkers chocolate factory). After much toing and froing they finally agreed to give me the toppings separately from the pancakes so I could do it myself but was advised they would only do it 'just this once' and next time I would have to have exactly on the menu! The whole thing was frankly bizarre and as a local safe to say I shall not be returning, but as I'm not in their demographic I imagine they wont care anyway!",1,4.0,0.0,British,1

I will not be staying here again. The photos on the website must have been taken years ago. The whole place looks scuffed and tired, and desperately needs a coat of paint. We booked for a family Christmas get together and were expecting to enjoy a festive meal with an overnight stay and breakfast.

Our room was what I would expect to get in a 2 star hotel, it looked small and dingy, the over bath shower was weak with a variable temperature, and paint was peeling on the window frames. It was certainly overpriced for we got.

When we went for dinner we could see that the dining room and the tables were decorated for Christmas, however we were shown to what would normally be a conference room with bright lighting and no atmosphere. There were no decorations and the staff hastily laid up one of the conference tables for us. I couldn’t believe that we were expected to eat there! When we raised this the staff managed to find us 6 Xmas crackers and said that the groups in the dining room had all pre-booked their parties - which was exactly what we had done. We were not offered a festive menu and their regular menu is limited and dull. The food itself was cheap quality and clearly not made from scratch on the premises.

The buffet breakfast was plentiful, but again low quality and the coffee is rubbish.

2081,Ocean Hotel & Spa,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,0,Could do a lot better,"Hi
Just back from a weeks holiday at Butlins Bognor regis wish i had gone to Skegness.
Lets start with the ocean hotel two tiny lifts that are not adequate for the number of guests. Sometimes waiting 10 to 15 minutes to get in, over the weekend one of the lifts was out of order for 3 days. The room (411) dirty with hairs all over bathroom, carpets stained, luckily on complaint this was rectified quite quickly. We had hotel dining plan, avoid get dine around instead. the buffet consisted of a set menu every night only changing the meat option. My wife is a veggie this choice was almost non existent resorting to cheese and biscuits on third night luckily on complaint we were up graded free to the dine around option. Has any one from butlins been to lego land and seen a proper buffet? .
The pub and kitchen what a joke 25 minutes wait for dessert when mentioned to waitress she came out with lame excuse that the printer was,nt working in the kitchen
she should have realised no desserts were coming out and chased this, the dessert chef must have thought it was his lucky night being so quiet ., but worst of all the manager did,nt know what was going on. We had some side orders to pay for she got that bill wrong when rectified she could'nt work out the change £6 from £10 she had to be told by her manager.
Don,t bother queuing for rides just push in the ride operators won,t stop you.Their good at telling little ones they are to small but won,t say anything to queue jumpers (cowards). The same in the pool.
Now for the worst bit the pool is far to small for the size of the complex you are not allowed to ride the slides with your children having to stand around waiting. The cafe is separate so my non swimming wife had to sit on her own while we in the pool (thank god for costa).You cant get a drink in the pool area and chill out. The rapids are dangerous when you get to the bottom the water channels you in to the corner where there is a handrail waiting to catch the unwary. My son
 banged his head another gentleman split his forehead open and a young lad had some teeth knocked out .
There are numerous other niggles i could go into but i wont.
Overall we had a good holiday making the best of a bad week. my son enjoyed himself, the shows were funny, but we wont be going back to any butlins very quickly if ever. next year i,ll chance Disneyland Paris.

2085,Domino's Pizza,Food,Littlehampton, Fast Food/Takeaway,168,Poor Customer Service & Liars ,"I pre-ordered via the Domino’s app 1hour15 minutes before delivery time. All was in order, the app displayed the pizza was in the oven and then out for delivery. I tracked the order, the driver was supposed to be outside. I went outside, no delivery driver. I waited ten minutes, checked the app again “your pizza has arrived / enjoy your food”. I called the branch. ‘The driver is in reception waiting for you, he’s tried to call but there’s been no answer’. I explained that my phone hadn’t rung, nor was I staying in a hotel with a reception. I was however in a holiday cottage and the address came up on the app when I put in the postcode. The store said they’d have our order with me shortly. I said that I didn’t want the order that had already been sent as it’d be stone cold. Good enough the store said they would cook fresh and re-send. An hour on from my preferred delivery time I called the branch again and spoke to someone else this time. The guy said the order was on its way. How long I asked as I had already been waiting almost an hour on from the original delivery time. The response was vague. I asked if they would take some money off our order due to the mess around. The guy on the phone put me on hold to check with his manager. After a VERY short wait, I was told no, because the driver tried to call me and there was no answer, they’d be no discount. The so called attempt to contact me was a blatant lie. My phone had a signal and maintained such for the two occasions I spoke to the branch. The order arrived a few minutes after the call. I was keen to send it back without payment, my husband however, decided to accept it and pay for it, with a tip! The driver that brought the redelivery said his colleague messed up, went to the wrong address and he knew our location as he’d delivered there before. The food was barely hot, thankfully I had the oven ticking over for an hour (just in case) so warmed it to an edible temperature.

I would also like to add that the branch was just over two miles away so it wasn’t as if we were in the back of beyond. Appalling customer service. I wouldn’t order from here again if you paid ME.

Thankfully my local branch of Domino’s is super reliable. Littlehampton could learn a thing or two from them and from your competitor; Pizza Hut for that matter, even they have a Speed Guarantee.

I read that the rooms were of a poor standard, however renovation was being done, so I rang and requested a newly decorated room, this was ok but nothing special and obviously a makeover doesnt extend to flaking paint on window frames, wasnt impressed with the cleaning of the room, lots of cobwebs that had obviously been there some time.
The hotel needs a major overhaul, the paintwork, decoration and carpets in most areas is apalling. The creakibg floor boards in the corridors were awful, how the people staying in those rooms got any rest is beyond me!
Price of drinks is quite expensive. We ordered two cocktails and when the waitress bought them over, she spilt most of one on the table and down my husbands trousers, she never even came back to clean the table, and we had to ask for it to be cleaned.
Food was quite good, not much choice on the menu for a Saturday evening though.

So we made a reservation and returned 45 minutes later and was sat straight down and was told waitress would be over shortly. 10 minutes later we had to ask the manager if we could order drinks as no one had been over! We waited nearly another 10 minutes for the bar maid to come over and say they didn't have the wine I ordered. Our food order was taken and we asked for starters first. Went with the music wheel for my partner, 2 year old and I to share. It was really disappointing for such a long wait. Half an hour went by with staff sweeping the floor and cleaning empty tables around us when our plates hadn't been cleared. We heard the people around us complaining about the wait. It wasn't busy at this point so there was no excuse. It was getting closer to 7 o'clock and the table behind us obviously wanted to get the the show and had to ask for their dessert to go. My partner had to go up to the bar to ask our waitress for another drink. She never passed the order to the bar maid so he had to go up again. Our waitress walked past and we had to ask her to clear the table. It was like we had asked her to lick the table not just move the empty plates that had been there half an hour. Our 2 year old after being strapped in to a high chair for an hour was getting really tetchy so we had to ask for our food to be taken away.
It really ruined our night because we actually looked forward to trying the diner and actually spent the most money here out of all the other places. The food was also really poor considering we were only waiting for hot dog and chips. My partner had the chilli dog which had basically no chilli on it. The bread rolls were dry and split. We ordered extra coleslaw at about £2.50. The waitress failed to mention both our meals came with coleslaw so we didn't actually need it. When the bill came they tried to charge me for the more expensive wine I ordered thay they didn't have! We complained to the manager on the way out about the poor service and we may as well not have bothered. Her response was 'I don't know what's happened there.'

2105,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,10,Total let down.,"We have been visiting Butlins Skegness as a family for many years now and decided to try Bognor as a change for 2019. This was a mistake on our part. This is the holiday of ""No you can't."" The water park was much smaller than we imagined after it's billing. Once inside some of the slides have a manufacturer recommendation of no under 18s. So a 6 foot 2 17 year old lad at 15 stone is ok, but a 5 foot lady of 40 is barred? Makes sense. Never seen a slide with that disclaimer. Rammed beyond belief, our two young children bumped and bashed over constantly. The rooms were not as clean as expected and for self catering we were used to having basic things such as the fridge being switched on ready so we could put our food in, especially in hot weather and a tin opener. Shame this Butlins didn't consider that. The forks had thick black residue on the sides of the prongs. Horrible. TV didn't work for full duration. The whole place has been packed like sardines. Way too many people here. Intimidating when you are only three and in a huge crowded area for a show. Plus no account for disabilities. My wife had only standing room for one event. Red Coats just stare blankly when asked for help or reasons. The amount of smokers walking around and not in the smoking areas in a family park was surprising. I could go on, kids being refused autographs as they has bought the ""wrong"" merchandise (over double the price) of the goods that were allowed was really the last straw. Particular mention to Braydon here who gave some nonsense about the type of pen being used until I told him I work with autographs and then admitted he didn't really know why and walked off when I told him what a poor time we were having in general. We won't be back, a real shame as this was a celebration of a family members return to health after a horrendous 18 months. Gandeys Circus was good, except for that the children's foam hands were stolen from under their seats. Will be looking forward to going home. If we are to make it back to Butlins, it won't be here.

2113,Ocean Hotel & Spa,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,19,Nye 2019,"We stayed in the ocean hotel, 3 adults 1 child.
We opted to have breakfast in the hotel and this was very nice, we’re looking to return this year and are wanting the book the dining package to eat in the hotel for breakfast and tea. I would defiantly recommend at least breakfast.

The resort looks very up-to date compared to minehead and Skegness. The funfair was very good as the rides are included, however I do think the go karts should be included as they were years before. The hall of mirrors and magic tricks area was very good for photos and a walk around.

We didn’t visit the swim pool as we booked to go to the spa instead however we are looking to return to be able to visit the new pool and the old pool does look dated and small.

We dined our at most of the restaurants while we were there, the diner was very reasonable and probably the best restaurant we went to, we had the buffet at papa johns this did work out quite expensive around £60 for the 4 of us

We did que to get a table nye for reds however we wanted to watch some of the entertainment that night in centre stage as we got seats and this was around 7 and there were plenty left.
Every other night we went to the venues and there were no problems getting seats. Previous years at Skegness and minehead we have had to sue every night for seats

For nye we celebrated this in reds but we’re a bit disappointed that they had no cannons at midnight or the London countdown like they do at Skegness.

I would defiantly recommend the ocean hotel and this is very different to our other visits in apartments, we would defiantly return in a hotel and to Bognor Regis.",5,1.0,2.0,0,0

2128,Norfolk Arms,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,21,Possibly my worst roast dinner..?,"It was Easter Sunday around 3pm and we were hungry. We saw the Norfolk Arms was advertising roast dinners and, although it was fairly expensive, decided to give it a try. I went to the Norfolk Tap bar to order two roast beef dinners and one pork, and bought some drinks, including a lovely Tarrant Street IPA. When our food arrived, the pork roast had some apple sauce included, but we had to ask for horseradish sauce to go with the beef. It arrived quickly, but without a serving spoon.
Although mum-in-law's pork was OK, our beef was dry and overcooked. The roast potatoes were hard, dry and leathery and the Yorkshire pudding hard and dry as a bone. The parsnips were almost raw and inedible. This was food that had been standing a LONG time. I don’t tolerate bad food and, had we had a check-back, I would have voiced our dissatisfaction. However, none was forthcoming and, as the kitchen was a long way away and it was now after 3 o'clock, we thought we'd have to get on with it or go hungry.
This was one of the most expensive roast dinners I have had, but it was also one of the worst, only one I foolishly ordered from a Wetherspoons being worse.
If you can't keep food warm satisfactorily, then don’t sell it. My wife is a chef and knows how to keep food warm without spoiling and NOT to serve food that is no longer fit for eating. We’re local and will never come back, but it would be nice if other customers didn't have to endure such poor standards.

Then we sat down ordered our drinks and poppadoms but on the table was a 5 course set menu for £22.95 per head which is all good if you can eat 5 courses and dont have kids with you.

We asked if we could order from the main menu and the guy told us that we could choose items off the menu and pay for what we have only this changed when we was about to order. They told us we could only have the 5 courses! There was no mention of this when I called and the staff were extremely rude and obnoxious. We paid up what we had and left.
We weren't the only ones. The table of 6 next to us were also Ill informed. They got told that the menu would be £14.95 per head. What a joke. I think they were about to walk too.
We should have learned from our last experience of our takeaway from the Anohka, West Meads. We had to wait an hour and a half for cold food.
They will never have us as customers again.
So disappointed.

2137,Norfolk Arms,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,157,Nice hotel in the heart of Arundel.,"We stayed for 3 nights here, two nights as part of a dinner on the first night package and one other night. We booked here as we wanted to explore East Sussex and Arundel and it was the ideal base.
Initial booking enquiries were a little frustrating but we eventually got a good deal which we thought was very good value for money.
Parking is charged at £5 per night (2 of our nights were included in the dinner package). Parking is ample and secure with barrier / code access. Parking provision / security is always important to use when booking accommodation for breaks in the Uk.
The hotel itself is ideal for Arundel castle and is in the main high street. Our room was very nice and clean and looked like it had been refurbished (room 1). It can get a little noisy in this room on a weekend as there are a couple of pubs in the vicinity.
Our dinner on the first night was very good and service was excellent. There was no embarrassment about how the dinner package worked. The waiter (French chap) knew exactly what deal we were on and explained what we could have with no fuss at all.
We could choose 2 of pretty much any starter / main or desert on the menu. I had squid for starters and fish and chips, both of which were top notch. My wife had pate and Pork belly – both of which were great. 2 glasses of prosecco were also included in the deal.
The room itself was large, light and airy. Bathroom suite was very good and TV was an adequate size.
I always have trouble sleeping in a bed other than my own but suffice to say it was no better / worse than other hotel beds I have slept in.
Breakfast could have been a little better as the room felt a little small for the amount of guests that were staying with a little less personal space than I would have liked.
Food was good – the English breakfast was very good especially the Cumberland sausage. I would suggest that these would be better served on smaller plates as there was plenty of food but it didn’t look like it.
Staff were friendly throughout and we had no issues at all to complain about.
All in all a good stay in what was very good value for money compared with other hotels in the area.

A couple of suggestions would be to boost the wi-if as it was patchy at times, and as the football is so popular maybe an organised game at a certain time every day on the pitch would be a good idea?

One couple wanted onion bhajis for starter. We still hadn't the drinks previously ordered, I had to go to the bar and remind them and wait. Not ideal. However starter arrived and obviously there was a wait in between no an issue. Then two vegan meals came out with out rice but the girls started to eat as hungry. We waited and waited and eventually a prawn curry x 2 arrived still no rice or naan bread The curry was congealed around the edge implying that it had been microwaved, and hubbie was looking through and could only find 4 prawns not a lot between 2 of us. To this time others had still not received their meals then the sides came out in drips and drabs and the rice still hadn't arrived!! You can imagine by this time we were very disappointed a birthday celebration that it was supposed to be, degenerated into a farce. My son got extremely cross as did my husband and we complained fiercely. By this time we were so disgusted with the meal and the terrible service and fact it hadn't come on time or was hot we did not wish to continue . The manager Michael came out and apologized but did not offer for me to be replaced he then disappeared. Needless to say this all ruined our experience and we had felt embarrassed as we had recommended the restaurant to our family.

Wallpaper was stained and peeling off the walls.

Skirting boards were cracked and coming away from the walls.

Ceiling in the room was showing cracks and starting to bow.

Ceiling and walls in the bathroom were covered in damp patches and the paint was flaking off.

Dead flies on window sill and all edges of the window the sealant was cracked and covered in grime.

For the price I paid this is honestly the worst Hotel I have ever stayed in and the Hilton should be ashamed to be charging people to stay in such a shocking environment.

The splash world facility was well thought of, plenty of lockers, free use of hair dryers and they also provide spinners to dry your swimming costumes. Butlins is good value for money as they have indoor and outdoor fairgrounds, daimy time and evening entertainment included. We also really liked the new Discover Animal display they added. Again new from the weekend we areived. Plenty to do with the family. We also really like Bognor Regis the town.

Sam on reception was brilliant, and his manager I think also a Sam was great. The groundsmen work extremely hard, the whole place is spotless and very nicely maintained. The entertainment was great for the kids despite being school term. The swimming pool was very good, one gripe was dirty nappies left by some disrespectful humans with no morals in the shower, but overall the lifeguards were fab, especially the young lad in the green top who does the inflatable disco on Thursday. The mash and barrel staff were good but the food was awful and a waste of £50. The arcades were good, a girl named Charley was simply amazing with our little ones and such a nice friendly girl. Security was spot on, again friendly and helpful people, chip shop was nice and reasonable prices. Upon check out, Ray was standing at the entrance in the most treacherous rain for people to hand their caravan keys to him to save them getting wet, what a credit to haven he is.

The menu is a nice balance between interesting fine dining options and pub staples like fish and chips and the burger.

Drinks orders were taken swiftly, but maybe not too observantly, as my wife and mother-in-law were the bemused recipients of pints of Amstel and Peroni respectively

However the food arrived swiftly and what food it was; my pork belly was superb, and the girls’ fish and chips were by common consensus maybe the best ever, with wonderful light crispy batter verging on the Tempura, and chunky chips with just the right balance of crispy outside and floury inside.

Perhaps understandably, the ladies were a little full after their mains and pints of lager, so we passed on the desserts.

However the meal was the worst meal I have ever eaten - a platter of seafood - whitebait, scampi, calamari and ‘fish balls’.
Without thinking too deeply about it I ordered it with chips as well.

What arrived was a large plate of the items described and everything battered and fried plus a serving of very tired looking fried chips.
The mass of fried and battered items looked awful, was not that nice to eat and I left most fearing heartburn, indigestion and an upset stomach besides a calorie intake that should raise alarm bells.

Ok I was stupid ordering a completely ridiculous fried selection and badly balanced meal but it begs the question why was it on the menu in the first place?

I noted the remains of other similar ‘platters’ being left by other customers.

On the desert menu no ice cream as the machine was broken the staff do what they can but I believe that this restaurant is poorly managed tables full of crockery and the toilets need monitoring.

2254,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,25,February half term fabulous fun!,"Back again (how we can stay away eh?)!

We stayed in the Ocean Hotel, it looking as clean as it was when it first opened. Freddie at Reception treated us as though we were the only guests he'd met all day - so polite, jolly, taking such great interest in my boys - what a great start!
In fact, every member of staff we spoke to went well out of their way to help us / make us feel at ease, as per our requests. And of course, the legend known as Ritchie....! Thanks Ritchie for the advice you gave my boys, and not just about football either.

With the new dining system we were able to eat in a variety of locations, for both breakfast and dinner (we were too full to eat lunch!) - this gave our stay such variation, no day was in no way the same. And as for the choice of food - I think The Deck came out top favourite, but that along with the Ocean Hotel restaurant and Papa Johns too. Another thing I find that people overlook is the 'background' music playing whilst we ate - it was such an eclectic mix, tunes for everyone, so giving the great age range of our group songs to sing along too whilst we ate, so adding to our fun (I wasn't the worst singer btw!).

My eldest son (genuinely!) beat me for the first time ever on the go-karts - at least I had the ice cream from the 'pink cows shop' (so funny) brought for me this year by the chuffed victor!

We must return to experience the much-anticipated new leisure pool - that's going to enhance our stay so much more.

Thank you Butlins - you've again managed to give my family and I such an amazing experience / stay / holiday / total rest.

First the guy serving Mr personanaly, not even a hello good morning so I cheerfully said good morning, I got a good morning back, amazing, I'm coming to spend money in your pub.
Went to get 2 coffees from the coffee jug only enough for 1 left in jug, went to inform same guy said he would would bring a refill out, meanwhile my other cup left on the bar, after 5 min noticed the jug had been refilled, we were sitting next to the bar, went to the bar to ask for the other cup, felt embarrassed to ask the 2 staff standing with backs to the bar as they were eating the breakfast filled baps, had to ask for my cup in the end.
The breakfast came not what I had asked for the vegetarian should have been sizzling, politely said this to same guy, he did offer to change this said no its OK.
The breakfasts were all luke warm the sausages were white, the eggs were lovely, could not be bothered to complain again.
As we left my wife said goodbye no response.
I do hope the Rd reads this, we are happy cheerfully people left this pub feeling deflated.
Perhaps training is needed, I can give a list of pubs where the experience is fantastic.

2265,Knights Table Steakhouse,Food,Arundel, Steakhouse/Diner,32,Very Poor Carvery,"We went to the Knights Table for a family birthday lunch on Sunday. After reading the many excellent reviews we were really looking forward to a lovely meal in a relatively new restaurant in Arundel.

Unfortunately our experience didn’t match the reviews.

After ordering the carvery for all of us we were told by the waitress that there would be a little wait, about ten minutes, while the carvery was ‘freshened up’.

However when we reached the carvery we were greeted with beef that had literally been seared on the outside and was raw and very bloody, 2 chicken pieces that were so pale they also didn’t look cooked and gammon that was over cooked and incredibly fatty. With the benefit of hindsight we should have refused the carvery and ordered something else but stupidly not wishing to make a fuss we carried on with it. In reality the food should never have been offered to us. There were little veg, the carrots had almost run out, the Yorkshire puddings were cold and tasted like cardboard and the roast potatoes inedible.

Interestingly, soon after we had been served, the carvery food was cleared and replaced. Perhaps we chose the wrong time to eat but again we should never have been served such poor food.

When the waitress cleared our plates, saw how we had left most of our food and asked how our food was she said ‘thank you for being honest and we welcome feedback positive or negative’ but with respect these are clearly just words.

Oh and for the record my husband would only have given a one star, not two as I have.

Whilst the decor is quite quirky, the hard wooden bench seats we were given were quite uncomfortable.

Unfortunately, we will not be returning to the Knights Table which is a shame as we do like to support local businesses.

Saying that, our room was spacious and clean and we had a good night sleep. The outdoor pool was a fantastic bonus and was heated to 30 degrees so perfect for my toddler. The inside pool was also lovely and warm. We ate dinner in the bar, which was good and there was also a good breakfast served the following morning in the restaurant. The staff at the hotel are outstanding. Everyone we met were so friendly and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. It was a lovely night away, I would definitely recommend this hotel.

Accommodation was good, food was reasonable, staff were excellent. The only let down was the behaviour of some of the other guests we obviously thought the break was an excuse to get completely pissed, abdicate all parental responsibility and crash around, shouting outside in the early hours.

Of course I would not wear in the pool - neither would I consider it to be outdoor wear. I would not wear to work or drive in my car - it is beach/pool wear.
Twice I was asked by young male pool attendants to remove this dress, as in their words it was 'outdoor clothes'. Despite showing that I had my costume underneath, they were insistent.

2293,Church Farm,Accommodation,Littlehampton,AccomOther,95,Short Family Break,"4 nights spent at Church Farm, with 2 youngsters and the dog. Booked via the ‘Sun’ holiday promotion. Our stay was the week before the start of the school holidays so the park was reasonably quite.

We benefited from upgrading to a prestige van with 3 bedrooms, which was 2 years old. On arrival it was clean, tidy and well fitted out. Benefited from bedding, appliances etc in a quite location. Perfect for the family.

The park has a great entertainment area with evening shows, arcade and both indoor and outdoor pools. Although the pools aren’t large they are in good condition with a slide. Not sure how they will be in peak session / school holidays esp as changing areas are limited.

The mini market caters for your everyday needs. The shows were entertaining and as a family we enjoyed watching each night.

The only downside of the holiday was the pub / restaurant. Although open all day the quality and organisation was poor. Ordered breakfast (hardly any other customers present) and had to wait over 40 mins. When food arrived it was wrong and had to be sent back. Another long wait before it finally came by which time we had spent an hour waiting and had 2 hungry kids. No apology, no discount, just a shrug of shoulders....... and over £20 which could have been spent elsewhere!

Daughters side order turned up after 3 requests but they had put warm sweet corn (that she hadn’t ordered) and warm garlic bread on top of cucumber which she then wouldn’t eat as it was v unpleasant...
Floor manager explanation was that quite often people order starters and mains to come together - really?! Why would this be presumed?! Wasn’t v apologetic. Then agreed to take 20% off bill.

The indoor swimming pool had dirty water and floor around it and it hadn’t even the soap in the ( not illuminated) shower.
In the room there were cables and missed switches, one bed lamp was broken and not working.
In the night we were waked up by the fire alarm ( as all the hotel guests) due - they told us - to an alarm in one room ( or by a mis-contact as we suppose). Then at 6 in the morning it was noisily inserted a apology letter under the door, waking us up again.
We have chosen Hilton and not one of the ( many) other hotels because we supposed to have the grant of quality but we were totally wrong. We just paid a 4 star hotel price (270 pound for one night!) to sleep one night in a old, neglected, stinky hotel.

So cheap - £3.50 on a week day, £4.50 at the weekend.

It looks run down and grubby from the outside but it’s not like that inside.

The staff are always friendly, the food and drink are cheap.

The cinema is like an old theatre, the main screen makes you feel like you are going back in time. The other screens downstairs have been revamped recently and look great.

I love this cinema and it’s such great value, since discovering it a few years ago, I really go anywhere else!

My first suggestion would be to inform people as their seated what dishes you don’t have, rather than wait for them to decide to order and then let them know then. As not having crab (my first choice) and then another fish dish (my second choice)..
Other tables spent a while deciding as did we to then be told you didn’t have the dishes.
Also I really have to say that serving scallops on a piece of brioche is bizarre, so so sickly as was the over bearing sweet jam with so much ginger in. Just a really disappointing dish for £11!
The roast dinners could have been alright if the beef wasn’t overcooked and hadn’t been swamped in the ridiculous amount of almost jelly like gravy, also couldn’t make out what the white sauce was on the plate initially I thought horseradish or bread sauce but it literally was just a tasteless white sauce floating in the gravy.

2369,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,25,"Nice break, shame about the accommodation...","We booked our 3 night stay from 27-30 December as a post-Christmas treat for the family (2 adults, 2 kids, 4 and 5.5 years old).

We’d never been to Butlins before so weren’t really sure what to expect and had read reviews which were either really good or terrible, so just decided to book and make up our own minds – plus it was cheaper at this time of year than our usual choices of either Haven or Centreparcs.

First impressions weren’t good –we arrived and parked in the car park to discover that our ‘apartment’ was the furthest distance away of all the accommodation. Bearing in mind that people in the apartments are obviously self-catering, and will therefore have a ton of stuff to haul to the room, you’d think they’d make some parking available nearer that part of the resort (or at least some temporary parking so you can offload nearer to your room). So, we had to do 2 trips back and forth from one side of the resort to the other, balancing our stuff on the airport-style trollies which had been left scattered around the car park. Not the most relaxing start to the weekend.

The ‘standard apartment’ should maybe get a name change to ‘basic apartment’ as that would more accurately describe it. We made our way to the apartment, located in what I can only describe as rows of very dated apartment buildings, almost prison-like in their style, complete with paint peeling off the outer walls, doors etc. Having got past the other apartments and their new owners for the weekend, most of whom were busily smoking away in the doorways (there are designated smoking areas on the site but these were mostly ignored going by what we saw over the 3 days we were there). We got into the ‘apartment’ (which is pushing it really – ‘bedsit’ might be a better description) and were hit immediately by the smell of tobacco smoke and, in the kids room, the unmistakable smell of weed. The grill in the cooker was partly broken and was hanging down into the oven and there was mildew/mould on the crumbling window sills. No towels were provided (although we already knew this, but it’s still a basic thing that’s provided in most resorts these days). A complaint was made and the grill was eventually fixed although it was only my wife’s decision to bring a scented candle with us that helped with the smell of the place.

The apartment itself is basic, with the usual things you need (plates, cups, cutlery, tea/coffee, toaster etc.), although a cheese grater might have been useful (a minor gripe but still would’ve been good). The floor throughout the apartment was uneven and ‘bumpy’, illustrated by the fact that we put a toy car on the table between the kids’ beds and it rolled all the way off it in 2 seconds. Yes, these buildings really ARE old!

Anyway, from here on things get better, so we just used the apartment as a place to spend as little time as possible and got out and about instead. There are loads of things to do on the resort, with all sorts of entertainment available for the kids throughout the day (arcades, shows, character meets/photo opportunities, playgrounds, outdoor funfair (free), go karts (£6 per car), zipwire etc.) plus the beach (pebbles, no sand) is right outside, to the rear of the site.

The evening entertainment was very good, with the Redcoats’ enthusiasm unwavering – the kids were engaged and entertained on all 3 nights, with their favourite being the animal show on the last night, which was very good and they enjoyed the disco part of the evening too. However, the queues to get in (and therefore to bag the best seats/tables in whichever venue you’re going to in the evening) start early and the die-hards get themselves in the queue about 30 mins or more before doors open at 7pm. If you’re not one of them, you’ll have to be happy with a seat at the back of the big room.

The absolute highlight of the weekend, however, was the swimming pool, including the spacious changing area. You can tell where all the money has been spent lately (god knows it’s not the apartments), as the swimming pool is fantastic. Having two under 6’s, the tallest of which is about 115cm, there was only one slide of the 5 or 6 available that they couldn’t go on (the height limit on the biggest slide is 120cm with a minimum age restriction of 8), which was a very welcome surprise. The slides, including the ‘rapids’ which take you outside (albeit undercover) and then back in were a real hit with our kids – one can swim, the other still needs a buoyancy vest – and they said that was their favourite of the slides. My only note on this would be that on the 2nd day we went in (at the same time of day as the first, around 3.30pm), it was way too busy and the wave pool seemed dangerously overcrowded. However, for all the complaints about other aspects of the resort, I have to be fair here and admit they’ve absolutely nailed this part.

We didn’t try any of the dining out places as we just cooked for ourselves, but the range and number of places available seems to be very good, although the on-site supermarket was very low on things when we went and the prices are a bit steep (they obviously assume you won’t be bothered to go elsewhere) - you’re better off going out to the huge Sainsbury’s a couple of minutes down the road.

So, overall it was a good break based on the fact that the kids had a good time (and as all parents will know, if the kids are happy it makes the holiday so much better). Basically, the accommodation is, at absolute best, basic and just about tolerable. It’s the entertainment and activities which make it (and which made this a 4 star review rather than 3). If they spend some serious money on repairing/updating the apartments and making them and that part of the resort more attractive/liveable, it would make the place so much better.

So it wasn't surprising we booked a room for 4 nights at The Seaview when we went back last week, and sent them a message through the booking site advising we would be bringing our dog (they are listed as dog friendly on the site).
When booking in, my wife was rather surprised to be told they were not going to accept dogs in future. We were also told the room had no furniture (?) as the dog was staying - we were glad it had 2 beds... - and basically, please pay upfront and don't come back.
The rate included breakfast and I ordered a cooked breakfast and my wife asked for a boiled egg - the lady said: ""We don't do boiled eggs."" so she had toast. When we returned the beds were un-made and the bathroom wasn't cleaned nor towels replaced. The hot water was temperamental - on and off - and an American lady told my wife during breakfast that she had to wash her hair in cold water. She wasn't pleased...
The next day we asked for the bathroom to be cleaned, and it was; but do we need to ask?

The gardens are superb, even in autumnal hues, and are beautifully laid out with the marvellous backcloth of the Cathedral. We enjoyed the kitchen gardens and the glass houses every bit as much as the plants and formal gardens. The Fitzalan family's Roman Catholic chapel is unique - it is one half of a divided building shared with the town's Anglican parish church, which can be accessed from either inside the castle or from the town, but you cannot pass from one half to the other. If you purchase a gold ticket you can have access to the medieval keep, the state rooms, the library, bedrooms and impressive halls, which were reconstructed in the Victorian era. We had time for a coffee break and a sandwich lunch in the restaurant, which was rather impressively furnished. Entry cost us £47.85 including a tour guide - so not a cheap outing - but we got a £7.80 voucher because we gift aided our donation.

10/10 to them for having a full vegi menu too, rather than just a couple of options.

We were lucky to be able to stay at the Town House too. The room was lovely, both spacious and comfortable and we were able to enjoy a lovely cooked to order breakfast.

We were extremely well looked after everyone, particularly Harry who had us laughing throughout.

Waiters and waitresses were very attentive, friendly and helpful. Couldn’t have asked for more from them.

However- that’s all the positives out the way. For around £27 per person per head- I had a couple of pints of coke, nachos starter, Double stack burger, and crumble desert.

Nachos- were disgusting. Cheap quality. Disgusting fake cheese. Guacamole straight out of a jar and lumps of tomato dumped onto the plate (once it’s been nuked in a microwave). It was bland and tasteless... it’s so easy to make Guacamole & Salsa- why the hell is it not made fresh?! And the cheese... jeeze, use REAL cheese!!

The Double Stack Burger- was ok. Burger was burnt, but actually tasted average. Definitely had better burgers- but it was not bad. However- all my parties chips were brown, did not taste or look fresh and were basically ‘just about’ warm... so pretty pathetic in reflection.

The Apple & Berry Crumble was a huge disappointment. Again heating of the custard seems to be an issue- barely warm it was. The crumble topping was nice- the rest was more like a soup. Pretty awful!!

I have been to many restaurants that serve much much better quality food for half the price. This restaurant is totally overpriced and not worth it. The food is very poor quality, lazily prepared and ‘slopped’ together. Do not expect anything of quality or fresh.",2,4.0,2.0,British,1

We were looking for somewhere to have lunch and had previously been in the Diner for milkshakes earlier in our holiday and thought it looked like a good place to have lunch. However after picking our food from the lunch menu and looking forward to our food we were told we should not have been given the lunch menu as the previous day there had been such a delay getting the orders out from the lunch menu so they were not offering it yesterday!!!.. my husband and I were very annoyed as by this point we had all drank our drinks and made our choices and instead of having a reasonably priced lunch now only had the option to pick something from the main menu which was much more expensive and our disappointment and frustration meant we did not fancy anything from the main menu but felt it too late to leave even though I very much wanted to just pay for our drinks and leave and find somewhere else. So we made another choice and ordered the children their meals and were all disappointed with our food. My son ended up his tears he disliked his meal so much as the pulled beef in his taco's (which were supposed to be make your own but came already made up) was so spicy he spent most of the time soaking his tongue in his water and my daughter left most of hers as she said her chips were awful and the burger not much better. I ended up giving most of my dinner to the children so they had something to eat and got the bill leaving with a bitter taste in my mouth of the whole experience and paying £46 for some lunch!..

2395,Robin Hood,Food,Bognor, Pub/Bar,2,Very disappointing,"We were having a 2 night stay in the Premier Inn attached to this ""restaurant"" We often use the ""Premier Inn Basildon"" for breakfast £9.50 all you an eat, and it is excellent, waitress service, always cooked fresh and always hot, not so here at the Robin Hood. The menu is advertised as ""Premier Inn"" and as such you would expect a similar standard - no such luck, We eagerly went down to breakfast to discover a buffet type set up. Cold bacon, over cooked cold sausages, scrambled eggs etc. No bubble and squeak, no poached eggs. All available food was put on to cold plates resulting in a very disappointing breakfast.

That evening we decided to try the evening menu, again the same as our local ""Premier Inn"", why oh why did we bother - we had booked a table for 7.30pm, went down at 7.30 to discover they had given our table away!! We took a table in the bar as offered without making any fuss, were handed menus and told of 2 items unavailable, Hubby made his choice - cod and chips and I made mine - chicken in a basket only to be told ""Oh sorry thats not available"" Made a 2nd choice ""Oh thats not available either"" - and my 3rd choice was unavailable too!! By this time I had lost the will to live and went for gammon roast, 2 very small slices of gammon 3 awful soft roast potatoes and mixed veg arrived with a yorkshire pudding you could have used as a ping pong bat!! NOT GOOD! My husbands fish was not much better, grey looking cod with soggy batter - the triple cooked chips were the only saving grace. I felt very sorry for our waitress as she knew it was not good - she offered us free desserts which we accepted as we were starving. Mine was delicious (chocolate and raspberry torte) my husbands vanilla ice cream was ok too!

Our actual Premier Inn room was lovely, clean tidy and as you would expect, but you really need to sort out the restaurant side of things - we were advised by the grumpy restaurant manager that the restaurant was a different business to the hotel, but in my eyes it is endorsed by Premier Inn and should be a much higher standard.

Stayed here before with no problems, however that was in Winter. Hottest day of the year so far so thought we’d crack the window considering there’s no air con (?! A Hilton and £150 on avg a night, you’d expect a bloody air con and not an industrial fan that sounds like WW3 has started) The window when slid up, slid straight back down again. Great. No problem, we’ll just hitch it up with one of their over priced menus. 👍 Every time we came back to our room it felt warm, suspiciously warm.. turns out the RADIATOR in our room was on so that swiftly went off. After a sticky, restless night we then discovered the radiator was also on in the bathroom and it was STIFLING in there, we couldn’t seem to turn it off so called reception and a man came up told us he couldn’t do it and then he left and we didn’t hear anything so we called back 45 minutes later to be told the radiators stay on we can’t turn them off. Never heard so much rubbish in all my life!! Baking weather and radiators on? Why? What for? We were offered to switch rooms which made no sense as the radiators were on in every room. Hmm. So after this we just said sod it we’ll drive our 2 and 1/2 hour journey home at 9:30pm instead of the morning. Oh but they said we must still pay for our room and breakfast in the morning which is extortionate as it is, even though we weren’t staying! I cannot believe this place is a Hilton, the facilities are SO outdated and uncomfortable the ‘deluxe’ room we paid for promised complimentary wine and chocolates - neither of which were anywhere to be seen. I think a night in the nick would have been more deluxe, at least there’s air conditioning. The only upside to this place is the grounds it is on but we won’t ever come back to stay at this place - save your money and go elsewhere!

We decided against starters so we were given complimentary nachos to nibble on while we waited for our mains, which was a lovely touch and quite tasty, although the cheese appeared to be like the sort you’d expect to come out of a squeezey bottle. The main course (I chose a burger and fries) was huge, far too much for myself, although I’m sure many would be able to finish it off, so great value for money. Unfortunately the burger itself was nothing particularly special, a few of us found the burger bottoms to be quite soggy and found that we had actually been eating the paper it was served on as that too became very soggy. The cheesy chips appeared to have the same squeezey cheese on.

2414,East Beach Café,Food,Littlehampton, Café,6,£8.50 for 3 fish fingers in between 2 slices of bread......,".......does not come close to representing any sort of value for money.

For that price I’d have expected more of a fish goujon contained within a more substantial rustic bread offering....some fries/chips, some crisps, even some salad.....but no!

2 slices of limp sliced brown bread, 3 absolutely bog standard fish fingers, you know, the sort you get a packet of 10 for 50p in Iceland (other frozen and non-frozen food suppliers are available), a thin covering of tartare and some crushed peas.

Did it taste ok? Well yes, but it’s hard to mess it up, but let me tell you, that should not have cost more than £3.50 and they’d still be making double their money at least.

2420,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,3,Family 4 holiday,"First time at a butlins for our family of 4. As we had two young children we chose to go on tots week. Firstly accommodation is somewhat looking very tired and old, definitely need to update the apartments. The whole time we where there, the accommodation reception was open once despite opening times saying it should of been open most days, so on leaving day a lot of people posted room cards through the door. We did have a spacious adapted room for medical needs so can not complain on space. We did find peices of glass on the floor which showed the apartment is not hovered on a regular basis.

Day time entertainment is brilliant; lots to do especially for young children and the new splash pool is brilliant. Evening entertainment was poor, main show was too long for under 5's and we noticed a lot of restless children including our own. The mini disco was not the traditional mini disco more like English nursery rhymes. Entertainment after show was lacking, may of been due to tots week but entertainment finished by 8pm.

Overall it was an ok holiday disappointing for a Butlins first experience. Been to other UK parks with better evening entertainment aimed at all ages. Not sure will be a returning customer.

2422,Bailiffscourt Spa,Attractions,Littlehampton,Spas/Leisure Centres,3,Disappointing experience,"Not the luxury experience I expected.
Booked a pedicure for my daughter and me as a birthday treat.
Asked when booking and paying that we could be together and could we have a glass of fizz or a cuppa.
On arrival we had seconds to choose a polish colour but told not to use the swatch as not all lours available.
Then we were taken off to separate rooms and it was at this point I was told that they have no facility for two people together.
Pedicure was done with me lying down so not sure how I could have sipped fizz or a cuppa!
During the application of the the nail polish I was told it was too thick to continue as the bottle was nearly finished. They did not have any more. The beautician then added something to dilute it.
There was no option for gel polish so we were told to wait in a dark cold room for 45 minutes until we could put our shoes back on.
I feel that £126 was not reflected in the quality or experience.
I did phone to explain my issues. After several days and a second call the manager finally called me back. I don’t think customer satisfaction was a priority.
I will never go back and would not recommend this to anyone.

The eve meal was disappointing, poor produce, small portions and very bland. The chef should not be Proud of that. My breakfast was lame, veggie breakfast with no sausage = one shrivelled tomato, one burn mushroom and a tiny portion of beans, looked pathetic on the plate!

We both thoroughly enjoyed this time however the only downside I would say is that the spa session was 1.30-3.30pm with our treatments booked for 3.30pm this meant that we lost about 15 mins of spa time as we were required to shower, dry off and change into underwear for our treatments. Would be better to allow for showering time between spa use and treatment time.
Overall though the spa was lovely and good value.
The evening entertainment provided by the resort was excellent. A good choice of different shows and we sometimes found ourselves venue-hopping between CentreStage and Reds to make the most of the shows. The queue however for the Stephen Mulhern Show was unbelievable! We got there at 6.30pm for doors open 7pm, show start at 8pm and we joined the queue at the point where a Butlins rep was holding a sign saying “seats can not be guaranteed” Clearly a popular show so maybe have 3 shows instead of 2 would be a better way to ensure families can be seated together. I imagine it’s the same for the Diversity shows mid-week.
One other point was the draught coke tasted very watered down like it didn’t have enough syrup in it. I asked for a shot of cherry in it (as there is now an option to customize your drink) - however couldn’t actually taste the cherry at all.

Daytime activities....
We bought the Adventure passes when we booked which worked out good value for what was included. However the bowling lane broke whilst we were using it and had to be moved to another lane. I’m glad we didn’t pre-book the adrenaline passes as bad weather meant that the high ropes, zip wire and climbing wall were closed the majority of the weekend.

Now for the brand new Splash Waterwotld. ...
Disappointed is an understatement. Expected much better for the swimming pool considering it’s brand new. Not enough for teenagers or adults to do. One fast flume and one family raft flume. Some slides are under 18’s only so stood waited whilst my daughter queued for those. Stood queuing to get on the raft flume, stood queuing for the rapids. No decent size swimming space so stood in the wave machine area. Far too many people in there. Rapids were far too shallow (imagine the amount of water in a flume) so didn’t get pushed along by the force of the water at all & had to push myself along which was tiring after a couple of goes. Worst part was one of the slides after the rapid splits - the long way round - the drop was very painful. Felt like the bottom of the slide hadn’t been joined correctly. There was a painful ridge which resulted in nasty friction burns and bruises to my bottom as well as a graze & bruise to my ankle and and it ripped a hole in my brand new swimming costume, meaning I couldn’t continue in the pool. Massively annoying.

Going back to the changing rooms the exits to the changing rooms had filthy floors from too many outside shoes being worn inside. The main shower area was flooding out towards the lockers (blocked drains?) and the floors around the lockers were also filthy. Considering it was only about 11am I dread to think what they’d be like later in the day. Didn’t see anyone cleaning the floors at all.

One good point about the pool area was the variety/size and number of changing rooms. They also have spinners to dry off your costumes and plastic recyclable bags for you to take your wet stuff away in.

Overall the new pool which was the thing we were most looking forward to trying out was the most disappointing. Probably better suited to those families with toddlers as there’s a lot of younger themed areas in there.

The soft furnishings seemed quite new which was nice and even though the shower had a shower curtain the space was large enough so you didn’t have to go anywhere near it, everything was clean apart from my only niggles which were the fan in the bathroom could do with a good clean and the shower didn’t drain particularly well.
The entertainment that we saw was great, can recommend the 3D animal experience, the fair ground rides were brilliant and the staff always helpful. The main event for us was the pool, we spent a lot of time there, the rapids were amazing!
We were on the premium dining plan and found the food very tasty and plentiful, only thing missing during the very hot week we were there was air conditioning.
All the grounds were maintained beautifully and we have booked to go back next year as you get the best price booking on site.

Accommodation
We stayed in a silver room. It was clean and tidy on arrival. However, the floor was quite uneven and the front door didn’t open all the way as it caught in the opposite wall in the tiny hallway. The bathroom was very basic (as you would expect) but the shower was very hard to climb in and out as it was higher than your average step. The toilet was letting water through every 30/40 seconds. I reported this but it didn’t get fixed until I found a maintenance guy who was very helpful and fixed it for us.

Resort
Was clean grounds well looked after but some areas are looking tired.

Dining
We had paid the extra for premier dining. We have used this dining several times at skegness and loved it. Totally disappointed at Bognor - no live stations as described, all self service. People that where meant to be chefs had no idea what they were doing.
I complained onsite at guest services. Belle - a member of the team said that’s just the way it is at Bognor and the two sites are totally different. She stated that I would have to stand corrected when I mentioned never being allocated a dining room at skegness! She stated I could ask for something off the grill at anytime. I asked several times and was told that this wasn’t allowed. They did get me things when I persisted but I shouldn’t have to as it was part of the package I had paid for! One particular night I asked about the grill menu and was told it was cheese burgers, but they where also on the self service so I could “make one myself”!! Not quite the same experience!!

Funfair
Very good. My children loved the swings and the sizzler ride. Felt very safe again.

Pool
Brand new pool opened this year. The children loved it. All the rides where open and well staffed. It did feel busy at times. The changing area floor is very slippy so just watch little ones in there. They don’t have changing room attendants like st skegness.

2505,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,3,"""carefully curated to fit in with your tot’s routine"" - yeah right","We took our 18 month year old daughter to Butlins last weekend. It was booked as a JUST FOR TOTS weekend, which was advertised as being 'carefully curated to fit a tot's routine', and that there was no need to worry. It was set up to allow for 'enjoying quality time with your mini-me's'.

On paper, this seemed to be true. Amazing acts such as the Teletubbies during the day and Justin Fletcher in the evening which our little one loves made it seem like a no brainer. We took up a variety of offers and ended up with a 'sort out your own food but everything else is covered' total of around £450.

When we got there, the weather was a bit lousy. No one can do much about that. The staff as we entered the parking were happy and helpful, as were the staff on reception who let us know about the activities on whilst we were there. This was when we were told that even though Justin had a couple of shows on, we HAD to take the 7 o'clock showing - which is normally bed time for our little one so already not QUITE fitting our routine... but it was a holiday so we let that slide.

We then proceeded to our Seaside Apartments which we had paid extra for as they were sold as ""Perfect for families"". What they don't tell you is to enter the apartments (if you don't have a ground floor one), you first have to go up a metal spiralling fire escape to get to your floor. We looked around and saw countless families struggling to the 1st and 2nd floors with kids under arms, prams, suitcases and more. Not what I could ever describe as kid-friendly, and more than that what I WOULD describe as unsafe. Due to the bad weather these metal steps were really slippy and at several times over the holiday we had some near slips - particularly when bringing the heavier luggage/prams in and out of the apartment.

Inside the apartment itself was of OK quality, and the living room was comfy. The twin bedroom which we'd specifically booked for a travel cot however was not big enough for one. We ended up having to completely re-arrange all the furniture in there ourselves including stacking some bedside tables to make JUST enough room for the cot.

We also unfortunately were unable to find a room with a bath and there was only a shower - although we were told toddler baths were available to rent from Butlins when we got there. When we went to enquire about this however we were told these were more for tiny babies and would not fit our 18 mo. Therefore an awkward standing-in-the-shower-clutching-the-little-one was needed.

We had arrived on a Friday and saw there was a showing of the Teletubbies in the pavillion starting in 45 minutes - not many people had turned up to the resort for the weekend yet so we strolled down and it seemed relatively quiet... until we got to the central stage. Parents and their children including prams, bags and all sorts had already crowded the front of the stage and meant that our 18 mo had to stand with us at the back near the cafe. This was 45 minutes until anything else happened on the stage - there was no pre-entertainment to entertain the under 5s. If you have a little one of this age you might well know that keeping their attention for this long is near impossible and often results in a cranky child by the time the fun started.

We hoped this was just a one off, but unfortunately this was just the beginning of a heap of problems for us.

The next morning we were up and out of the room just before 9 and had read there was a Toddlers Relaxing swimming session where in the brochure it stated slides etc would be turned off so it was as relaxing for young children as possible.

However when we arrived we were greeted to a huge queue where someone near the front told us they had been waiting 45 minutes as they were operating a one-in-one-out process to get families in to the pool. There was a viewing window of the pool and it looked like a scene from 28 days later there were hoards of people. Parents were forced to congregate standing at the sides of the pool whilst their kids got to put their feet in, but more than that, all of the slides etc were fully operational meaning 4-5 year olds were running up and down and making it extremely difficult for families with smaller children to enjoy themselves. Because of this we bailed on the idea and left the swimming pool.

There were some elements of the pavilion that did operate well. The small rides behind the main stage such as the mini rollercoaster etc had quick queues and the staff did well to always ensure kids were strapped in properly. We ended up spending a good amount of time on here.

We attempted to get in to the soft play area too. As my daughter is only small we were restricted to the left half of the soft play specifically reserved for small children. However this part of the soft play had no ramps, or even steps. The only way to the upper level was through some holes leading to higher up shelves. This was NOT something that most 2 year olds were able to climb on their own, so parents were all heading up it as well to help. However this meant there was a huge blockage of kids ascending/descending down the one way up or down (apart from a slide) and it genuinely took us 25 minutes just to get up the first part of the soft play. Once up it was one level with a slide but also some steep drops that weren't safe for young kids anyway. We went down the slide and left the soft play too.

I understand some people may read this and think I'm moaning but this was for us, an expensive holiday, which we only took up because it was advertised as being a stress free curated holiday built around toddlers. Our daughter spent a huge amount of this trip agitated at having to wait in queues and not understanding she couldn't just run off as we'd lose our place for certain things.

The worst of this was of course the main event of Justin. As already mentioned we had the 7 o'clock showing allocated to us. On the back of the ticket it noted that doors opened from 6 o'clock. It also stated very clearly there would be no queue jumping (even to the point they wouldn't allow someone else in your family to hold a place for the others). But how bad could the queue be? We were in the pavilion at 4.30... and the queue started. These earlybirds were ready to wait in a queue for 1 and a half hours to secure a seat... and then wait an additional hour sat on a chair with no stage entertainment and keep their kids busy. This might be possible with a 4/5 year old you can pass an iPad to, but not with an 18mo. There was no way we could possibly queue for that sort of time with her, and instead we got to the queue at about 5.55. The queue was built up half way around the pavilion and security staff were having to traffic people the right way. We were surrounded with parents holding squirming kids and often having to chase after them, come back to the queue and explain they weren't queue jumping.

We eventually got in at about 6.20 - 40 minutes before the show was due to start. ALL the front seating area was full. Staff were on hand to direct you to empty seats but naturally these were all at the back, and the ones we were sent to were situated behind a huge pillar. We could just make out the stage and as this was meant to be a fun interactive sing/dance along experience for my daughter I was gutted that we were doing it from practically the back of the room.

A crowd next to us had 'reserved' a long string of seating for their friends by putting bags/coats on them and refused to relinquish any for our daughter to be able to see the stage without constantly switching from either side when Justin went behind the pillar in our way.

The actual show was good - and I don't want any of this to come down to Justin's performance, or even the staff at the event. They were genuinely nice and tried to help.

However the overall organisation and I suppose sheer number of people they had crammed in was out of control. It meant that a good 50% of people in there were not getting the experience they wanted. Which may have been alright for the group of wasted dads sat next to us who weren't even facing the stage, but for us who had come specifically for our daughter, it was tragic.

On Sunday, we made the decision that this had been a disaster. Everyone was tired and cranky, especially my daughter, and we came home over a day earlier than we should have done.

I've never left a holiday early before, and I've definitely never felt relieved to be leaving one. But on this occasion it was the right thing to do. Unless something fundamental was to change in the way these weekends are booked/managed I don't think we will ever be coming back.

2506,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,26,Completely unacceptable standard of room,"We visited the Hilton this week and had booked a suite at a cost of £200.

On arrival the outside looks run down but we’re open minded as to the interior. Staff on arrival were friendly and check in process was smooth and quick.

However on arriving at our room all of this went quickly downhill! I cannot even express our disgust at the standard of the room at a Hilton property. Scuffed and peeling wallpaper and skirting boards, broken tiles in the bathroom, windows that were black in the wood. But worst of all of this was the huge patches of damp and water that was coming through the walls. My child suffers from asthma and there was no way we were staying in that room - it was a health hazard and completely unacceptable for any standards let alone a Hilton suite!

On returning to reception the staff were very good and moved us into another room which was of a better standard. However can’t help wondering why we weren’t put into this room in the beginning rather than the disgusting original room as it was empty?!

Just to note the new room wasn’t perfect either and was lacking a chain that actually flushed in the toilet with ease (you had to push the button with two hands and a lot of strength to get it to work!) but was better.

Cannot comment on other facilities as chose to eat out and spend the least amount of time possible at this place, but I can say the original room we were put in was a total rip off and wouldn’t have stayed there at £50 let alone £200! Again reiterate staff were helpful.

Photos speak for themselves of the room! Not impressed!

No apology from him.. took it straight back to the ordering point and said I'm not eating that.

Had to explain to her that an apology would have been nice.

The squid came as lumps of tough over cooked batter with a tiny bit of squid inside and looked more like scampi. It was accompanied by a rather tasteless salad which I left. My friend who normally loves curries left most of hers as she said it was so poor. I rather suspect the salt and pepper squid was frozen. Nothing wrong with that but ideally it should be freshly made as it’s so simple and quick to make.

Having said that, the bar staff were very friendly and the drinks acceptable. The criticism we both had was the price of the food. At over £12 each this is far too much for what is not even gastro pub quality.

2532,"Crossbush, Beefeater",Food,Arundel, Steakhouse/Diner,2,Very Disappointing Birthday Breakfast,"The standards we have experienced on previous visits here have all but disappeared.

This visit was for a family member's breakfast for seven of us. On arrival we were eventually greeted and told that there was no record of any pre-booking, however, we were eventually taken to a seating area which was away from the main area and nobody else seated in there which made it feel a little unwelcoming to start with.

After a while a waitress appeared and took our breakfast orders. There was no welcome smile or warm reception from her in fact she was quite offhand and abrupt.

In the meantime we went to the self-service breakfast bar which was in bit of a mess and was urgently needing some attention from the staff.We had to request decaffeinated coffee for two of us from a staff member and after a short wait he appeared with one single sachet of decaff coffee despite two of us requiring it! So off he trots and returns with a second sachet, not any to stock up the table. The fruit salad that we had was just about edible as the orange segments were extremely tough and bitter.

After a considerable wait some of the cooked breakfast meals arrived at the table albeit different to the orders we placed. There was no offer from the waitress to resolve the mix up this so we sorted it as such by swapping items from plate to plate. The food itself was just about warm but just about edible. After another wait the remaining outstanding meals arrived which were as ordered. Again they food wasn't very hot. We proceeded to eat the breakfast which was nowhere as good as it had been on previous visits. The bacon flavour was tainted by what tasted like steak from the griddle. The eggs were a little undercooked and so it went on.

My wife ordered poached eggs with bacon and tomato which when it turned up looked lost as it was a small portion served on a full sized plate. So she eat this but decided to order the same again as the first portions served up was very small and the eggs weren't cooked that well. After a wait of 15 minutes or more her reorder eventually arrived at the table but way after everybody else had finished their food. This felt awkward to her but she did reluctantly eat it only because we persuaded her to. This food was also only just warm so again very disappointing.

For what we paid, the whole breakfast this time didn't feel like good value for money and the unwelcoming service from the staff really spoilt what should have been a happy family occasion. We didn't wish to remain in the restaurant anymore so settled the bill and left.

As a result of this very disappointing visit, it's very unlikely that we will be returning there very soon for another family visit.

Given our previous experience of the pub chain our expectations were very low........

We were totally taken aback at just how good our experience at The Worlds End was;-

service was friendly, helpful, attentive, fast and efficient.
there was a large menu choice (truly something for everyone ) with additional ‘specials’.
the food was perfectly cooked (so good not to have overcooked vegetables!) and generous portions.
good value for money.
a good ambience of people enjoying themselves (given how busy the pub was it’s obviously very popular).
absolutely spotless toilets (so rare!).

For a part of a pub chain catering for large numbers of people of different ages, tastes, budgets etc this was excellent - a very well run business.

So we went in and ordered.
Our starter was nice and I had a feeling we would have a nice time.
Until we wanted our mains. After an hour and a half wait I went back in and asked if our mains were ready, oh yes they'll be out soon. Bear in mind we had a toddler with us who wanted dinner!
Not 5 minutes later the food comes out. My partners dish was lukewarm at best. My friends steak was cooked wrong and her salad was brown and curling. My steak was also cooked totally wrong. Luckily the toddler had a good meal. So I took the steaks back (my partner was so hungry at this point she had to eat something) and complained. A half arsed apology was given and 2 more were cooked, again, totally wrong. I again went in to complain that the order was wrong and again food was sent back out. The steak I received was still cooked wrong but at this point I was starving and had to eat something. My friends steak looked better, but there was almost no meat in the steak, the cut was all grissle and bland. It was also cold. Oh, and the peas that came on the plate had freezer burn and were disgusting. The meal was an absolute disaster. Went back in and got a full refund for the meal. Luckily I spoke to the nice member of staff, who also gave my friends toddler a free ice cream in way of apology.

2542,Butlins,Accommodation,Bognor,Hotel,14,Property stolen from our room,"Stayed here 8th - 12th July 2019. This is the second year we have visited the resort. The rooms are in desparate need of a refresh but the new pool was great and that is what we have given the 1 star for. The reason for my negative review is the customer service we received after we left. Our 1 year old was sick so we rushed home and left 1 bag of our items in the electric cupboard. So as soon as we realised I attempted to call guest services. This alone took over 48 hours to get through to them. Finally I have spoken to 3 different people and was promised a call back by 12 noon once the cleaners had checked the cupboard for me. 12noon comes no call so I asked the lady when I can expect a call or call back myself. She then told me 4pm but this is when the new guests check in surely the room could be checked at 11am when the previous guests left or whilst they were there give them a curtesy knock to ask to check the electric cupboard? So I call back at 2pm to find out that our stuff has indeed been stolen which amounts to just over £300 plus a bank card. So disappointing as should this have been dealt with promtly and efficiently we could have got our stuff back. Will not reccomend butlins to anyone nor book another holiday with them.

2547,World's End,Food,Arundel, Pub/Bar,214,Well run and NOT pricey,"Fairly big Hall & Woodhouse establishment, pubby part and a restaurant area, all nicely refurbished with lots of rural artefacts and prints. We were allocated a pleasant table but constantly in my sightline were two ladders on the wall behind my dining companion so all the rungs were strangely affecting my eyesight as I chatted...I don't think it was the wine so I will avoid that particular table in future. The radiators were throwing out a good amount of heat on a cold January evening and the restaurant was reasonably busy so good ambiance. We were in the restaurant part where all orders are taken at the table so no longer do you have to go to the counter to place orders for drinks and food with your table number so a big improvement to previous.

Extensive menu with a number of more exciting dishes in addition to pub classics, good portions, and some interesting ""healthy"" vegetables on several main dishes, not just chips and peas. Reasonable choice of wines by the glass and other drinks, teas and coffees to finish. Good range of both Salcombe dairy ice creams and a choice also of non dairy ices which you don't see so often.

Good service from very well trained young staff, competent and proficient although slightly mechanical. There was a delay in our second round of coffees appearing and this was picked up on by the serving staff who apologised for the wait. Most efficient.

Overall very good value, would not consider it at all pricey in comparison with other establishments in rural West Sussex.

I am somewhat biased in favour of ""individual"" pubs but the Worlds End is workmanlike, pleasant and professional so will return. Easy parking with both a front and rear car park.

My tip: Avoid the table opposite the wall mounted ladders!",4,1.0,2.0,British,0

I would guess the other waitresses knew the weak-link as occasionally they would enquire re drinks and then our waitress would come over and look exasperated at the others for doing her job.

In total we had to wait about 20 minutes for starters, when the restaurant was less than half full, and then our main was about 45 minutes after finishing the starter - and only arrived 10 minutes after we queried with the waitress. Perhaps we were unlucky as there were people who arrived when we were eating our starter and had left before our main arrived.

I hadn’t heard great things but my Nan and grandad had booked it for their 60th wedding anniversary. All together there were 12 of us. From the get-go we all felt quite rushed to eat - we had already let them know our ordered before we arrived and we were serviced within 5 minutes of sitting down. I had roast beef and it was disappointing - the potatoes tasted like frozen Aunt Bessie’s. It was all slightly cold as well. I asked for some more gravy and the waitress who looked so miserable said she would get some. I waited for 10 minutes and still no gravy. I asked again and she said ‘yes I’m getting it’ in a very teenage stroppy kind of way. She then comes out with the gravy in a measuring jug!!!!!!

When it came to the cake and Prosecco, I was refused a glass of Prosecco (despite being 27 and being with my whole family) because I didn’t have my ID. I understood, but to then be told by the waitor that if I tried to drink any he would come and physically take it away from me was extremely rude and threatening. I decided just to have the cake but wasn’t served any cutlery with it. I asked for a fork (from the moody waitress) and she returned with 25 forks and chucked them in front of me without saying anything.

Overall a very, very, very disappointing trip here. Unhappy staff who clearly didn’t want to be there and were taking it out on customers paying a lot of money. I definitely won’t be coming back.",1,1.0,2.0,British,1

2564,World's End,Food,Arundel, Pub/Bar,459,Rubbish roast! Expensive rubbish too.,"If you look at the menu here it seems the manager has ideas above his station, and above the capabilities of the cook as well! Far too many items on the menu, so hardly surprising they're poorly executed. Prawn cocktail with peppers and celery in it to bulk it out, ewww, probably why they think they can charge ridiculous prices, just for being pretentious.

The roast beef lunch wasn't worth £5 (it was nearly £15). The meat was OK but it certainly didn't melt in the mouth, took a fair bit of knife work to cut up unfortunately. The gravy was bland, tasted like dishwater. The roast potatoes were advertised as being in beef dripping, they definitely weren't! I do roast potatoes in beef dripping every time I cook a roast, they crisp up nicely and have great flavour, these potatoes were really bland and tasteless, not even seasoned.

The Yorkshire pudding was OK, but tasted strangely sweet, like it was cooked using honey (would have been great for a dessert with ice cream and maple syrup topping but) not great with a savoury roast. Worst of all were the vegetables! I like mine Al dente, these were practically raw! Seems like they were heated up in boiling water but then served before they were cooked. No horseradish or mustard offered at any point.

As I popped to the ladies loo I couldn't but help notice a lot of plates which had contained roast dinners were left on tables with lots of veg still on them. Shame none of the waiting staff mentioned the undercooked veg to the cook.

We received 2 check backs within a minute of each other, both less than 2 minutes before we finished trying to eat our food, so certainly not worth wasting time pointing out how awful the food was.

The cook obviously doesn't taste what he/she serves to customers, pretty sure if the food was tasted anyone worth their salt wouldn't have the nerve to hand it to customers and actually charge for it. I wouldn't eat here again if it was free! I value my taste buds and stomach.

Looks good from the outside but definitely a place to keep driving past!

I can't understand why this place was so busy, with such a poorly executed roast lunch and expensive dishes on the menu this place had no redeeming features at all. Pretty place but lots of unhygienic dusty hops hanging in the rooms, over dining tables too, yuck.",1,3.0,2.0,British,1

Entrance is very expensive and also very complicated. 4 different price plans for a ‘normal’ adult, then vouchers to use at the over priced gift shop and cafe. You get asked at least 6 times during your visit to the castle to show your ticket.

The biggest disappointment was the lack of history explained. The information given as you walk around is in no sensible chronological order and doesn’t give any stories. You do however know the dimensions of a room, when it was renovated and by whom. I don’t care about that, give me some basic simple history please. Like in every other castle and historic home.

I also asked if it would be possible to have either a glass of fizz or a cuppa together whilst we were having the pedicure and was to,d this would be fine.
The duration was confirmed at one hour.
On arrival we were given literally a few seconds to choose a colour of varnish and told not to bother with the swatch book as all the colours were not available.
Then to my surprise my daughter and I were taken off to separate rooms. I obviously questioned this and to my surprise was told that they did not have the facility to do two people together.
The pedicure was done lying down so would be difficult to drink wine or a cuppa.
,there was no option of gel polish and I was told we needed an extra 45 minutes at the end of the treatment for the nail polish to dry.

2597,Clymping Beach,Attractions,Littlehampton,Beach/Outdoor,7,Dreadful,"Visited Climping to take a walk on the beach. Car park £1.50 an hour or £7.50 the day - outrageous. So we parked further along, free in the street, & walked past Climping. There is almost no beach, shingle having been washed away. Didn't use the café but the toilets were AWFUL. Dirty, no seats, no toilet paper, no soap, nothing to dry your hands on. What is the car park fee for exactly? DON'T BOTHER.",1,3.0,2.0,0,1

2601,Avisford,Accommodation,Arundel,Hotel,6,Fantastic And Wonderful!!!,"I visited this wonderful hotel in September and wrote a review when I got home but for some reason it did not publish and it has been on my mind ever since to make sure that I write it again. It was a busy day when we arrived and Stacey and Tina in housekeeping were working so hard but managed to keep smiling and welcome us back to the hotel ensuring we felt like valued guests. The hotel is very clean and when you see how many guests are staying you realise how hard the housekeeping team work to uphold the high standard. The bar, restaurant and reception staff were great as usual but I have to give special mention to Callum for his wonderful strawberry and raspberry smoothie. It was the most refreshing drink and the tastiest smoothie I have ever had, it would be great to see this on the menu, I think they would go down very well especially in the hot summer months. I look forward to returning to the hotel and seeing all the fantastic staff in the new year.
