The Black Rabbit is in a perfect waterside location with plenty of seating overlooking the river and with views of Arundel Castle.

I think the staff possibly got caught off guard today. Who would have expected the last Monday in February to have a full day of wall to wall sunshine and temperatures reaching 18 degrees?

Not a problem until 55 minutes later we saw other people who had ordered long after us eating their food. I think we got forgotten but the member of staff was very apologetic, chased our order and it was on the table 10 minutes later.

The food was great and definitely worth the wait.

Carol, our waitress at lunchtime couldn’t do enough for us so we decided to book for the evening as well, and we explained our dietary needs.

When we arrived for our evening meal Liz (our waitress), who had been there for seventeen years looked after us and Hannah, the manager was also on hand to make sure everything was ok.

They chef, who had been made aware of our dietary requirements had actually taken the time to prepare a special meal just for us based on our whole food plant-based diet.

This restaurant and its staff went above and beyond and we were humbled by their willingness to help and accommodate us.

The food was absolutely amazing.

So, if you are a vegetarian, vegan or on a whole-food plant-based diet I can highly recommend this restaurant.

We had a very pleasant drink of draught lager and ordered some food. I ordered the Chicken BLT and
my wife wanted just some chips with skins on.
That’s where it all went downhill - the chips both on their own and with the BLT were over cooked to the point of them being inedible!
The bread that the BLT was in was dry and almost stale.
We had both had a long day and could not be bothered to raise the issue with the staff as in my opinion they should know if they are serving rubbish food!

Oh dear how we found things have changed when we visited there two times this month

Ambience Dinner, and lunch

The same table we had both times felt sticky and so unpleasant to the touch, the table location at the end of the restaurant was very noisy on both occasions but especially at the dinner serving

The service

at the dinner this was just about ok, the waitress was busy so we could understand some errors that she made to the orders, our group thought she was being over familiar and overtly friendly

The lunchtime service was better although one waitress obviously thought we were all deaf by the volume of her speaking to the group

The food,

honestly some dishes were good, others dry and tastless,

All the food was very well cooked with great flavours and a good price.
The only downside we had was the table where we were sat, right beside the bar. The problem being the shape of the bar encroached on your table space making you feel cramped.

Think about that. 7 minutes standing there hoping someone would at least give us a nod, let alone approach us with an 82yr old and 2 small overheating thirsty girls. Totally unacceptable and I should have left then but the girls were hungry and it was my 82yr old mums birthday. What a treat she got, not.

When the server finally came over she sternly asked if we’d booked (as though it was unlikely we’d get a place)? It was 5:45pm, hello.

The restaurant was half empty by the way so id dread to think what it’s like when it’s busy. Unless you have the patience of a saint id avoid this place. I’ve come here on and off for years when invited by others and although the food has improved, it’s more expensive than it used to be but there’s always a problem either with hygiene, sticky tables, rude staff (not today though, they just didn’t get near us), poor supply to the salad bar, etc.

30 mins after being seated we were given no salad bowls but more importantly we were parched but STILL NO drinks on the hottest day of the year, so no rehydrating my 4 and 6 yr old in sweltering heat. 30 minutes after ordering with not even the jug of water that we ordered is unacceptable in that heat. When I finally had enough I wandered up and got my own jug at the bar. Intriguingly it had a big bite mark chunk out the side of the skanky worn out water jug. It should have been in the bin. Oh and they don’t have any ice on the hottest day in summer!!! Basil Faulty runs this place, surely?

No tomatoes or cucumbers in the salad bar just a watery mess where they once lived. Loads of sauces to choose from but it was a lucky dip as none were labelled running the risk of giving your child chilli sauce instead of ketchup or relish.

We ate the cut-down salad off little side plates as nobody gave us bowls so we improvised with what was there. My mum only had salad bar as she’s elderly so her whole meal was on a tiny side plate! Disgraceful.

After being left to fend for ourselves I cleared the finished salad plates myself in the end and put them on the tray I got from the bar when I went to serve myself and my family that jug of water.

As a side note I took my little one to the men’s bathroom. She’s kicked off her sandals under the table in the heat but I hadn’t realised. She then walked into the toilet and walked in urine leaking from the urinals. They had put out of a sign to say wet floor but it was puddles of wee all over the bathroom everywhere so my little princess had walked through lots of pee to get from the cubicle to the sinks, the poor little mite. It should have been mopped up or locked up.

Nobody asked how the food was, we weren’t offered any more drinks (not that they arrive anyway) despite it being sweltering. We didn’t get spoken to by anyone in that whole time since ordering food and due to the continued lack of staff I eventually had to go up and stand at the tills and interrupt a member of staff in order to actually pay the bill and get the hell out of there.

I noticed on the wall above the till it said something like “remember, no more bad reviews like the one from D.L” with a big arrow pointing towards it or something similar so it’s not as if they don’t know they need to buck up their ideas. To be fair the 2 people I encountered at the till were kind and apologetic. I wasn’t one of their tables but you could see they were frustrated and working under pressure in what seemed like a sinking ship so I did have sympathy for them. Very poorly managed though I’m afraid and lots of customers looked disgruntled. More staff and someone in maintenance to sort the bathroom, ice machine, I’ve cream machine is what’s needed.

The simple food took 45 minutes to arrive which is way too long in a half empty restaurant. Other restaurants set your expectations if there’s a long wait over 20 mins.
The food itself was ok when it arrived but I just wanted to get out of there by that point. I’d have to be desperate to go back there

On my way out I passed other miserable looking families that I’d seen waiting to be spoken to / seated for ages.

490,3119,Littlehampton,2,"Take away very disappointing  Since we were unable to go out for a meal my sons decided to treat me to a Harvester take away for Father’s Day.

One of them placed the order online via the Harvester website at 7pm for collection at 9pm. One of my sons wanted the “Cowboy” burger but didn’t want bacon on it as he doesn’t eat pork, although you can “customise” your order there is no way to exclude an item, only change the sides. When confirming the order the site suggests phoning the restaurant if you want any changes. The site also advises that the details have been emailed.

After about 15 minutes I phoned the restaurant and said I wanted to modify an online takeaway order. The person who answered said he couldn’t find it on their system and since no email confirmation had been received yet I should call back when that had been received.

I rang back shortly after 8pm as I was concerned that we’d still not had email confirmation and since the phone wasn’t answered I left a voice message asking them to ring me.

Come time the order was due to be collected I was greeted well and the server went to bag up the order which only took a couple of minutes. I took the order home and my wife was dismayed to find that although she had ordered 2 jacket potatoes with her “Simply Chicken” these were not to be found but it appeared she had a portion of chips instead. She had also not received any gravy. Her vegetables were cold, not room temperature, actually cold.

We felt the portions were small considering the prices seemed pretty high.

We had ordered 4 desserts which were not to be found so I returned to the restaurant. The server (no name badge that I could see) was extremely apologetic and went to get the desserts.

The chef brought the desserts out and explained they need to be heated at home since if they were to heat them the plastic containers would melt. This should be made clear on the menu when ordering.

All the staff looked tired after what had probably been a long busy day but were still polite, helpful and friendly. That was the only redeeming feature as we felt the food was poor value and quality as was the accuracy of the order.

Over 4 hours later we still haven’t received a confirmation email or return phone call.

My friend had a gastric band fitted and was able to select a childrens portion of meal with a small helping of salad.

Our waitress, Marie, gave a warm introduction and assured me that my choice of nachos and beef chilli would not be too hot!

The beef chilli, when it arrived was certainly not too hot! It was lukewarm but edible. The rice was almost cold.

Our waitress had vanished and I found her at the bar, at the back of our dining area, pouring drinks. Certainly our table was not visible from the bar and obviously the time the waitress needs to be at the bar means she is not in a position to observe and respond to the need of customers.

Marie honestly admitted there had been a problem and offered to replace the meal.
Service had been very, very slow. We had arrived at 12.35 pm and our final bill was paid at 14.27. pm and would be too slow for most people.

It seems things can be stressful for staff. I had selected a two course meals at about £9 but on the initial bill were overcharded £6.49. We then settled the correct bill.

It was bland and tasteless... it’s so easy to make Guacamole & Salsa- why the hell is it not made fresh?! And the cheese... jeeze, use REAL cheese!!

The Double Stack Burger- was ok. Burger was burnt, but actually tasted average. Definitely had better burgers- but it was not bad. However- all my parties chips were brown, did not taste or look fresh and were basically ‘just about’ warm... so pretty pathetic in reflection.

The Apple & Berry Crumble was a huge disappointment. Again heating of the custard seems to be an issue- barely warm it was. The crumble topping was nice- the rest was more like a soup. Pretty awful!!

I have been to many restaurants that serve much much better quality food for half the price. This restaurant is totally overpriced and not worth it.

The available croissants were heated on request. The Costa coffee machine came up with warm rather than hot coffee and a latte that had very little coffee in the meagre shot just lots of milk.

Not only did the chef cook my medium/rare steak perfectly but it came with 3 large king prawns and a large portion of equally perfectly cooked calamri.

I got there early and sat down with a pint, looked very nice and I waited in a seat being watched by an old man with a drink he hadn't touched, he didn't take his eyes off me, thought he was actually dead sitting up.
Had my drink and decided to grab the table we had pre-booked. The staff member I dealt with was actually very nice. Anyway, my partner and our friend arrived and we all sat down with toddler and had a nose at the menu. Food sounded amazing and the price was fair.
So we went in and ordered.
Our starter was nice and I had a feeling we would have a nice time.
Until we wanted our mains. After an hour and a half wait I went back in and asked if our mains were ready, oh yes they'll be out soon. Bear in mind we had a toddler with us who wanted dinner!
Not 5 minutes later the food comes out. My partners dish was lukewarm at best. My friends steak was cooked wrong and her salad was brown and curling. My steak was also cooked totally wrong. Luckily the toddler had a good meal. So I took the steaks back (my partner was so hungry at this point she had to eat something) and complained. A half arsed apology was given and 2 more were cooked, again, totally wrong. I again went in to complain that the order was wrong and again food was sent back out. The steak I received was still cooked wrong but at this point I was starving and had to eat something. My friends steak looked better, but there was almost no meat in the steak, the cut was all grissle and bland. It was also cold. Oh, and the peas that came on the plate had freezer burn and were disgusting. The meal was an absolute disaster. Went back in and got a full refund for the meal. Luckily I spoke to the nice member of staff, who also gave my friends toddler a free ice cream in way of apology.
They should not be allowed to serve food here at all aside from the snacks behind the bar.

It turns out the menu downstairs is different from upstairs (I didn't realise there was an upstairs until later in the meal). I ordered a kids margherita pizza and moule frites

The kids pizza came up. The base was flavourless and undercooked and it was smothered in cheese and covered with herbs and rocket salad. Fine for an adult. Not fine for a fussy 3 year old.

The mussels were worse. I ordered it with chips but was offered bread as there was plenty of sauce. I said yes to this but then turned out it was bread OR chips so never received the chips. It didn't matter in any case as the mussels hadn't been washed and I after 4-5 mouthfuls of grit and sand I gave up and sent it back and picked at the equally inedible pizza.

On the upside the service was friendly. The waitress did apologise and said she would tell the chef / not charge for the mussels which was fine.

836,3675,Bognor,2,"Terrible Service We stayed at the attached Premier Inn, having been in the area attending a 21st birthday lunch, so the Robin Hood was the obvious choice for a light bite that evening.

We opted to have just sharer starters and dessert, but were there for two hours because the service was so slow - you would guess because it was a Saturday evening and therefore busy, but it was not and there were lots of empty tables (which surprised us because we'd booked a table online several days before and could only get 1815 or 2000, so had assumed everything else in between was already reserved).

However, the worst part for us was when we ordered a 0% Kopparberg cider for our 17 year old daughter mid-way through our visit. This was brought over by someone other than the waitress we'd placed the order with, and he immediately asked our daughter for ID. We questioned him and stated that it was a NO-Alcohol drink, assuming he hadn't realised that it wasn't a 'normal cider'; but he insisted on knowing their age stating that it still came under the same alcohol regulations - to which we advised him she was 17. He then said 'that's fine because even it was alcoholic there is no problem, as they could still be bought an alcoholic drink by an adult when eating in a restaurant' - by which time we really couldn't see the point in the whole conversation.....!!

Unfortunately, the episode had upset both our children, and our daughter left the restaurant after the starter not wanting to stay any longer and have a dessert. Our 12 year old son was absolutely stunned by the questioning, and kept repeating 'I don't understand, it was NO-Alcohol'.

We had no issue with the food served, but the service was appallingly slow - and the unnecessary questioning over what was essentially a mixed fruit squash left us all dumbfounded.

(For clarification, we looked into the ID issue after we left, and law only states that under 18's cannot buy or be served alcohol that has a content of 0.5% or more - this 'cider' was 0%, zero, nothing, null, nil - with the exception of a licenced premises serving food when a 16 or 17 year can then be bought an alcoholic beverage by an adult).

The only saving grace really was that we had a Tesco Clubcard voucher to cover the cost of the food, otherwise we would probably have left long before any of it was even served. Our bill left to pay came to a little over £11.00, but we were paying cash so ended up leaving the waitress with a £20 note and telling her to keep the change - as we dared not waste any more of our time waiting for her to come back with it!!

Lunch was lovely, 3 burgers and 1 vegan burger with two Camembert starters.

A couple of things to improve on:
1. I had a large glass of wine which appeared not to have been cooled at all. I think the better option for the server would have been to advise that that bottle was not cold and did I want another option. Room temperature white wine... meh. (to be fair, I did not tell the staff - so no replacement was requested/given)
2. My husband wanted the cheesecake - nope! none of that left. Then he changed to the brownie - nope! none of that either. That's ok, we'll have a lovely after lunch coffee - nope! The coffee machine is broken. We weren't presented with any alternatives like - can we get you a cup of tea on the house???

It was nice and fresh inside and appeared to be more of a restaurant than a pub with most tables either reserved or laid out for eating. Outside it was exactly the same as it has always been - 6 or so rickety old benches, no umbrellas and traffic to and from the car park going past. Not an easy place to eat on a hot day if you hadn't reserved a table inside so forward planning is needed!

The food was fine, but as other reviewers have commented pricey for what it was.

Staff were harassed and hurried and completely ignored the bar in favour of the restaurant duties for up to 10 minutes at a time. There was no acknowledgement of your presence at the bar. There was generally a tense atmosphere inside with staff crashing about - I would guess management is either poor or ineffective as there did seem to be plenty of staff on duty.

The George is a nice looking pub in a good location and may well be better on a quieter day.

If you want a walk along the river from Arundel then try going on the other side to the Black Rabbit - it is popular but there is a good reason for that - Plenty of shaded seating in a fantastic location on the river, friendly efficient staff and good pub food at decent prices.

We booked a table at 8:45 - we arrived at 8:30 and had a drink from the bar. We were told that our table would be ready soon. As we were having our drinks the manager came to take our food order, we asked for more time (ideally to order at our actually table), a few moments later another waiter came over to ask for our order - we reluctantly gave him our order but specifically asked him not to rush us. Our table was ready at 9:15 and when we walked over, our starters were sat waiting for us... we do not how long the food was left out (we both had cold starters - gazpacho and terrine). We were not offered a wine menu, or bread which other tables had. We asked to speak to the manager and explained that we specifically asked not to be rushed and we have never had our food waiting for us at the table - especially at a higher end establishment that Butlers portrays itself. She was very lack lustre and left us feeling dejected. She offered us a liqueur to be had at the end of the meal and walked off.

We didn’t wish to have a liqueur and we settled the bill. We left with a customary “bye” from the manager.

Received within 10 mins. The lollipops were the 2 popcorn sized bites on a bone in breadcrumbs-well overcooked & 2 bites. For mains we ordered roast beef & lamb. The roast potatoes were rock hard you couldnt even cut with knife, the yorkie burnt & the veg had a funny taste & well over cooked. The beef was so fatty, grisly & you couldnt even cut through it so my cousin couldnt eat it so we told the waitress.

We were then greeted by the owner who came up to our table placing his hands on it & in an agressive manner said ""i believe you have a problem with your food"".

Received within 10 mins. The lollipops were the 2 popcorn sized bites on a bone in breadcrumbs-well overcooked & 2 bites. For mains we ordered roast beef & lamb. The roast potatoes were rock hard you couldnt even cut with knife, the yorkie burnt & the veg had a funny taste & well over cooked. The beef was so fatty, grisly & you couldnt even cut through it so my cousin couldnt eat it so we told the waitress.

The garlic bread/olives were excellent, lovely texture and flavour.

Mains were fish & chips/chicken burger/fillet steak/carvery/kids meal. All were superb, the steak was perfect and beautifully presented. The carvery I was particularly impressed with, as it can't be easy keeping food hot and not drying out when not everyone is eating it. But it was hot, and the meat was lovely and generous serving.

Everything was really well priced and compared to a Harvester or such, this was far superior.

Service was also excellent. We were served quickly and nothing was too much trouble.

1183,4162,Bognor,1,"Amazing food, worst service ever Let me start by congratulating the chefs at Cardamon Bay tonight for producing absolutely wonderful looking and tasting food, in a very timely manner from when our order was taken, despite a busy Mother's Day service.
However, I can only rate our experience as 1 for the following reasons:
We waited ages to order our food, and eventually had to rather obviously flag someone down.
When I was deliberating over a suitable vegetable dish for my children, I was basically told by a waiter to hurry up because he had other orders to take; it was said in the nicest possible way so I just assumed that he was feeling pressurised and thought no more of it.
However the rudeness continued. When my husband ordered a drink when the food arrived, we were left with no drinks at all until the end of the meal, my older children were sharing out the baby's drink, and my husband was gesturing to the manager at the bar, who kept looking up, then looking away. I managed to catch another member of staff, but after my first sentence, she asked me to ""wait one minute"", ran off, and we couldn't catch another member of staff for at least 5-10 minutes. The member of staff who did eventually take our drinks order was then rude to my husband.
There was also a small incident while we were there. A member of staff accidentally dropped a glass container/bottle which shattered very near a sleeping baby in a carrier, near our table and right next to another customer. The manager asked everyone nearby not to move while they cleaned up, and then proceeded to loudly berate the waitress in her mother tongue, until he noticed people looking and promptly became nicey nicey.
Overall it appeared that members of staff had been given roles that they were not allowed to deviate from despite the obvious need for multitasking and this was unchecked, some members of waiting staff were rude and under pressure and this was unchecked, some front of house staff may not have had the language skills necessary for interaction with and service of customers especially during a busy service, the manager showed very poor form in his treatment of his staff member who had had the accident with glass and he was commanding to my husband when we entirely decided to cancel our second drinks order and pay the bill at the door on exit whilst explaining why we were so disappointed with our experience.
Such a shame. The kitchen team handled the busy service and turned out some gorgeous food, but it was an epic fail for the front of house team led (or not) by their manager. The worst service we've experienced anywhere at least for the last 10 years, if not more.",member staff eventually take drink order rude husband,drink order rude husband,"['drink', 'order', 'rude', 'husband']",Ordering

Did I mention the chips? Delicious, big chunks of real potato, piping hot and well fried, some people might prefer them a bit browner, but they suited me down to the ground and I tucked in with gusto.

Also I appreciate it is wrong to judge a place on a single visit so allowances there too.

However the meal was the worst meal I have ever eaten - a platter of seafood - whitebait, scampi, calamari and ‘fish balls’.
Without thinking too deeply about it I ordered it with chips as well.

What arrived was a large plate of the items described and everything battered and fried plus a serving of very tired looking fried chips.
The mass of fried and battered items looked awful, was not that nice to eat and I left most fearing heartburn, indigestion and an upset stomach besides a calorie intake that should raise alarm bells.

Ok I was stupid ordering a completely ridiculous fried selection and badly balanced meal but it begs the question why was it on the menu in the first place?

I noted the remains of other similar ‘platters’ being left by other customers.

If the meal 5 of us had recently is anything to go on, we will definitely NOT be back. It took ¾ of an hour to actually place an order, although there were hardly any customers. The starters were okay, but the deep fried Brie was overdone, hard on the outside and cold in the middle. The vegetarian options seemed good, until we tried them. The veggie lasagne was small, approximately 3 inches square; bland and tasteless. The Squash was just average and dry, no sauce. I left most of it. The steak had a 2 inch piece of grizzle. The two Ploughmans however, were fine, nice big pieces of cheese. But the 'piece de resistance' was the treacle tart. Yes I am joking. There was no treacle in the treacle tart. It was just pastry that stuck in the throat. Inedible and most of it was left. We did complain, but it seemed to fall on deaf ears.

Mine arrived clearly having been reheated, glassy and of bad quality but my partners did not. After a 15 Min. wait a very raw baked potato was presented. We sent it back, He shared mine and we didn’t make a fuss as we were out with 7 other family members who’s food was equally as shocking.
Apologies were forthcoming from the dear waitress, who was great, for the raw potato but no effort was made by management to possibly pay for a drink or in any way recover some form of compensation for making a family lunch very uncomfortable and unpleasant. Rather that enjoy a leisurely lunch with family, we ate and left as soon as we could

1359,4407,Arundel,1,"Rubbish roast! Expensive rubbish too. If you look at the menu here it seems the manager has ideas above his station, and above the capabilities of the cook as well! Far too many items on the menu, so hardly surprising they're poorly executed. Prawn cocktail with peppers and celery in it to bulk it out, ewww, probably why they think they can charge ridiculous prices, just for being pretentious.

The roast beef lunch wasn't worth £5 (it was nearly £15). The meat was OK but it certainly didn't melt in the mouth, took a fair bit of knife work to cut up unfortunately. The gravy was bland, tasted like dishwater. The roast potatoes were advertised as being in beef dripping, they definitely weren't! I do roast potatoes in beef dripping every time I cook a roast, they crisp up nicely and have great flavour, these potatoes were really bland and tasteless, not even seasoned.

The Yorkshire pudding was OK, but tasted strangely sweet, like it was cooked using honey (would have been great for a dessert with ice cream and maple syrup topping but) not great with a savoury roast. Worst of all were the vegetables! I like mine Al dente, these were practically raw! Seems like they were heated up in boiling water but then served before they were cooked. No horseradish or mustard offered at any point.

As I popped to the ladies loo I couldn't but help notice a lot of plates which had contained roast dinners were left on tables with lots of veg still on them. Shame none of the waiting staff mentioned the undercooked veg to the cook.

We received 2 check backs within a minute of each other, both less than 2 minutes before we finished trying to eat our food, so certainly not worth wasting time pointing out how awful the food was.

The cook obviously doesn't taste what he/she serves to customers, pretty sure if the food was tasted anyone worth their salt wouldn't have the nerve to hand it to customers and actually charge for it. I wouldn't eat here again if it was free! I value my taste buds and stomach.

Looks good from the outside but definitely a place to keep driving past!

Extensive menu with a number of more exciting dishes in addition to pub classics, good portions, and some interesting ""healthy"" vegetables on several main dishes, not just chips and peas. Reasonable choice of wines by the glass and other drinks, teas and coffees to finish. Good range of both Salcombe dairy ice creams and a choice also of non dairy ices which you don't see so often.

Good service from very well trained young staff, competent and proficient although slightly mechanical. There was a delay in our second round of coffees appearing and this was picked up on by the serving staff who apologised for the wait. Most efficient.

I would love to tell you that we had a wonderful time, sitting in the garden admiring the view with sandwiches and a pint, but we didn't even get to order. Arrived at 12pm, most of the tables were empty. I waited a few minutes to be served at the bar, and asked if it would be ok to eat in the garden as I was confused why there was a sign saying that food was only served on the small terrace - why would we want to sit there, crowded with nasty metal tables, when there's a beautiful pub garden to enjoy? The lady behind the bar asked if I had made a reservation, to which I had replied that I hadn't. I was then told, very firmly, that those who had booked got priority. Fine, we only want sandwiches and I understand if the kitchen is busy, I said, thinking a packet of crisps would tide us over. How long is the wait? ""Even sandwiches take time,"" said the woman behind the bar like I was some kind of idiot, ""and there are FIVE tables to give their orders before you!"" What? They haven't even ordered? How is the kitchen busy? I don't think they had even arrived! It was the beginning of service, they weren't busy. I left with my family, without ordering anything. I've never been greeted in such an inhospitable manner when going to a pub, especially by the person who I assume is the landlady. She should have advised, politely and with a smile, that there would be a bit of a wait as they were busy, but asked what I wanted to drink - it's a pub, afterall! But, nope. Years spent waitressing has made me more sympathetic than most, but I was made to feel like my custom wasn't wanted. Thousands of pubs across the land manage lunchtime service, and of course on busy days there will probably be a wait, but there was no excuse for the treatment we received today. The staff were rude, service is a shambles - it was chaos behind the bar already, and all these unnecessary rules to help them cope with serving food goes to show how incompetent they are at running a pub. Such a shame, it is a beautiful location - a pub that I fondly remember from my childhood.

Called and booked a table a few days previously, but when we arrived we were told they didn’t have the table reservation which was frustrating, as they insinuated that I didn’t call to make a booking. After a bit of flapping between waitresses and the manager, he waved his hand to a free table for us. We ordered a selection of tapas and mezze dishes from the menu, and they all came out quickly and freshly cooked. We very much enjoyed them all and asked the waitress if we could order more (the portion sizes are small for the price). At this point a waiter/the manager whispered something to the waitress and he said to us that having a second lot of food out will delay things, and he said it in a manner which could be construed as them not wanting us to order more and that it was an inconvenience. It’s also worth noting that we asked two servers what they recommend for portion sizes for our table, which they didn’t actually answer, so it was hard to gauge how much to order. The second lot of tapas came out quickly, and again was fresh and delicious. When the waiter came to clear the table, we asked for the bill. A few minutes later he put the dessert menu on our table. A further 15 minutes passed and we flagged down a passing waitress and asked for the bill again. We waited for 20 minutes to pay, and in the end gave up and went to the bar on the way out to pay. I asked to speak to the manager to give some face-to-face feedback regarding our visit. I explained that we absolutely loved the food and the food service was quick, but their very flippant customer service manner was not appreciated with regards to ordering further food. He then kept repeating that the food is cooked fresh and there can be delays. I explained again this is not what I was telling him, and even said to him “you’re not even listening to me”, to which he nodded and smiled...because he wasn’t listening. Entirely rude and I will not be returning due to this. The food was lovely and prepared quickly, but was overpriced for what it was (nearly £6 for 4 prawns is a rip off in my eyes!) Disappointed with the end to a lovely meal. We did leave a small tip, which I also pointed out to the manager who still wasn’t actually listening to what I was saying.

We were welcomed by friendly staff, beautiful interior and a roaring fire. This is exactly what we needed after a long day.
Service from start to finish was excellent. Staff were attentive and friendly. The food was absolutely delicious. I had scollops to start, roast turkey and sticky toffee pudding. It was all cooked to perfection. We came with another couple and everyone commented how delicious their food was.
We spoke to the lovely owners who were both charming. It was wonderful to see how passionate they were about their beautiful pub.
We also found out that all their food is locally sourced which is amazing.
The atmosphere was relaxed and friendly. It has been a long time since we’ve had such an enjoyable night.

1699,4848,Arundel,1,"Staff So Rude! Having heard that the management had changed hands we were keen to give this restaurant another go. Having read recent reviews about the food and experience we were optimistic that we'd have a local restaurant to add to our regular places to go for a sunday lunch. Admittedly we hadn't booked, but our general experience with the local pubs is that you dont need to but you may need to wait for food which is totally fine with us.
We arrived at 1.15pm to find there were 2 tables with shade available in the garden. Brilliant! We went into the bar area to ask whether we could have a menu (there's only waitress service inside and not outside, which was fine) The young lady that was behind the bar had stated there would be a 30 minute wait for food which we had said was totally fine. We were happy to wait for food whilst we had drinks. If I'm honest the way she responded made us feel like we had put her nose out of joint that we'd even asked about food. She then repeated that there would be a 30 minute wait... to which I said that was fine. She seemed surprised it was ok. But in all honesty I was happy we had found somewhere that we could get a table at without booking. I asked my partner whether he picked up on the frostyness and he completely agreed. Anyway after shaking it off, we got our toddler settled into the high chair and chose our food. Only to find that when we then went back into the bar to order food and drinks that the young lady said we couldn't order until 30 minutes time! It is the most absurd thing I have ever heard in terms of a service!! I completely understand that you may need to wait after ordering.... but to have to wait to ORDER.... is baffling! She was so abrupt I was so taken back. The most frustrating part of this was that the manager was not interested in even facing us to speak to us. We were not worthy of her attention. In fact I'm not sure if anyone was. I am gutted because it has potential to be great. No matter how good food is, Service is key and there's no point having staff that dont have any customer service skills. I am disgusted at how we were spoken to.

The irony is that we headed up to the Village Inn, they were just as busy as the black horse. We got the last table in the garden, we ordered, the staff so friendly and our food was on the table all within 15 minutes.

The decor is cosy and welcoming, the food plentiful, they were flexible, well staffed and courteous. It’s also so close to the Crematorium that it was easy and convenient for friends and family alike.

The landlady, Jen gave us a personal service, taking the time to show us how part of the pub would be reserved and advised dad on the numbers to cater for. Jen was sensitive to our needs and offered a lot of flexibility in the menu options. On the day, the turnout was much bigger than we had expected and originally catered for, but the pub managed seamlessly.

Even the weather proved a test, with a heavy shower and sunshine. With the layout, we were able to be accommodated inside and then, as the sun broke through, we could spill out into the front garden. The kids were also looked after, because Jen opened the skittle alley, which kept them amused, while we chatted.

A funeral is a time of great stress, but Jen and the team at The Black Horse were absolutely first-class. Our guests had a great time, we reminisced, shared stories, laughed and cried and gave mum a send-off of which she would have been proud.

If anything we thought the food was better than last year with the lamb roast at £13.95 being on the top end of pub prices but very enjoyable. We did have to choose our menu in advance which is takes a bit of sorting out but then each couple simply went to the bar and paid for the two meals while ordering their drinks.

The outlook from the pub terrace is onto the road, but it is sstill quiet and surrounded by lovely buildings. Coupled with this the publicans have done a great job with flowers, so it still had a great feel.

The sun finally disappeared behind a tree at 8pm, and we went inside. And again we greated to a surprising interior. Far more modern than I was expecting, but still felt inviting.

The food was great, but beware... prices are relatively high, but as long as you know this beforehand you will not be shocked at the bill (I have included the current menu within pictures to give you a flavour of what is on offer and the cost).

We had a sharing fish platter to start, followed by steak, and both were a treat.

The seafood platter (£19) would have been quite enough for my husband, myself and my daughter if we had ordered a couple of portions of chips though!

Overall a wonderful evening, which could only have been topped off with slightly more attentive hosting.

2095,5423,Littlehampton,1,"Weird  Weird experience, not quite sure what the market is for them - advertise tapas which is Spanish for food and talk...the food wasn’t remotely Spanish - too much oil (it’s not portugal).

The food is so varied - burgers and other mains you may as well go elsewhere because it’s better value for money for the quality.

Staff weren’t the passionate exciting staff I’m used to in other “tapas” USP bars. They looked bored.

The catchment market and the people that go there don’t match the atmosphere, the housy style music for the “entitled” youngsters that feel they’re important in there doesn’t equate the the clientele that sit there in the day paying for over priced coffee like costa.

Considering I’m never in the UK but this place is an example of why I hate being here so much and rather travel to authentic real places - won’t be returning any time soon, weird atmosphere, weird concept and the clientele ruin the place.

A real Spanish tapas and wine bar would be a great catch in Rustington - the clientele is there for it - just seems like the leakage from the lamb down the other end has come here for a “exquisite” setting

Good points however,
Layout, open spread out and comfortable
Great seating, felt cosy and warm

The food isn't amazing, but you could get some simple tapas and enjoy a glass of wine and have a good evening. I don't know if the chefs have changed or if it simply depends who is working that night, but the quality of the food varies from visit to visit. Sometimes a dish like harissa and courgettes and halloumi will be tangy and spicy with a lot of sauce, other times it will have no spice or sauce at all. The wine is expensive - it seems extraordinary to charge £25.50 for a cheap bottle of prosecco - especially when at the other end of the street they charge £9.99 for a very similar bottle. The tables are filthy and sticky, nobody ever seems to clean them.

Unfortunately another customer then sees an empty free table and sits down and then realised it was dirty and sticky but no staff members to be seen as I suppose they had picked up some glasses so they could relax again and wait for more to appear. I note the management have made a previous comment that they are trying to get staff to wipe up. Please give them and apron with front pockets to carry a spray, cloth and wipes so they have no excuse not to think that if they pick up a glass they can clean at the same time so the next customer gets a seat at a clean table. Unfortunately the female staff member did her same nonchalant non caring practice at three different tables in 45 minutes between 6.30 and 7.15 last Friday. Shouldn’t be that hard to identify her??

First impressions were of somewhere done up, this can be a warning bell for me and another was the bill for the cheapest fixed menu lunch (2 courses), around £56 for two with one drink each. Anyway I managed to maintain the requisite stiff upper lip. And the interiors were actually quite nice. The welcome I would describe as polite rather than warm; then again, maybe we were a bit on the scruffy side!

Food came in reasonable time and was presented quasi nouvelle style, not something I usually particularly favour, but this was done nicely and nothing too fussy.

We really began to warm to the place on tasting the food, which was excellent throughout. My starter of mackerel Caesar salad was really fresh (...& that certainly tells with mackerel), with the anchovies done whitebait style and salty lardons. Mains of sea bass included a generous size whole fish each, cooked to absolute perfection with just the right touch of garlic, a few new potatoes and a delicious side salad. We didn't do desert as we couldn't afford to sleep all afternoon with miles to walk, but the coffee & amaretti was equally decent with real flavour.

When we got there a member of staff asked us if we were there for food or just drinks, we said just drinks, she said that's fine, and showed us to a table. We ordered two hot chocolates that came after about 10 minutes.
The band were setting up, all was fine,
Then one of the members of staff came over just as i had my last mouthful of my drink, she bent down next to our table and asked us to move because some customers had come in. I thought that rather odd as we were also customers and it was only a small table so not as if we were using a table that a larger group would want.

Oh yeah yours is out next, so five minutes not 20. It actually was 10. When it arrived, my burger that was described as mildly spiced was hot spice, and cold in temperature. So we complained and they offered to make another. My granddaughter took a bite of hers, and again it was cold and pink in the middle.

Food wise, the burger I had (Holy Fire Burger) was good but not great. It was well flavoured but the meat wasn’t the most tasteful. I had the skin-on fries on the side which weren’t bad.
Pricing was definitely a bit excessive for what it was and more that I would have expected.

Pretty food, good wine list and friendly, attentive staff.

However I had the set menu and I did at the time comment to my dinner companions as to how long they could keep it at the very good price level it was.
I was not going to write a review, and am still not going to. But would like to comment on the review about the set menu prices going up 12%. The reply by the owners was clear and distinct and put the case very well. However it did miss one very salient point that all restaurants, pubs etc have to cope with on top of rising food prices, utility prices, business rates etc. That is that we tend to forget, as it is included normally in the price in the UK that 20% of what you pay goes to the government in VAT. So if you have the set meal at £22.95 then £4.59 is going straight to the government. Yes you can claim VAT back but in the restaurant business very little ! am told. We have one of the highest VAT rates in Europe for hospitality.
I am not a regular visitor to Bognor Regis but one of the things that you do notice as opposed to some of the dare I say it 'posher' places is the lack of restaurant chains.
If you have independents whether they be restaurants, bars, pubs, cafes or any business you should use them or lose them!
Business is incredibly tough at the moment and if you still think Mars Bars are 10p or you can get a well cooked three course meal for less than £20 well you are about 10 years behind the times.

We were pleasantly surprised by the breadth of the menu and indeed the early evening fixed price menu at £17.95 had a good choice with a £3 supplement for an 8oz Sirloin steak. The wine list provided a good choice and range with good price points.

A selection of warm bread was served to the table while we were waiting accompanied by a choice of three dips/tapenades. A starter of Hot Salmon and crab salad was exceptional, presented beautifully seasoned to perfection and full of flavour (had thought it was going to be standard chilled fare so was very pleasantly surprised).

2632,6207,Bognor,3,"Good food but ........ First the positives: really good food (calves liver, boeuf bourguignon, and lemon brulee); service was also good - very prompt and polite; nice colour scheme.

Now the negatives: sounds like a cafeteria - needed more soft furnishings to tone the noise level down; two tables (or 1 table of 4) too many - as people walked through they were knocking things off other tables or seated customers had to move their chairs; you can't add a tip to a card payment - not everyone carries cash so the staff will lose out with this.

Finally, this restaurant has promise as the fundamental aspect (the food) is good, it is just the environment that lets it down. The choice of colours is lovely but the paint is already scuffed in places, the door to the toilet corridor barely opens and the toilet area itself is not brilliant (stains on walls etc.). They have tried to do a classy look but on a tight budget, and it shows.

Hopefully if the food stays good then they can make enough profit to afford to improve the environmental issues and add wallpaper & curtains - both of which will stop the sound bouncing around the restaurant. And they need to sort out the tipping mechanism otherwise their staff will miss out on rewards for good service.",negative sound like cafeteria needed soft furnishing tone noise level two table table many people walked knocking thing table seated customer move chair not add tip card payment not everyone carry cash staff lose,tone noise level,"['tone', 'noise', 'level']",Service

It was very busy which is always a good sign but we found somewhere to sit overlooking the River Arun. We were given menus very quickly and ordered drinks while we looked at the menu. The couple behind us were eating roast dinners which looked and smelt amazing but unfortunately we’d arrived late in the day and the roasts had all sold out. We ordered 2 crab sandwiches from a lovely lady called Sharyn instead and waited eagerly for our food. Some moments later Sharyn came back to our table and informed us there was some roast potatoes left over and asked if we would like them! What fantastic service! Our crab sandwiches were made and brought out promptly - beautifully presented with crisps and a side salad, along with some wonderfully fluffy piping hot crispy roast potatoes! Cracking!

As always we tend to look for a different place to visit when roaming for something to eat and do some country driving at the same time. A quick look on TA highlighted Partners as a very good place to visit so we thought, why not! We weren't disappointed, managed to find a parking spot right outside, got a nice comfortable table that became available just as we walked in and greeted by staff within a minute of arriving. The decor has a very personal touch to it with authentic low beams and varying levels, tall people (like me) mind your noddle!

The menu is plentiful and quite varied but this time we went for the set breakfasts. Our order was taken and advised that it may take a little longer to serve the food due to the sudden influx of customers. Despite that, after ordering (and having the order checked that we had all options available) the food arrived within 5 minutes and was plentiful, hot, very tasty and quite frankly superb. An additional drink was ordered whilst eating and that arrived with a few minutes as well (marshmallow & cream hot chocolate, the boss said they were outstanding (and had two!)).

To summarise, Partners is well well worth a visit if you're in Arundel, you might not be as lucky as we were in parking and getting a table so quick but I can assure you any wait would be worthwhile. They do have a few breakfast bar type seats and a very comprehensive takeaway menu as well for on the go food. And if you want to pass the time there are dominos and solitaire sets available.

1. Staff were friendly and the food was generally good. However, my husband ordered the beef, medium rare, and it came very well done. We didn't want to make a fuss but we thought it worth saying something to the waitress, especially as the beef cost about £28. The waitress apologised and explained that they would redo the beef. Unfortunately, despite eating very slowly, I had finished my meal long before the replacement arrived for my husband. A number of staff apologised for the delay, but nothing more was done. My husband ordered another glass of wine and the waitress said that this would be on the house, which was nice, but by then I had already finished my meal and my husband had to eat alone. The beef was good, but not amazing. The portion of tomatoes on his replacement meal was much smaller. The chips were replaced but the side of beans that my husband had ordered and had put onto his plate were not replaced. We didn't want to spoil the evening and so didn't say anything but we thought that a reduction might have been applied to the bill given the delay. At the end of the meal, there was no discount to the bill which came to over £70 for two mains, one side, one pudding and two glasses of wine. We found this disappointing.
2. My parents felt disappointed as they had recommended the restaurant to us and my mum went in a few days later to express her disappointment at the situation. She was told that it was standard to simply replace the meal if something was wrong and was told that she would receive a call from the manager. She left her contact details but has heard nothing since.

This place is noisy beyond tolerance. Bare white plastered walls, no tableclohs and music blaring in the restaurant from the bar. It is noisy with absolutely no ambience. It is impossible to have a conversation without shouting accross the tightly packed tables. I have had quieter meals in burger chains on kids birthdays.
Yes on arrival we were greeted at the door and ushered to our table whereupon we were asked if we wanted to order wine before we had sat down. very pushy.
Instantly had the feeling of being ""processed"" not welcomed.
A waitress brought menu's and again asked if we wanted to order wine before we had seen the drinks menu. We declined saying we would choose drinks to go with our meal.
She returned and asked again!
Eventually we ordered. First we got Bruscetta as one dish which was a whole pannini with vey little strips of pepper and beetroot with 1 tiny anchovy, I had 3 of the smallest sardines you have ever seen.
On complaint we were told that this was the chef's interpretaion of what a Bruscetta might be......not an actual bruscetta (and nothing like that shown on their web site)
For mains we had a sea trout fillet (average but not special) and I ordered the Chicken breast with pancetta and crushed new potatoes and""greens"". What I got was a minute chicken breast About 1/3 supermarket size with two very small new potatoes and some long strands of green vegitables that I can only deduce to be cabbage. I could not tell. There was no pancetta but there was a hard brown golf ball size lump of something that i assumed was the stuffing. it was inedble.
A waitress asked if the meal was ok but did not pause for a reply so I called her back. I complained about my meal and our accompanying garlic ciabatta that was again just pannini . She was happy to stand and argue with me her main defences being that 1. they had never had complaints before and 2. the ciabatta is what their supplier sends them ( does their chef not order his supplies? or is it a case of anything will do for the punters?)
They took my meal away and replaced it with what was described as ""veal Milanese. I could go on for hours but by now I had lost faith that they new anything about what they were serving up. There were breadcrumbs (not parmesan) over cooked and burnt around the edes covering some tough, tasteless, dark brown meat. I have never seen veal that colour before.
We ordered coffee and left.
This was supposed to be a nice meal out to celebrate our wedding aniversary. It was a thow back to the 1970's. poor menu, poorly cooked food, over attentive ""pushy"" service

From the minute we were warmly welcomed into the restaurant,we knew this would be a special meal. The warm sharing platter for starter was delightful with a good selection of tasty bites and a delicious tomato salsa gave it a real burst of Italy. The mains were special too with my Fillet of beef cooked to perfection and full of flavour. My wife had the fish of the day,which was a seafood linguine with giant prawns and crab to die for. Although stuffed, we had to have the full experience of an Italian desert. The semifreddo with hazelnut centre and my wife's baked ricotta and mascarpone tart with chocolate and orange were well worth making room for. Finally,the wine list was compact and offered enough choice for each course.

The starters were ok. My sons Penne pasta dish was bland which is not what you expect from Arribaita. We (my wife and I) ordered the Fillet steak rare. It wasn't but rather than complain on what was suppose to a celibration of 28 years of marriage, we perceivered. The steak was dry and over powered by the truffle oil which totally ruined it. After about 3/4 of the steak I gave up as did my wife. The so called Grosse Fries looked like they'd come from a Macains frozen bag and were anything but Grosse. When the proprieter asked how it was I replied ""do you want the truth2 and she said yes. I was somewhat supprised we she said there wasn't truffle oil on the dish! My taste buds and the other staff said differently. We were given a Lemoncello as a concellation, didn't enjoy that much either. We should've complained much sooner but as I said this was our aniversary and quite frankly if you can't cook a fillet steak you shouldn't be working in a kitchen especially one that costs £27.50.

On arrival there is an ambience of class and professionalism. The decor is very modern but somehow maintains the feel of a family restaurant. We were welcomed warmly and shown to our table, the seating is very comfortable and I immediately felt relaxed.
Our drinks order was taken quickly whilst we perused the menu, a good selection of wines and beers and nice to see Harvey's Sussex ale included. We were very pleased with the kids eat free on Sundays offer and a good choice for vegetarians compared with many other restaurants.
I had the Penne Arrabiata with Italian sausage, my Wife and Mum both chose the Pea Risotto and my Dad went for the Seafood Pizza. All of the food was well presented, looked appetising and tasted great, I must say that next time I go I'll be having the Rump of Beef with Parmesan Yorkshire's and seasonal veg, a lot of other customers were having that and it looked fantastic.
For desert most of us went for the Tiramisu and we were not disappointed, probably the best one I have ever tasted, if it wasn't polite company I would have literally licked the bowl clean!
All in all a lovely family lunch in a lovely family restaurant, plenty of families with kids, a convivial atmosphere, friendly and professional staff and the best surprise of all reasonably priced.

The restaurant was nicely appointed with tasteful decor & furnishings & the young lady who greeted us was pleasant & friendly. Our drinks order was taken & delivered promptly but my partner had to ask for a glass with ice in for her sparkling water. The menu was just extensive enough without being too daunting. I had the arancini starter to share. This consisted of three different types of breaded risotto balls & was delicious. For my main course I picked the rump steak with parmesan fries. This was nicely cooked to my preference & was served with a salsa type sauce on. I felt this dish would have benefited from being served with a few more vegetables rather than rely on you ordering extra sides. For dessert I had a lovely panna cotta & a double espresso which rounded things off nicely.

3134,7023,Bognor,4,"Nice location, ambiance and service, acceptable food. So 4 of use ate at Finos recently. We had the seafood platter to share for starters, and a crab bruschetta starter. For mains we had the crab risotto, a pizza, and the breaded chicken, with egg and chips. Desert just had one chocolate tart with the mascapone. Came to around 100 pounds with drinks.

Restaurant was really nice and clean, nice lighting and general ambiance. Toilets nice and clean and modern. Staff were friendly and nice. Trying to do a fair honest review so its actually meaningful and constructive.

Drinks order was done reasonably quickly. Took a perhaps a while to place our food order, not long enough that it was bad, but just a bit too long. After order was made food came out in good time, with about the right gap between starter and main.

Starter. The seafood platter, tasted reasonably good. Breaded whitebait, and calamari in a bowl with some tartar style source. It was ok. decent. the seafood perhaps lacked the wow factor, but it was not bad. tasted reasonably fresh. just needed perhaps some more flavours or choice of dips. the crab bruschetta. Was a bit disapointing. Again not really bad. But the bread (panninni or something) was just a bit soft and tasteless, the crab layer didnt really have much flavour, it was just a bit bland. Not like really tasty, hard to describe. but not bad. not unpleasent.

The mains. The pizza which was just cheese and tomato. The quality of the pizza base was nice, and sort of seemed like good fresh dough. the cheese and tomato sauce had a good fresh flavor. but it lacked real flavor beyond just tomato and cheese was generally a bit bland (not a major problem for the kids menu). Also the bottem of the pizza had little black bits on it. the base was not burnt, but it had little black bits from where it sat in the oven, and these sort of gave a strong bitter charcoal flavor which was the overwhelming taste.

The crab risotto. This looked good, the texture of the risotto was good. But it had a really strong, overpowering flavor of aniseed? or something like this, maybe fennel. First spoon you notice it and you can not really taste anything else. But it became a bit sickly quickly. Again its was not really bad. but it was not great.

The Bread crumb chicken with a fried egg on top and chips. The chicken tasted fresh, the bread crumbs were fresh, it was hand made. It was not dry. the bread crumbs where a little bit greasy. and theres was no other real flavour going on apart from the chicken. but I thought it was pretty good. Fried egg on top. Fine. chips were good too. It just felt a bit like the sort of thing I make at home, tasty but a bit bland perhaps. I also thought the truffle source was properly vile, so glad it was in a little jar on its own it would have ruined the meal. but everyone else thought it was delicious and stole it :) thats a personal taste thing i think.

Desert. The chochlate tarte with mascapone, with little chocholate sticks in it. the flavour was great. the nice creamy mascapone, with sweet chocolate sticks. However the chocolate tart was bullet hard, I literally could not break it with a ton of force, it was so tough and when it broke it would shatter and fly off the plate. perhaps needed more balance was a lot of mascapone with just a very thin tart. but it tasted really nice.

Thats it. Im trying to be really honest. Would we go back. Yes. I think the restaurant has good intentions and is trying to serve good food and it felt nice in there, and we had a good time. The food was hmm.. It was ""ok"" better than average restaurants in the area. But there were big flaws with the food. Proper ""foodies"" would have been upset by some of these mistakes.

3151,7034,Bognor,1,"An anniversary ruined Now to be fair the waitress acted responsibly throughout.
The Aperol Spritz despite instructions on the back of every bottle was terrible the recommended 3 parts prosecco, 2 parts aperol and 1 part soda included at least 10 parts soda if any prosecco at all.
The rump steak was not rare as requested but well done and chewy but the worst was the under-cooked fish on the point of raw, concealed within a wrap of pancetta. This any chef will know is very dangerous and can lead to anisakiasis a parasitic disease caused by anisakid nematodes(worms) invading the stomach wall of humans. Offering to cook it again or replace it with something else just doesn't cut it when you are already beginning to doubt the ability of the establishment.
The waitress offered to replace the Aperol Spritz and took it off the bill. The fish course was also deducted but they left the uneaten fries on £3.

So half eaten steak and half bottle of wine consumed whilst waiting ad nauseum for food is a lousy way of spending an anniversary or any other celebration so I would recommend finding somewhere else that genuinely cares about quality.

Staffing levels were refreshingly plentyful and this meant great and efficient service with a smile, this place is run by members of the Macari family - a family who have supported the local community in Bognor for years - this is a great new venture for them, we had drinks, a bottle of wine and three courses - all for £86 which was outstanding value.

Puddings were also homemade which I hadn’t expected ordering sticky toffee pudding. It was as light as a feather and sinfully sticky and my partner’s frangipani tart was also good.

3276,7270,Littlehampton,4,"Needs a change in management Me and my family have come to this pub\restraunt many times before, especially last summer. However they seem to have a huge change over of staff every time we visit. Last summer they had a great team who knew what they were doing, the food was always great and served quickly. The floor staff were always kind and willing to go the extra mile to ensure we had a good visit, which is surprising considering how the management always spoke to them and treated them in front of customers. As someone who has owned their own business, I would never think to speak or treat staff the way they do. The only familiar faces we encountered last Saturday was a young lad and brown haired woman behind the bar, who are both always smiling and polite. The new staff( a blonde girl) let the other members of staff do all the work, whilst she stood at the end of the bar talking to a male and female who she obviously knew. Me and my family noticed a few visits ago just how colicky this pub is, either you’re art of it and you matter or you’re not part of it and you don’t matter. This isn’t how a pub should be run, everyone should be made to feel welcome. It’s a shame the business has gone dramatically downhill as my children loved the garden and park in the summer, regardless of them continuously being watched by who we think is the landlady. Overall we were not impressed and will only return if the staff and management change their attitudes and worth ethics, we also will not be recommending this pub.",new staff blonde girl let member staff work whilst stood end bar talking male female obviously knew,member staff work whilst,"['member', 'staff', 'work', 'whilst']",StaffGen

3353,7426,Bognor,5,"Beautiful aesthetic and good food! Let me start of by saying that the aesthetic of this restaurant is on point, they have really hit the nail on the head and have paid attention the detail!

We weren’t entirely sure what to expect food wise, as in the past, I have found American diner style restaurants to be a bit hit and miss. We were served quickly to a nice booth, where the table and booth were nice and clean and laid out. If you got an American Diner i feel it is a must to see if they’re milkshakes are any good. I went for a strawberry milkshake which is made with 4 scoops of ice cream. It was DIVINE. It looked incredible and tasted even better! I really liked the fact that they make it to order as well because they state that it is made with 4 scoops of ice cream, they bring you over in a metal cup whatever is left over - not that I drank any left overs as it was very filling

I made my own burger (one of the options they have) which had crispy chicken, bacon and lettuce in it. It was really delicious and if you like chicken burgers, I recommend you try this or something similar.
My mum, who is a vegetarian ordered one of their Veggie Mountain which is a vegetarian burger that I’m pretty certain included halloumi and mushroom. It was absolutely huge but she said that it was delicious and she would recommend it to anyone going for a veggie option.
My dad went for New York Strip (pretty certajn) which was cooked how he liked - rare and loved too.
All meals came with chips, although I changed mine to sweet potato chips - can never go wrong with chips! Plus, these chips were so good!
My 22 month old son ate off the tots menu and had chicken goujons & chips which he enjoyed!

It would be rude to not have a dessert so I went for the Apple Pie and Ice Cream and my dad went for the New York Cheesecake. I didn’t particularly like the Apple Pie, there was nothing wrong with it as my parents liked it, I just think it was a bit to tart for me. My dads cheesecake was gorgeous apparently, so gorgeous that he wouldn’t let anyone else try any!

Lastly, I really recommend you make a reservation on your first night at Butlins if you want to Dine Here as this place gets booked up very quickly and you don’t want to be left disappointed or with a long wait.",really liked fact make order well state made scoop ice cream bring metal cup whatever left not drank left over filling made burger one option crispy chicken bacon lettuce,option crispy chicken bacon lettuce,"['option', 'crispy', 'chicken', 'bacon', 'lettuce']",FoodPort

3370,7459,Bognor,2,Disappointing and frsutrating We were disappointed and frustrated after coming to the Diner yesterday whilst at Butlins. We were looking for somewhere to have lunch and had previously been in the Diner for milkshakes earlier in our holiday and thought it looked like a good place to have lunch. However after picking our food from the lunch menu and looking forward to our food we were told we should not have been given the lunch menu as the previous day there had been such a delay getting the orders out from the lunch menu so they were not offering it yesterday!!!.. my husband and I were very annoyed as by this point we had all drank our drinks and made our choices and instead of having a reasonably priced lunch now only had the option to pick something from the main menu which was much more expensive and our disappointment and frustration meant we did not fancy anything from the main menu but felt it too late to leave even though I very much wanted to just pay for our drinks and leave and find somewhere else. So we made another choice and ordered the children their meals and were all disappointed with our food. My son ended up his tears he disliked his meal so much as the pulled beef in his taco's (which were supposed to be make your own but came already made up) was so spicy he spent most of the time soaking his tongue in his water and my daughter left most of hers as she said her chips were awful and the burger not much better. I ended up giving most of my dinner to the children so they had something to eat and got the bill leaving with a bitter taste in my mouth of the whole experience and paying £46 for some lunch!..

3492,7651,Bognor,3,"Two visits in one weekend! We visited this restaurant twice over the course of our weekend and after the first visit agreed we'd rate it 4. I had ham, egg & chips and my partner had scampi & chips. For dessert we had the Eton mess and crème brulee respectively. I really enjoyed both my courses, whilst my other half also enjoyed his but perhaps didn’t think it anything extraordinary. The service and staff friendliness was good and the price reasonable.

Sadly our second visit was not as successful. Admittedly we did visit on a Sunday – a busy day for the restaurant – but it was at 4:30pm when we imagined the main lunchtime rush would have subsided. We are very patient and not overly bothered if we’re kept waiting for a while so long as we have drinks, but this meal took well over an hour and people arrived after us, were served their meals and had paid their bills all before our main course arrived! On this second occasion my other half had the salmon on a bed of baby potatoes and whilst the salmon was “OK” (not exceptional), the potatoes were apparently hard, so that was disappointing. By the time we’d eaten our main course we couldn’t spare the time for a dessert, so went without the lovely Eton mess! Again, I know Sunday is a busy day, but if a restaurant has the tables to accommodate a large number of guests I feel it assumes it can cope with serving them all.

This won’t put me off eating here again. It’s a good addition to the resort (a step up from the other Butlin's offerings) and is something the resort needs. The staff do try hard but sadly it scores 3 on this occasion for the very slow service on the Sunday and the hard potatoes. Hopefully next time I can give it a higher rating.",know sunday busy restaurant table accommodate large number guest feel assumes cope serving,busy restaurant table accommodate,"['restaurant', 'table', 'accommodate']",Ordering

Ordered food which again took ages,was frustrating as the staff were stood around chatting to two friends who had popped in

I ordered the venison burger. Which to be fair was OK. But had salad on the side which tasted really odd

Friend I was with ordered mixed kebab. There was no lamb so was just chicken and pork. This was inedible. The meat was so dry it could not be eaten

Thought long and hard about eating here as it’s not got the magic 5 rating on the government food agency site, but in the end we decided to try it.

We didn’t get off to a great start as the first tonic water wasn’t too lively, so it went back. The second was better but whatever brand they use it certainly not Schweppes or Fever Tree!

We chose a mixture of starters and main courses.

Portion size was generous.

The big mistake I made was to order a Naga (spicy) dish but rather than lamb or chicken which was on the menu at £9, I asked for king prawn.

When the dish arrived it had exactly 4 king prawns in it, along with about a pint of Naga sauce.

I did mention this but the waiter just said “they are king prawns and it’s not on the menu”.

I also chose garlic naan. It came literally dripping with garlic sauce (or melted garlic butter), I poured it off but it was just about inedible.

The rest of the food was ok. King prawn balti (with a sensible number of prawns!). Plus quite a few veg dishes that were also ok.

The bill arrived and my 4 prawn dish had cost a whopping £14. Again I moaned but they just shrugged their shoulders.

Left pretty disgusted, and wouldn’t go back there I’m afraid.

Dropped fellow guests and went to park.

Enquire about table - “it is being prepared”.
After 15 minutes - “it is being prepared”.
Is there a table? “Did you make a booking?”
Book showed we are one of three bookings - clearly our table has been given away.
Offer to have take-away. “No”.
Get to table at last. No one to take order.
Eventually food arrives - but our main courses. Where are our starters?
Hopefully you get the picture - chaos!
We did start to eat eventually. However allowing all the guests to arrive at the same time is asking for trouble. Of course the kitchen and the waiters can’t cope.
It would have been so simple to have said “No, we have no table reserved for you. No, we can’t serve you very soon, No, you will have to wait and No we can’t serve a takeaway as the kitchen is unable to cope.
We would have gone somewhere else but returned on another day.
The food is good, the waiter was sorry and able to laugh with us and was appologetic.

For a starter I had calamari - the best I can remember - cooked in a light fresh batter. If you've been shunning this dish of late because it always tastes and feels like tough rubber, then please give it another chance here. It was faultless. To follow I chose the fish of the day - a fillet of sea bass. It was perfectly cooked and served on a bed of french beans and asparagus. Upon request a few saute potatoes were added to augment the dish. For pudding I had one of three homemade fruit pies on offer, served with ice cream or cream. To accompany the fish I had a glass of Sicilian dry white wine., which had lots of flavour and no harshness.
All-in-all it was a fabulous, tasty meal - leaving one feel nicely fed but not stuffed - and all for a very reasonable price. The quality of the cuisine could have come from a kitchen charging 50% more - if indeed you can find it.

The duration was confirmed at one hour.
On arrival we were given literally a few seconds to choose a colour of varnish and told not to bother with the swatch book as all the colours were not available.
Then to my surprise my daughter and I were taken off to separate rooms. I obviously questioned this and to my surprise was told that they did not have the facility to do two people together.
The pedicure was done lying down so would be difficult to drink wine or a cuppa.
,there was no option of gel polish and I was told we needed an extra 45 minutes at the end of the treatment for the nail polish to dry.
After painting the first foot, the beautician commented that the polish was nearly finished and was too thick. She said that she had no more and then poured something in to dilute it.
After the pedicure I was directed to a room to wait for the polish to dry. It was dark and cold with no heating on.
I can honestly say that this was not the pampering luxury visit I’d hoped for, and paid for.

The order was placed online, on their website, at 5.15pm but knew they didn’t open until 5.30pm. Selected delivery time between 6pm to 6.30pm which included a £1.00 delivery for some reason, the website says free delivery for orders over £18. Come 6.30pm it still hadn’t arrived so gave them a call. Not ready they said. Probably another 15 minutes. We weren’t impressed so said we would go and collect. On arrival at the shop we were told it still wasn’t ready so we waited patiently. After another 10 minutes I insisted on collecting the food. Again told that it wasn’t ready and would we like free drinks while waiting. Absolutely not. At this point I said don’t bother and I wanted a refund. Nobody knew what to do including the manager who made an appearance with our food. Again I declined the food and insisted on a refund. To rub salt in to the wound he said I had to ring a number to get a refund as he didn’t know how to do it! Miraculously, on advising him that I would be happy to take cash, he denied having any cash in the till, then proceeded to pick up the card terminal and process my refund!!!

The setting of the Hotel is most pleasant and the Tapestry Restaurant is much as you would expect, giving the impression of being within a building of great history and character. Only two other tables were occupied but snow was all around so not too surprising it was not busier. However this did mean that we all tended to speak in whispers and I prefer a more buzzy ambience.

Just three choices for starters, mains and desserts plus a tasting menu @ £45 with more courses but no choice. Portions a little more generous than other similar ""fine dining"" establishments, I had a proper bowl of soup, home baked warm bread accompanied. Dishes were well presented and cooked, service was friendly and prompt but my side order of sugar snap peas did not appear until I had already consumed three quarters of the dish placed before me so this did not impress considering just 6 people dining.

Good wine list, reasonable choice by the glass although the one I especially fancied was in the Special Section and I could not justify paying £15 for a glass as a poor OAP.

Prices generally in line for what you would expect for an hotel/restaurant of this nature. The voucher gave good value. A plus point is that they do not put a ""discretionary"" service charge on the bill, they suggest instead amounts based on either 10 or 15% but this does at least give the opportunity to reflect what has happened, the very late arrival of the sugar snap peas for example, without having to be brave and ask for subtraction of a suitable amount..",setting hotel pleasant tapestry restaurant much would expect giving impression within building great history character,setting hotel pleasant tapestry restaurant,"['hotel', 'tapestry', 'restaurant']",Quality

After a good walk we decided to stop for a coffee, then I spotted their special board - Hot Smoked Salmon and poached egg, my all time favourite, but could it compete with the best I’ve had so far down under in NZ.

I ordered sag paneer - which is supposed to be cubes of cheese and spinach with cream, coconut and spices. What was actually served was dire. It was made with normal cheese which melted, so was mushy, with no flavour, at all, (no spices were added) a ton of cream and spinach. I only ate a very small amount, because it was so awful. I have never had sag paneer made with normal cheese, I tried it and regretted it - normal cheese in sag paneer is wrong and lazy.

I also ordered a side of vegetable curry. What I actually got was a bowl of frozen veg - peas, green beans, carrots in what I can only describe as slop. It looked like soup made with frozen veg. I sent that back and they offered a replacement. I declined.

My friend ordered a vegetable shashlic and that was slightly better, because it didn't look like soup and had a bit more flavour. Considering the cost to make with fresh vegetables, it was shocking to see most of ingredients were still obviously from a frozen packet.

(No Quorn curry on offer, which most good restaurants now serve for veggie customers).

The nan was great, perfect.

The rice was ok, hard to get that wrong.

Price for a Sunday Roast (on a Sunday as opposed to midweek) was very good too (£11.95 each or, as in our case, 2 meals for £20). My friend and I like a chat so we stayed for a few more drinks after eating (Service was fast and the server remembered what we were drinking too) and consequently got a bonus of watching a great band (Railroad), so we ended up staying until they finished playing around 7pm; the pub is a supporter of live music so regularly has live music acts playing.

The pub/restaurant is sat directly in the grounds of Butlins, and has been a trusted venue for eats and drinks for some years now during our annual pilgrimages to Butlins holiday camp Adult Weekenders...

During this time we have seen the pub be tastefully redesigned to its current nautically themed state. Very fitting for its location.

The pub clearly has a great deal to offer and this is signalled by its popularity amongst celebrities... Over the years we have seen a raft of individuals ranging from Dan Akroyd and Bill Murray out of Ghostbusters to more recently the bizarre sight of Nick Hancock, Frank Lampard and a grown up Milky Bar kid playing 7 card Brag together whilst tastefully knocking back Cuba Libres - admittedly Frank looked a little overweight and the Milky Bar kid looked a little jaded but it was definitely them..

Now to the food - we'll you won't be disappointed. The pub does a whole range of meals to suit any appetite. If you are unlucky enough to have had to take your mrs along then there are popular classics such as Scampi or if it's a guys outing there are a range of Burgers to accompany those Cuba Libre's whilst youre sat promisingly clutching a prial of aces and a flush on the back hand. The food is always served piping hot, in fact one of our group always refers to the mouthwatering fries as ""hotter than the sun"" so be warned you may wanna lay that back hand before digging in to those delectable fried spuds.

The bar offers inside and outside seating where you can blissfully knock back your soda's or dig into your freshly prepared bacon double cheeseburger, here comes a word of warning though. If eating outside, we have noticed an increasing theme of what can only be describes as ""gull theft"" - turn your back on that delectable burger for one minute and a seagull will swoop in and knock it back faster than Geoff deleting his social media account. We have grown wise to this theme and now deploy a member of our party on ""Gull Watch"" I promise you, there is no way you wanna lose this food especially to a masked winged raider with a beak bigger than Phil Thompson's.

If you are visiting Butlins, this pub is a must. My one tip though is keep your eyes peeled, you never know who you might bump into, it could be Freddie, it could be Boy George, it could be Zorro the Seagull - whoever it is you'll be ""having a good time""",grown wise theme deploy member partygull watchpromise way want lose food especially masked winged raider beak bigger phil thompson is,wise theme deploy member partygull watchpromise way,"['wise', 'theme', 'deploy', 'member', 'watchpromise', 'way']",StaffGen

The food eventually came after waiting 2 hours. This is an extremely long time considering we live within one mile of the takeaway. When it came I had wished it didn’t – it was completely cold and soggy. The crispy Chinese food we enjoy was cold and mushy. The food comes in tinfoil lined bags so it had sweated and gone cold. We microwaved the noodles but as the rest of the food looked a mess so we had to throw it in the bin.
I called the takeaway the following day, not really to complain but to let them know of the poor service I received. The guy told me he will tell the manager and he would get back to me whilst I would likely get 15% off my next order. I never heard back or got an apology from them, hence me writing this review. I wouldn’t go back even with 15% off. I paid £20 for a load of rubbish and the customer service was that of business that simply doesn’t care.

Music playing in the back kitchen where the host (presume Vicky) was at doing nothing in particular. Eventually she came to the front, no hello, no smiley face just a miserable attitude. I ordered a bacon sandwich and a cup of tea. I asked politely for ketchup on the sandwich, then informed “it’s on the table”. I asked for strong tea without sugar, to be told abruptly “sugar on the table and the bag’s left in to sort myself”. It cost £3.50, I only had a £10 note and was rudely asked if I had smaller. I said no and offered a card, then got change and sat at the table. Then the other gent got up and ordered, same attitude and when he asked for crispy bacon was told “obviously that’s going to take longer”.
After a while and relative silence in the restaurant area and muffled music from the back, my sandwich was delivered (nearly thrown on the table). Dry old bread, under cooked bacon and cheap Margarine. Someone else came in during my stay to check if they were open as he’d tried on two previous days to get in and they were shut.

4285,8963,Bognor,5,"Great new addition My mum likes to go somewhere different so today we tried the new restaurant at Charcoal Grill Meze & Bar opposite the station. The environment is great with lovely Turkish furnishings & decorations. Staff are friendly & helpful and the food is great. The chef is from London and everything he made was delicious. We chose from the lunch special menu and had humus & cacik to start followed by vegetarian kebab and mousakka, at £9.99 a head it was great value. To finish we had homemade kemal pasa and Turkish coffee. We felt thoroughly spoilt by the attentive staff and would definitely recommend a visit.",finish homemade kemal pasa turkish coffee,finish homemade kemal pasa turkish coffee,"['homemade', 'pasa', 'coffee']",Choice

Naan breads are filled with what you order it with such as cheese or chicken tikka. Flavors really good and arrives quick.

After spending 48.00 on what was, in essence, a small meal for three people it was disappointing to find such small portions compared to what we are used to with all other local takeaways. 2 large spring rolls that were best described as small to medium, 2 rice in small portion boxes,
 and 2 x sweet and sour dishes in containers 2/3 the size of anywhere else and minum content. I threw away the chicken and sweetcorn soup which had caught so only tasted of burnt sesame oil.

4342,9075,Bognor,1,"Nice food but rude and aggressive staff are a cause for concern The food was as expected but the gentleman serving me was extremely rude, hostile and abrasive. I've eaten here several times but after said incident, my family and I will never return.

I ordered fish and chips and was given a receipt to which I placed in my pocket. The gentleman in question later shouted out ''pie, burger and chips'' directed at me, to which I stated was not my order. he then shouted ''what number'' and I said that I didn't understand.

Now, I've eaten there several times and have never been asked for a number. After a little while, I noticed that my receipt actually had a number on it, so I then presented this to him. The said gentlemen made some very sarcastic and rude comments saying ''this is why we give number to ticket, I say number you no stand there, you tell me number yes''. he continued to yell at me and I couldn't actually speak over the volume of his aggressive tone.

I requested that he is not rude to me and that it's wrong to belittle a customer and speak with sarcasm. I also stated that his tone was unprofessional and that he wasn't clear originally, which caused the confusion. Bizarrely, the gentleman started shouting at me regarding his disabled eye and I have no idea why or what he was trying to say.

I have never before been shouted at by a member of staff as a customer, nor spoken to with such rudeness. It's especially unreasonable because I never spoke out of turn or even raised my voice. I would say that a staff member with such aggression isn't appropriate to employ in a family restaurant.",nice food rude aggressive staff concern food expected gentleman serving extremely rude hostile abrasive,aggressive staff concern food,"['staff', 'concern', 'food']",StaffGen

However my husband, who did not have a starter, struggled to eat all of his cutlets as he was quite hungry. He is not a “foodie” but even he said they were the worst cutlets he had ever eaten.
