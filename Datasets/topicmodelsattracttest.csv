6,9174,Arundel,5,"Family day trip from London Had a wonderful day here. Approaching the castle from a distance is amazing and I was surprised at the size and beautIful gardens. I did not go up to the keep which has 130 steps but photos were taken from the top for me to view. There is a golf cart for transporting visitors up the hill to the formal gardens, fountain and church if unable to walk. Well worth the entry fee. Pretty town to wander in but some streets were quite steep.

14,9182,Arundel,4,"Marvellous Place! For a taste of the old world in all its romantic charm, consider a visit to Arundel, in Southern England, and its famous castle. A preserved work of art with beautiful gardens, the castle sprawls across a hilltop with strategic views, looking almost Disney-esque as one approaches the town. The furnished rooms (part of the castle is still occupied by a duke or earl), including a bed that Queen Victoria slept in, preserve a way of life few of us will ever know. The view of the nearby cathedral through the manicured gardens is also a highlight.

20,9187,Arundel,5,"WOW Visited this beautiful castle in September absolutely loved it we got a ride up to the castle in one of their buggies as the walk up to the castle is fairly steep for anyone with walking difficulties we were dropped off at the castle door excellent.
Inside we were greeted by a very helpful guide who pointed out to us that a lift would take us upstairs to begin our tour we found all the guides to be most helpful and informative they were all a delight to talk to.
The castle is beautifully presented and maintained I couldn’t find a speck of dust and the views from the windows are sublime.
We enjoyed a bite to eat in the restaurant a doorstep bacon sandwich and tea very tasty and served by such happy and pleasant staff.
The gardens are very well kept and a delight to walk round we sat near the glass house for over an hour it was so peaceful the sun was shining which made our day if we lived closer I would be a constant visitor.
Everyone should visit this wonderful place they won’t be disappointed.

I'm not a big fan of museums or visiting old building. But Arundel castle is wonderful. Plan at least two hours to see the castle and the gardens. You can even stay the whole day.

Some of the labels could be clearer for those with poor eyesight and I thought the food and drink was a little expensive however overall it was well worth the entry fee.

32,9203,Arundel,5,"Wonderfully preserved castle, well maintained and an interesting visit Went to this venue as a part of a larger tour, so tickets were presented to my wife and I for all the attractions of the castle and gardens. We started by walking up the fairly steep hill to the gardens which were very well laid out with plants, fruit trees and flowers. Unfortunately it was late season and many flowers were past their best but nevertheless there was plenty to please the eye both outside and in the greenhouses. We used a laid-on buggy to transfer to the castle as it is quite a walk. The tour around the different rooms was very good with much to see for all with an interest in history and art. A very worthwhile place to visit.

Even when I asked one of the staff where all the Knights were and showed her the event photo from the website she at first said that was a different day but then she realised it was this event said ""Um, no it's only actually a few""!. Maybe the wrong photo was used? The ""crafts show"" was in fact one chap sat at a table with a load of jewelery...the Knights bit was 5 chaps doing a demo of fighting for a couple of minutes 4 times spread out over the whole day. And that was it! My two Grandsons enjoyed the fighting and we walked to the Keep. Beware as there are lots of little narrow steps which are quite tricky to negotiate whilst holding a two year old's hand. We have been to other events at Arundel Castle (without the boys) which have been great and we were expecting this one to be similar. Our boys are 5 and 2 so they didn't realise it was a poor show but we did :-( . Our boys were too young to hang around waiting for the whole day so we left. It won't stop us visiting again as the castle is lovely - but pricey to keep going if the events disappoint.

39,9217,Arundel,5,"Tea in the Castle after seeing the BEAUTIFUL Gardens. Recommended to us so we stopped on the way to Gatwick from Southampton. The impressive, well maintained castle set on a hill is the home of the Duke and Duchess of Norfolk. There's a parking lot across the street from the entrance. Our basic Bronze tickets (£13 ea) allowed access to the Fitzalan Chapel, Gardens, Cafe & Gift Shop. Other tickets included the Keep & more of the castle. There were buggys (golf carts) to drive visitors w/ mobility issues up the hill to the gardens & castle. I'm sure that is very much appreciated! It was interesting to see a cork tree on the grounds.

The extensive gardens were absolutely beautiful! With well planned vistas and water features, there was a surprise around every corner. Carefully shaped hedges surrounded the different sections and created a wonderful backdrop for the beautiful flowers. Arbors, fountains & benches were lovely accents. A long archway had apple trees trained over it and was heavy with fruit. Interesting veggies in the kitchen garden. A coffee shop w/ outdoor tables would have been a lovely spot to linger on a sunny day.

However, the day of our visit was cool w/ extremely high winds which made it difficult to enjoy the gardens properly. We went to the cafe in the castle to get out of the wind. There were lots of tasty looking meals & snacks to choose from. The staff were very pleasant & helpful as they had been everywhere else. We enjoyed our tea & scones - it's not every day you get to have tea in a castle!
We would have liked to have spent more time there - if we're ever in the area again we'll return to see more of the castle. Highly recommend!

The gardens are very well maintained and stocked with many interesting unusual plants as well as ones you might expect to see. We were particularly interested to see the greenhouse full of chilli varieties. The vegetable gardens are full of fruits and vegetables and we were pleased to read that these are used by the castle residents although some are for sale but sadly no apples at the time of our visit. The money is used to support the running of the vegetable/fruit gardens.

The interior of the castle that we could see with our ticket was exceptionally well maintained and clearly loved and looked after. We were particularly intrigued by the toilets which are located in one of the corner circular towers, with each toilet stall being around the curve and each toilet having its own arrow window so you can peep out while using the facilities!! (Don’t worry there’s frosted glass in it so no one can see you!)

Talk to the various Staff members who are interesting and very knowledgeable.

It certainly makes a difference that the castle owners actually live there as it shows in how the castle is looked after and kept in such a great condition.

We spotted a big turtle in one of the garden ponds.

54,9231,Arundel,5,"This is the real thing The other reviewers say it all. This castle and beautiful little town deserve the planning that it takes to get here. Arundel is a slightly out of the way village. That's good, as you don't want huge tourist crowds anyway. I had only time for the cheaper ticket, chapel and gardens plus entry to the shop and cafe. Those indoor areas give you some idea of the grandeur of the placce. The chapel is truly ancient and to me it did feel........ Well, awesome. The gardens are magnificent on a clear day. Huge stone walls surround them. Check the website as the castle has a long off season and is closed from autumn through to spring. It is still a family home, nothing like a ruin. You need plenty of time to see it to good effect. You would be disappointed if you set only 2 hours aside, that isn't really enough time for the whole thing. Take a small picnic to the gardens if you want, not a huge basket as you may have to leave that at security. Outside the castle the Arun River is nearby, where you will often see real white swans. Further up the road is a kind of Wetlands park, not cheap but it's supposed to be excellent for kids, and if you keep going, in under 15 mins you will get to a pretty lake with some nice walking behind it. It's just a pity that all accommodation for miles around is so expensive. Still, you can make it a day out, travelling from a hostel in Brighton.

It is a bit of a steep climb but there is a little golf trolley available which will drop you off at the entrance to the castle itself

The rose garden wasn't much but then I'm not into roses. We then walked around the chapel which was really interesting, we stopped to have a little picnic on one of the benches dotted around or you can sit on the grass.

We then went to the gardens which were amazing and then went to the moat ( see Characters from our History on their website to see where the meeting place is) and had a really good ( free) tour of the defences and history of the castle. The guide gets you all involved and uses any kids in the group as characters from history for example Queen Matilda and King Stephen

We then did a tour of the castle and motte which had amazing views from the top - it did help that we went on a fine clear day and had no rain.

There's a shop and restaurant at the end of the tour - we didnt try the restaurant but it looked very clean.

After this we went for a walk around the town and had a drink at the Black Rabbit which has great views of the castle

 please speak to the volunteers there, they have a mine of information!

We arrived to medieval music, horses and entertainment and that was before we’d even bought our tickets. (The system was down to prebook so had to queue for 15 minutes, wasn’t a bother with all that was going on).

On entering the grounds there was lots of stalls and things going on.. it was quite exciting!

We immediately heard that there was a Jousting tournament on and the first completion was about to start. What a spectacle.. first some warming up for the competitors and then the event began. It was our first time seeing an actual event
rather than the usual stunt shows. But this was definitely better and more exciting.

We continued to explore the castle, paying for all access and we were really impressive with the castle and all its rooms. So interesting and very well presented.

We had our two children, 9 & 5 and they really enjoyed the activities and tour of castle.

Being a HHA member we are allowed free into the gardens and then pay an upgrade ticket in the castle shop (Gold £15.50 for two).
 Why they open the gardens at 10.00 but you can not enter the castle state rooms till 12.00 I wonder why ?. Having experienced a small queue at the castle entrance we were surprised how little there was of people inside the castle state room tour (perhaps most wanted to visit the gardens only) and there was no pushing or shoving as we have experienced at some properties. My wife and I enjoyed the free flow tour but we both think that audio description would be good for more information of the castle history. Well worth the time and monies.

Note that The Main Castle Rooms don't open till 12, this isn't really an issue as you can go around the Gardens, Grounds or The Keep first if you so wish.

There are various different levels of Tickets, which admit you to a differing level of areas. I'd suggest going for the Gold ticket as this lets you view everything apart from the Castle Bedrooms. When you're going around the rest of the rooms if you so decide you went to see the bedrooms then you can simply upgrade when you get there for an extra £2.

The castle is in an excellent state of repair and I was really quite impressed, along with the guides knowledge do ask them some questions because they have quite a bit of extra detail they can provide around the various different rooms, the library for example has 10,000 books within.

The Keep (the oldest part of the castle) is currently going through a bit of renovation awaiting sign-off from English Heritage but you can still get some excellent views from this vantage point.

We looked around the castle rooms in the morning, taking lunch in the restaurant. Portions we found were a good size, and lots of seasonal specials which reflected the weather which was good to see, I opted for the Caesar Salad, but you could easily bring a picnic to eat in the grounds if you so wished. You can also come and go as you please, you just need to get a hand stamp to be re-admitted.

The gardens were quite spectacular with a cottage garden with lots of fruit and veg been grown and also a more tropical garden as well. As well as this there is greenhouses to look around and extensive grounds you can walk around, along with a beautiful rose garden when they're in season.

BEST EVER!
WORTH A DETOUR!
Worth several detours. You MUST see it (if you’re interested in English history and how this Catholic family kept its collective head(s) (mostly) at a time (Henry VIII, Eliz I) when so many were losing theirs.)
The grounds: beautiful. So well kept.
The divided Fitzalan chapel: so interesting. Never seen a divided church before. Go and see St Nicholas church too, to see the other side.
The Keep: impressive.
The main building: fantastic. I mean... there are relics from Mary, Queen of Scots: the gold rosary beads she held at the time of her execution. Who knew that such things existed (still)?

It is all so good.

I read somewhere that if you want an indicator of how good, or not, an attraction is, go to the toilets. The toilets here: in the gardens; in the house are the best too.

The view of the castle and cathedral as we drove towards the town was absolutely stunning.

Big car park opposite the entrance with good toilet block and disabled facilities. We had lunch in a lovely tea room in the town a very short walk away.

My husband is in a wheelchair and from the moment we entered the gate till we left, we felt the staff were without question the best we have come across, so helpful and friendly.

We were advised what tickets to buy and the disabled van called to take us to the farthest point and we made our own way back down. The gardens are stunning, with an architectural section, greenhouses, a flower section and kitchen garden. All thriving. Good toilet block here and places to sit and a stunning view of the cathedral.

Next stop was the chapel and white garden. So much history and beauty. The lady in here reminded us of Joanna Lumley, gorgeous and went out of her way to help.

Then into the castle itself. We were led to a couple of different elevators, the second was tiny, to get to the start of the tour. Right from the start the castle rooms and fascinating history blew us away. The sheer size, elegant furnishings and decor, artwork etc, just breathtaking. Our one tiny annoyance was apparently our tickets didn’t allow entry to the bedrooms. Gold not gold plus. I think the ticket lady had assumed I would not want to see the bedrooms if my husband could not get up there.

There are lots of interesting things to see spanning many centuries of history and the gardens are some of the best planned, best planted gardens I have visited tended by enthusiastic staff. It is worth buying the gold ticket because it enables you to visit the bedrooms which are worth a visit and interestingly are still used when there are castle guests. The voucher that the gold ticket includes is redeemable anywhere in the castle. However, the star of the visit has to be the guide for the 'Dry Moat tour'. He is so informed, interesting and charismatic. He brought the history of Arundel alive, drawing in the audience to play characters from the history in order to make it all easier to understand and follow. He is absolutely brilliant.

149,9354,Arundel,2,"Really disappointing  For years I’ve been driving on the A27 and have always wanted to visit the impressive looking Arundel Castle. I wish I hadn’t as now the reality has destroyed the expectation.

Entrance is very expensive and also very complicated. 4 different price plans for a ‘normal’ adult, then vouchers to use at the over priced gift shop and cafe. You get asked at least 6 times during your visit to the castle to show your ticket.

The biggest disappointment was the lack of history explained. The information given as you walk around is in no sensible chronological order and doesn’t give any stories. You do however know the dimensions of a room, when it was renovated and by whom. I don’t care about that, give me some basic simple history please. Like in every other castle and historic home.

The wife and I were really looking forward to our visit and were left very disappointed. We were planing to bring the children sometime but we won’t waste our time or money now.

Please sort it out because it’s a beautiful place

We visited on a Saturday, slightly out of the main tourist season and the place was very popular with tourists, many of which were from outside the UK, which should help the balance of payments deficit!
There is plenty of parking in the town and opposite the main entrance for the castle.
As we are English Heritage members we got £2 per person off admittance but were not able to book online (which would have given us a £1 per person discount) so the net effect of being EH members was a £1 per person discount. I think it should change so that the EH members should be able to get a £2 discount + £1 online discount. Simply show your pass on the day to verify your EH membership.
What was a good idea was the way the gift aid works there. You pay more for your ticket but you get vouchers that can be used in the shop or café for a value that is £2 per person greater than your ticket. So we paid £4 more each but got a voucher for £6 to use in the castle – worth doing.
There is a one way people flow system in the castle and the staff don’t really like you going against the flow of traffic, as we did a couple of times. Saying that it got a little confusing about what level of ticket did what. We had gold plus £(22 pp with gift aid and £2 EH discount) so could go anywhere but once in the house we went past an area that people with gold plus tickets can access and then had to double back. To be honest I think one level of ticket should suffice unless numbers are trying to be suppressed in the apartments. Staff are friendly enough and will offer plenty of interesting facts if you engage them.
The café is nicely decorated with interesting chair designs, replicated on the high chairs, which is a nice touch. Drink and food was good and reasonably priced although the service / throughput was painfully slow. It needs re-organising – lots of people there doing stuff but not getting the customers through quickly at all. Come on Arundel you need to sort this before the really busy tourist season starts.
Another thing that is needed at the castle is an audio guide or a tour. There is so much to see and learn about it’s a real shame that these aren’t options.
Everything is immaculately presented and the castle itself is in tip top condition as are the gardens. Do make sure you take time to explore all the grounds especially the Fitzalan chapel and the amazing tombs in there.
You definitely need a full day here and to that extent the entrance fee represents fair value for money. A great castle but they could still make some improvements to the visitor experience.

The Castle hold events through out the year where families are encouraged to learn and interact with re enactors who bring history from past years to life. My godson of 8 years old had a fabulous time. He loved holding a sword and trying on some of the knights armour. We watched as the knights battled and the archers fired their arrows, he even had a go at archery himself. There was also a brilliant Birds of Prey display when we were there too. The castle grounds are beautiful and are very well kept. Inside the castle you can smell the history as you walk back in time. There are also many helpful guides on hand that can educate and show you all the wonders that the Castle has to offer.

If you into history its worth paying the extra to visit the bedrooms and living accommodation.
Gardens were in full tulip bloom. Not a horticulturist so would have been useful to sign the trees and age as some must date back 100s of years.
Jousting, birds of prey and ware stalls present this weekend. Fascinated by the guy making the chain armour. Each vest takes 1000 man hrs and has about 10000 links. Knowledge of their trade was very impressive.
Every person we came across even in the cafe and restaurant were professional, polite and seemed to enjoy their roles.

Different portions of the building are from different eras, so you see cramped medieval function to Victorian luxury. The castle is still used partially as a family home, so it has less feeling of cold preservation than other museum status historical properties. The guides, and even the grounds-people, were exceptionally friendly and willing to chat. It felt that they wanted to be there, and they were personally invested in wanting you to have the best possible experience.
However, despite the diverse and impressive architecture and features of the castle, the gardens really stole the show. The gardeners mentioned that the different plants bloom at various times, so that there is always something to see, and the landscape will evolve throughout the year. The tulips were extraordinary, but I would love to come back for the roses.
Finally, a trip for lunch to the adjacent town was an added bonus. The locals were also friendly, and quaint bookshops, antique stores, and mix of eateries completed the experience.

We had planned to spend a couple of hours there and go home for lunch, but ended up staying nearly until it closed! We found a large variety of rides, and thought it was great value - free entry, and £20 for unlimited rides which our 10 and six year old certainly got their moneys' worth out of! Staff were friendly and helpful and the whole place was very clean.

I would have expected the whole park to be a no smoking area, or for there to be a designated area near the entrance, as a number of people were smoking close to queues which was off-putting. My only other comment would be that something outdoors for little ones would be helpful, like a sandpit or some sort of outdoor softplay area. There is indoor softplay but you can't be in there with a little one if you need to watch older ones outside. After discovering he didn't like the spinning barrel ride my poor one year old just had to stay in his pushchair and watch everybody else have fun all day.

370,9672,Littlehampton,5,"Amazing day! I took my 4 year d nephew here yesterday and we had an absolute blast. We stayed pretty much the full 11-6 opening hours and used the £18 wristband (purchased online) with that i also received a stamp to go on rides with him for free as he is under 1.2m (by quite a bit, I reckon you could use this until they're almost 6yrs). As he was under 1.1m the only ride he couldn't go on was the big swing, aside from that everything was open to him, either in his own or with me sat next to him. I don't know if it's because it was inly the Easter holidays and not the summer yet, but it wasn't heaving as I had expect it to be, we didn't really queue at all, just waited for one ride to finish before jumping in to the next. The staff were lovely, he really enjoyed the drivable boats and the staff looking after them were really involved and helpung the kids move around and chase them, it really makes a difference (especially after 7 hours in a park 1:1 with a 4yr old, it was nice to let someone else engage with him while i guzzled haribo on the bench for sustenance!) The log flume was fab, but before you go on go to the photo booth next to it and buy a poncho! I didn't realize these were available until we had done 4 consecutive trips on it and were soaked through.... Photo booth sells pics from both the log flume and the caterpillar rollercoaster (also a big hit with him, and one go on it is actually 3 times round, so if you're buying individual ride rickets its decent value.) The soft play was fab, it's also included in the price of the wristband and includes a small under 3's area. I managed to leace him in there for well over an hour while i dried out (log flume) and drank tea (1.70, very nice), it has ball canon things which the kids fill ip with foam balls and blast around, looked like a really popular part of it. The whole soft play area was a really good size, and the entrance is staffed but you still need to keep an eye as they can't possibly monitor all the kids and who their parents are ( i just sat facing the exit and hoping he stayed put!) 2 big arcade style areas in the 2 buildings, plenty to do and crucially, lots of 2p machines with little stools for standing on (nice touch). The park itself is also dog friendly (I assume not inside though..) and its right in the beach so its ideal for a full day out if you don't want to stay glued to the rides as we were. I will be 100% returning!

Whilst we found the facilities to be excellent the food was an unpleasant surprise. The burgers in the cheese burger meal were virtually inedible, gristly and only just warm, as were the chips. The menu states served with salad but this consisted of a small amount of lettuce and a slice of tomato placed in the bun which made the burger even colder. We also ordered a bacon sandwich, the bacon was so over cooked, it wasn't just crispy it was incinerated - no moisture left in it and bitter tasting. We also ordered a chicken and bacon panini, the chicken was fine but the bacon was of the same type as in the bacon sandwich.

We didn't complain at the time as the food area was very busy (and slow) and we didn't want to spoil an otherwise pleasant day out with our family.

393,9718,Bognor,4,"Alice's Vegetable pies deter Hitler A splendid, little, quirky museum with lots of things of interest to me. The first thing I noticed was an 1897 playbill (for “Madcap Madge”, which I somehow must have missed when it came to Bath). I have never noticed this before but the list of characters included lines spoken by them - very useful for those theatregoers such as myself, who have a tendency to doze through performances - so we had one character who said “Blessed is he who expects nothing”, but another had the depressing line, “Time, please.” (hopefully not the heroine)
Then on to “Alice’s (wartime) Kitchen” where you can listen to her talk about her delicious vegetable pies and dried egg concoctions. I was intrigued to know that the BBC Home Service regularly broadcast an 8.15-8.20 wartime slot called “The Kitchen Front” giving advice to housewives just before they went out for the “morning shop”. (None of the weekly supermarket shop nonsense in those days!) However, Alice must have been telling little fibs - or perhaps her memory is not so good these days - when she spoke of later listening to “Life With the Lyons” on the wireless, as this didn’t start until 1950.
A photograph reminded me that my favourite comedian, Tony Hancock, had filmed “The Punch and Judy Man” in Bognor Regis. As a devoted fan, I have previously stayed in his parents’ old hotel in Bournemouth.
I also enjoyed the room full of old wirelesses, memories of being a kid, bouncing a ball around the living room and breaking the screen on my parents’ old “Philco” came flooding back, although the collection at the museum in Droitwich - those were the days for wireless transmission! - is probably more extensive.
A sign told me that beer was “watered down” during World War 1 - not sure whether this was landlords making their supplies stretch a bit, or it was by government decree - but the thought that “being drunk was seen as being unpatriotic” seems a bit harsh after spending all that cash on weak beer. (Personally, I’m still following the directive about “no-one being allowed to buy a round a drinks.”)
Altogether, very enjoyable and lots of fun!

We spent a good couple of hours in the company of the birds while, one after another, they flew perfectly for us. There is something about having a 6 pound eagle owl landing on your glove, with feet as big as your hands, that’s hard to put into words!

Apart from the beauty and power of the birds themselves, it’s obvious from the start that Kevin is a total professional. All licence and insurance paperwork is on display and as soon as you arrive you can see the birds are clean, happy and in perfect condition. Kevin’s dedication to his birds is obvious from the way he handles and interacts with them. They watch his every move and respond perfectly, even for us amateurs.

Here we met Sky - a female Harris Hawk who was just magnificent. Gloved up we walked into the woods and Kevin proceeded to educate and entertain us as Sky flew around us with regular and frequent trips back to our gloves to feed. I rate and review many things on Trip Advisor all over the world and I truly think this was the best I’ve ever reviewed.
Sky excelled herself when she roused some barn owls who flew across us and although Sky may have been tempted, she returned to the glove when called. She the proceeded to spot and catch a mouse in the forest underground. Some people may not have liked this, but it was true nature at work and just great to witness.
If you like nature, birds of prey and stunning scenery, this is a must for you.

So once again we both had an AMAZING time and we look forward to the next adventure! If you want to try something different, then why not try a Bird of Prey experience with Kevin? Trust me, YOU WILL LOVE IT!

We chose the owls because there are more birds to fly and less walking for the children. It was really fantastic, lots of handling and information in a very professional set up.

510,9899,Arundel,5,"A very curvaceous garden Initially, it was a dull morning when my Wife and I visited but there is certainly nothing dull about these stupendous gardens and the staff. Initially, we met the enthusiastic Pauline in the Gift Shop who told us that the gardens had inspired Beth Chatto to create her well known dry, gravel garden near Colchester, Essex.

The curved beds, gravel walk ways, superb naturalistic planting, the unmown grass in certain areas, the “river bed” leading to one of the best ponds that I have ever seen and the occasional statues, all help to make this one of the most interesting and inspiring gardens that we have ever visited. I said jokingly to Briony who deals with some of the propagation that she would be most welcome to come and create something similar in our garden.

I mentioned to Karen who was working industriously in the garden until I interrupted, that I could not find the sculpture by Marion Smith which according to the plan was located near the far pond. Sadly, she told me that the staff had come to work one morning to find that the sculpture was missing, presumably taken by someone over the back wall. Hopefully, a heavier replacement will be in situ at sometime

There is also a newly constructed Tearoom and very clean toilets.

Many thanks to the current Denmans’ Team and the late Joyce Robinson and the late John Brookes for creating and maintaining such a fine garden.",initially met enthusiastic pauline gift shop told u garden inspired beth chatty create well known dry gravel garden near rochester essex,enthusiastic pauline gift shop,"['pauline', 'gift', 'shop']",Shop&Amenties

You always receive a friendly and enthusiastic welcome.

We also always visit the cafe, which has a good selection of good quality food, cakes, etc and a particularly friendly and helpful serving team.

The only negative note is in relation to the refurbished toilet facilities - ‘cheap’ does not do them justice. I realise funds have to be prioritised however they are particularly poor quality and they detract from the quality of the gardens and cafe.

The centre piece is a machine that blows balls in the air which my grand daughter used to love. However, there is now only one ball and it barely moved. This area really needs cleaning and updating. There were lots of mums with toddlers but the area was empty - not surprising! There is also a floor musical piano in the under 4 area with only a couple of the notes working - a shame!

My daughter didn't go in the water, so I was left to take each dog individually to see how they would react, it was really warm water, quite a surprise for me, and obviously welcome. Both dogs were tentative but then 2 young brothers joined me in the water and befriended the dogs and asked intelligent questions and helped reassure the dogs who adore children. I struggled with the pebbly beach though, I wouldn't presume to say that I am a Princess but I felt that each pebble was like the pea in the Princess and the Pea story and ooch ouch they hurt, especially when the dogs were now reassured and delighted with themselves and decided to run like lunatics across the beach and back and excitedly run up to all children at full pelt, stop, invite to play and then shake excess salty sea water along with kicked up sand at them.

Why am I telling you this, my dogs can't be the only excited dogs at this beach, so be warned in case I am there again, only with one dog at a time though!!

I loved the beach though, there are pockets of sand where you can park your bum. The car park closes at 8pm I think and the parking was on grass which was great, although no shade for the dogs but there was a dog friendly car park too.

So after I suggested to my daughter that Climping would be a great place to take our new puppy, I became a little worried this charming little beach wouldn’t quite be representative of my happy memories. I read a few reviews here but decided to trust my gut feeling and leave very early on Sunday morning and have a whole day there.
I have to say that Climping exceeded my expectations, it’s more organised, clean and the cafe was a welcome relief from the strong sunshine. I can’t understand the bad reviews on here and I don’t get what people expect from a public beach with fab coastal walks where dogs can run free and play. My pup Cookie absolutely loved it and even the car parking charge seemed quite reasonable to get so close to the seafront for a whole day. Staff at cafe were helpful and friendly and we even got a free meal there. The most amazing part is seeing the dogs mingle and enjoy the sea without being restrained, everyone seemed very on the ball and I didn’t notice litter or anyone leaving dog poo around. The ice creams and chips weren’t any more expensive than what I’d pay in the area I live but we got to enjoy our food al fresco without the pressure of returning to the car or surrounded by shops.

The pool and facilities are available to hotel and members to use. Although the pools were pretty empty, there were not enough beds to go round and we had to share a bed as did others.
 From arrival to Lunch was 5 hours, which we knew when we booked. On arrival there was a machine upstairs to make your own tea or coffee. We were told snacks were available during the morning but were not. In the end we had to ask and were told only biscuits were available which we gladly accepted. All food and drink is taken in the lounge which is upstairs, so we were up and down several times.
Cream tea was included in our package but was inedible, with the scones being bitter to taste and of a sand like texture. We reported this to reception and were told they would be taken back to the kitchen , we were offered a soft drink as recompense but declined. We aware also told the hotel would be in contact regarding this but they never did.

It has a special place in the hearts and minds of locals, and never fails to capture my imagination. Cissbury Ring is what remains of a bronze age hillfort, when ancient Britons settled the high ground above present day Findon village and surrounded themselves with ramparts. The earthwork fortifications are extremely well preserved and remain to this day, enclosing a plateau marked by a trig point. Upon the plateau would have sat the roundhouses of the people that resided there thousands of years ago, pre-dating the Roman invasion of Southern England. There is a free car park at the base of the ring, though a more enjoyable walk would involve parking in Findon village (there's a free car park or spaces along the village crossroads, though this can be limited) and walking uphill from town. Cissbury Ring itself is completely free of charge. Paths from Cissbury head into Worthing town, or across country to Chanctonbury Ring a couple of miles distant, another bronze age site that was a later Roman religious shrine. From the trig point on Cissbury one can enjoys views of Worthing, Littlehampton, the coastal strip of West Sussex and other parts of the South Downs National Park.

The trail from the carpark to the plateau is quite steep but is extremely short. Despite the popularity with locals, Cissbury is one of West Sussex's least known special parts, and for naturists/walkers/history buffs is a must see if you happen to be in the area.

While I can’t comment on the gym as we only swam I can say that we found the facilities very average, albeit very new.
The reception area is large and has a small cafe to the side overlooking the large car park. There was only one person on duty when we arrived who was dealing with a gym membership enquiry so we had to wait some time to be able to pay for swimming (£5.65 for an adult).
Our group was 3 adults and 2 children (8 months and 2 years) and we used both the family changing cubicles and a normal one. Changing rooms were basic standard changing rooms with soaking wet tiled floors which as you can wear your outdoor shoes in are inevitably dirty and muddy, it smelt fresh though. Lockers were a good size and cost £1.
The swimming pools themselves were disappointing. What was nice about the old pool (and why we travelled to littlehampton to swim) was the temperature of the children’s pool which was very warm and great for the little ones but the new one is pretty cold.
The new pools have no atmosphere and felt quite unwelcoming. White walls and ceiling and very bright lights made it feel very clinical and cold. There is also nothing for the children to look at and they got bored and cold quickly.

We were greeted by friendly staff who gave us a full run down of what they had to offer, followed by a delicious cup of coffee. The driving range was immaculate and the new Toptracer system was great, we could play a virtual golf course which was amazing. We played 9 holes on the par 70 course, taking around 1.5 hours to play 9 holes which was good time. We were in awe of the course condition, bunkers were pristine and the greens were playing like summer greens!

A week later, we ventured in and I think we both agree that this is our new secret place.
It’s really small, very friendly, full of interesting people and serves amazing local beers.
If you come to Bognor (and I say this as a resident) spend a night here.
It’s the secret bar you hope to find when you go on holiday. It’s the secret bar you hope that holiday makers never find.

They had four large beer fridges, plus a couple options for refillable container to choose from. Since their prices were reasonable, we opted for a hazy pale and maple syrup stout to enjoy on a park bench by the river. If you're a beer geek, it's definitely worth checking out.

I hope readers will find my review and photos helpful.

790,10328,Bognor,2,"A lot of room for improvement I write my review based on visiting all of the Mr P arcades. I will not waffle on but here is the basics.

For starters, not all of the machines are on their best payout percentages. Their website claims they have the best percentage payouts, this may be true in comparison to other amusements but losing £1000 through a £70 jackpot machine is definitely not 90%.

Any machine player will generally know if a machine is worth playing. A sign for this is “being full up”. Mr P arcades refill their machines and I have experienced this personally many times in each branch. For example, a party time could be full, the coins are dropping, you win £50 collect it and only pays £19 before going empty, then they refill or flick the hopper top up switch after only refloating £31. The next player then thinks it’s full up but does his balls in.

The arcade opening times are very early to close, however, if you are a promoter of their business via youtube, they will stay open till all hours for you, but not to normal customers.

The owners will lend people money who they get on well with, but others they will not, not very professional.

The staff will empty machines whilst you go for a fag or to the bank.

The arcades never ever have enough pound coins in, staff always have to empty machines half way through playing to get coins.

No loyalty rewards given, where as other arcades you get some kind of rewards. However you do get some free play each visit, on certain machines.

Often machines spend weeks out of use because the owners do not drive. The staff on site do not generally know how to fix the machines when they malfunction.

The air conditioning is pretty much non existent in all 3 arcades. It’s very hot in summer and stuffy most days.

You may get refreshments but that has been abused so seems to be cut back a bit.

All in all, the machines are there for “nostalgia” and certainly as with any arcades you cannot “make money” from, it’s all entertainment. You can get lucky, or you can be very unlucky.

The reason for my low score is that the brand continues to maintain they are this that and the other but in fact they are not. I’ve seen various lies, various untoward behaviour, very unfair ethics. All customers should be treated the same, whoever they are. Opening and closing should be set. Filming of other arcade users without their permission should not be allowed. They will write essays on their social media to portray they are amazing people, which some fall for, but let’s face it - they are only in it for the money in reality, nobody starts a business just for the love, otherwise they would be skint in no time.",example party could full coin dropping win collect pay going empty refill flick hopper top switch floating,empty refill flick hopper top switch,"['refill', 'hopper', 'top', 'switch']",BeachFac

801,10335,Bognor,5,"The only arcade worth visiting - apart from Mr. P's other branches :) Arcades are pretty horrible places usually, filled with machines made by people who are just salesmen and have absolutely no interest in the products they are flogging, I live in Weston and wouldn't even think about bothering to go into any of them. Mr. P's however has a very different philosophy, old machines from the mid 80's to early 2000s golden era of AWPs, that are actually fun to play and with very generous payouts. You'll probably never be rich after a visit to any arcade - but at least after Mr P's you'll have a large smile on your face rather than a handful of worthless paper tickets :)

p.s There is a family section with pinball / cranes / 2p pushers / 5p machines as well as an 'over 18's area' where IMHO the best machines are. Yes, they have Crystal Maze in both AWP and SWP formats, Viz, Road Hog, Eastenders and many, many more.

For lovers of retro fruit machines you will be amazed at the huge selection of classic machines some of which go back to the early eighties. To keep everyone happy there is some moderns stuff as well together with pinball, skee roll, classic videogames, cranes and pushers.

The room was large and well equipped with a double aspect view over the golf course. Meals are served in an oak panelled dining room part of the house which has echoes of the boarding school it once was. The breakfast buffet choice was endless and gave us a great start to the day.
