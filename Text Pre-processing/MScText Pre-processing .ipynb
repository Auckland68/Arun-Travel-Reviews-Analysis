      "Best avoided As we were told the café was full (even though there were empty tables) we foolishly went to the kiosk outside to order food and drinks. It was barely organised chaos. The queue just didn't move, while they faffed about pretending to know how to prepare food and drinks. When we finally got to order they had run out of most things we wanted on the limited menu (sausage rolls and sandwiches) so we ended up waiting 20 mins for some chips to be cooked, which was only a small portion. The tables out on the beach were dirty, with rubbish underneath them. A poorly managed place, which clearly trades on its location. \n",
